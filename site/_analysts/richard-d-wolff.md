summary: |
  As the global economic and political landscape continues to shift in early August 2025, recent analyses highlight deepening contradictions within Western capitalism, the ongoing decline of U.S. global influence, and the emergence of alternative economic and political models.
  
  The most recent reports emphasize the accelerating economic divergence between the G7 and BRICS nations. **Richard D. Wolff** notes that while the U.K. faces economic contraction and the U.S. struggles with deindustrialization and a shrinking middle class, China and other BRICS countries are experiencing sustained growth. This shift is not only economic but also ideological, as the G7’s denial of systemic problems contrasts with the pragmatic adaptation seen in rising powers. According to Wolff, “the decline of U.S. capitalism and its global influence is now undeniable,” and there is a high chance that this trend will continue, with the BRICS bloc gaining further ground.
  
  Domestically, the U.S. is experiencing heightened political fragmentation and social unrest. The class system, fractured by decades of neoliberal globalization and automation, has led to a growing disconnect from traditional political affiliations. As Wolff observes, “the ideological and political fragmentation of the employee class” has fueled support for right-wing populism and eroded the base of centrist parties. This is reflected in the aftermath of recent electoral defeats for leaders like Macron and Sunak, with mainstream politicians failing to address the underlying anger stemming from economic decline. There is a high chance that this disillusionment will persist, driving further polarization and instability.
  
  On the international stage, the U.S. and Europe’s miscalculation of Russia’s military capabilities in Ukraine has resulted in a decisive Russian advantage, further undermining Western credibility. Wolff argues that the West’s overextension and denial of its declining power are accelerating its loss of influence. Meanwhile, China’s rise and the BRICS’ assertiveness are reshaping the global order, making multipolarity and the need for peaceful coexistence more urgent.
  
  Looking ahead, the majority of analysts agree that unless Western leaders confront the structural flaws of capitalism—particularly the lack of democracy in the workplace and the growing inequality—social and political crises will intensify. There is high confidence that the search for alternative models, including forms of socialism that emphasize workplace democracy and cooperative ownership, will gain momentum as dissatisfaction with the status quo mounts.
  
  In summary, the global system is at a turning point: the decline of Western economic and political dominance is fueling both domestic unrest and the rise of new global actors. The next phase will likely see intensified struggles over economic models, political representation, and the distribution of power—both within nations and on the world stage.

  - title: Is Capitalism Leaving the U.S. in Search of Profit?
    url: https://www.laprogressive.com/author/richard-d-wolff/economic-equality/capitalism-leaving-the-u-s
    text: 'Early U.S. capitalism was centered in New England. After some time, the pursuit
      of profit led many capitalists to leave that area and move production to New York
      and the mid-Atlantic states. Much of New England was left with abandoned factory
      buildings and depressed towns evident to this day. Eventually employers moved
      again, abandoning New York and the mid-Atlantic for the Midwest. The same story
      kept repeating as capitalism’s center relocated to the Far West, the South, and
      the Southwest. Descriptive terms like “Rust Belt,” “deindustrialization,” and
      “manufacturing desert” increasingly applied to ever more portions of U.S. capitalism.


      So long as capitalism’s movements stayed mostly within the U.S., the alarms raised
      by its abandoned victims remained regional, not becoming a national issue yet.
      Over recent decades, however, many capitalists have moved production facilities
      and investments outside the U.S., relocating them to other countries, especially
      to China. Ongoing controversies and alarms surround this capitalist exodus. Even
      the celebrated hi-tech sectors, arguably U.S. capitalism’s only remaining robust
      center, have invested heavily elsewhere.


      Since the 1970s, wages were far lower abroad and markets were growing faster there
      too. Ever more U.S. capitalists had to leave or risk losing their competitive
      edge over those capitalists (European and Japanese, as well as U.S.) who had left
      earlier for China and were showing stunningly improved profit rates. Beyond China,
      other Asian, South American, and African countries also provided incentives of
      low wages and growing markets, which eventually drew U.S. capitalists and others
      to move investments there.


      Profits from those capitalists’ movements stimulated more movements. Rising profits
      flowed back to rally U.S. stock markets and produced great gains in income and
      wealth. That chiefly benefited the already rich corporate shareholders and top
      corporate executives. They in turn promoted and funded ideological claims that
      capitalism’s abandonment of the U.S. was actually a great gain for U.S. society
      as a whole. Those claims, categorized under the headings of “neoliberalism” and
      “globalization” served neatly to hide or obscure one key fact: higher profits
      mainly for the richest few was the chief goal and the result of capitalists abandoning
      the U.S.


      Neoliberalism was a new version of an old economic theory that justified capitalists’
      “free choices” as the necessary means to achieve optimal efficiency for entire
      economies. According to the neoliberal view, governments should minimize any regulation
      or other interference in capitalists’ profit-driven decisions. Neoliberalism celebrated
      “globalization,” its preferred name for capitalists’ choosing to specifically
      move production overseas. That “free choice” was said to enable “more efficient”
      production of goods and services because capitalists could tap globally sourced
      resources. The point and punchline flowing from exaltations of neoliberalism,
      capitalists’ free choices, and globalization were that all citizens benefited
      when capitalism moved on. Excepting a few dissenters (including some unions),
      politicians, mass media, and academicians largely joined the intense cheerleading
      for capitalism’s neoliberal globalization.


      The economic consequences of capitalism’s profit-driven movement out of its old
      centers (Western Europe, North America, and Japan) brought capitalism there to
      its current crisis. First, real wages stagnated in the old centers. Employers
      who could export jobs (especially in manufacturing) did so. Employers who could
      not (especially in service sectors) automated them. As U.S. job opportunities
      stopped rising, so did wages. Since globalization and automation boosted corporate
      profits and stock markets while wages stagnated, capitalism’s old centers exhibited
      extreme widening of income and wealth gaps. Deepening social divisions followed
      and culminated in capitalism’s crisis now.


      Second, unlike many other poor countries, China possessed the ideology and organization
      to make sure that investments made by capitalists served China’s own development
      plan and economic strategy. China required the sharing of incoming capitalists’
      advanced technologies (in exchange for those capitalists’ access to low-wage Chinese
      labor and rapidly expanding Chinese markets). The capitalists entering the Beijing
      markets were also required to facilitate partnerships between Chinese producers
      and distribution channels in their home countries. China’s strategy to prioritize
      exports meant that it needed to secure access to distribution systems (and thus
      distribution networks controlled by capitalists) in its targeted markets. Mutually
      profitable partnerships developed between China and global distributors such as
      Walmart.


      Beijing’s “socialism with Chinese characteristics” included a powerful development-focused
      political party and state. Conjointly they supervised and controlled an economy
      that mixed private with state capitalism. In that model private employers and
      state employers each direct masses of employees in their respective enterprises.
      Both sets of employers function subject to the strategic interventions of a party
      and government determined to achieve its economic goals. As a result of how it
      defined and operated its socialism, China’s economy gained more (especially in
      GDP growth) from neoliberal globalization than Western Europe, North America,
      and Japan did. China grew fast enough to compete now with capitalism’s old centers.
      The decline of the U.S. within a changing world economy has contributed to the
      crisis of U.S. capitalism. For the U.S. empire that arose out of World War II,
      China and its BRICS allies represent its first serious, sustained economic challenge.
      The official U.S. reaction to these changes so far has been a mix of resentment,
      provocation, and denial. Those are neither solutions to the crisis nor successful
      adjustments to a changed reality.


      Earlier income and wealth gaps in the U.S., worsened by the export and automation
      of high-paying jobs, undermined the economic basis of that “vast middle class”
      that so many employees believed themselves to be part of.


      Third, the Ukraine war has exposed key effects of capitalism’s geographic movements
      and the accelerated economic decline of the U.S. relative to the economic rise
      of China. Thus the U.S.-led sanctions war against Russia has failed to crush the
      ruble or collapse the Russian economy. That failure has followed in good part
      because Russia obtained crucial support from the alliances (BRICS) already built
      around China. Those alliances, enriched by both foreign and domestic capitalists’
      investments, especially in China and India, provided alternative markets when
      sanctions closed off Western markets to Russian exports.


      Earlier income and wealth gaps in the U.S., worsened by the export and automation
      of high-paying jobs, undermined the economic basis of that “vast middle class”
      that so many employees believed themselves to be part of. Over recent decades,
      workers who expected to enjoy “the American dream” found that increased costs
      of goods and services led to the dream being beyond their reach. Their children,
      especially those forced to borrow for college, found themselves in a similar situation
      or in a worse one. Resistances of all sorts arose (unionization drives, strikes,
      left and right “populisms”) as working-class living conditions kept deteriorating.
      Making matters worse, mass media celebrated the stupefying wealth of those few
      who profited most from neoliberal globalization. In the U.S., phenomena like former
      President Donald Trump, Vermont’s independent Senator Bernie Sanders, white supremacy,
      unionization, strikes, explicit anti-capitalism, “culture” wars, and frequently
      bizarre political extremism reflect deepening social divisions. Many in the U.S.
      feel betrayed after being abandoned by capitalism. Their differing explanations
      for the betrayal exacerbate the widely held sense of crisis in the nation.


      Capitalism’s global relocation helped raise the total GDP of the BRICS nations
      (China + allies) well above that of the G7 (U.S. + allies). For all the countries
      of the Global South, their appeals for development assistance can now be directed
      to two possible respondents (China and the U.S.), not just the one in the West.
      When Chinese entities invest in Africa, of course their investments are structured
      to help both donors and recipients. Whether the relationship between them is imperialist
      or not depends on the specifics of the relationship, and its balance of net gains.
      Those gains for the BRICS will likely be substantial. Russia’s adjustment to Ukraine-related
      sanctions against it not only led it to lean more on BRICS but likewise intensified
      the economic interactions among BRICS members. Existing economic links and conjoint
      projects among them grew. New ones are fast emerging. Unsurprisingly, additional
      countries in the Global South have recently requested BRICS membership.


      Capitalism has moved on, abandoning its old centers and thereby pushing its problems
      and divisions to crisis levels. Because profits still flow back to the old centers,
      those there gathering the profits delude their countries and themselves into thinking
      all is well in and for global capitalism. Because those profits sharply aggravate
      economic inequalities, social crises there deepen. For example, the wave of labor
      militancy sweeping across nearly all U.S. industries reflects anger and resentment
      against those inequalities. The hysterical scapegoating of various minorities
      by right-wing demagogues and movements is another reflection of the worsening
      difficulties. Yet another is the growing realization that the problem, at its
      root, is the capitalist system. All of these are components of today’s crisis.


      Even in capitalism’s new dynamic centers, a critical socialist question returns
      to agitate people’s minds. Is the new centers’ organization of workplaces—retaining
      the old capitalist model of employers vs. employees in both private and state
      enterprises—desirable or sustainable? Is it acceptable for a small group, employers,
      exclusively and unaccountably to make most key workplace decisions (what, where,
      and how to produce and what to do with the profits)? That is clearly undemocratic.
      Employees in capitalism’s new centers already question the system; some have begun
      to challenge and move against it. Where those new centers celebrate some variety
      of socialism, employees will more likely (and sooner) resist subordination to
      the residues of capitalism in their workplaces.

    paragraph_summary: The article discusses the historical shifts in U.S. capitalism,
      beginning in New England and moving through various regions, ultimately leading
      to a significant relocation of production and investments overseas, particularly
      to China and other developing nations. This exodus, driven by the pursuit of higher
      profits and lower wages abroad, has resulted in the decline of traditional manufacturing
      centers in the U.S., contributing to stagnating wages, widening income inequality,
      and a crisis of the middle class. The rise of neoliberalism and globalization
      has obscured the negative impacts of these changes, as profits have primarily
      benefited the wealthy elite while exacerbating social divisions and discontent
      among the working class. The article also highlights the challenges posed by the
      economic rise of China and its BRICS allies, which now compete with the U.S. and
      offer alternative development partnerships to the Global South. As capitalism
      continues to evolve, questions arise about the sustainability and democratic nature
      of its organizational structures, prompting resistance and calls for change among
      workers in both old and new economic centers.

  - title: U.S. Leaders Split on China Policy
    url: https://www.laprogressive.com/author/richard-d-wolff/foreign-policy/china-policy
    text: 'On the one hand, U.S. policy aims to constrain China’s economic, political,
      and military development because it has now become the United States’ chief economic
      competitor and thus enemy. On the other hand, U.S. policy seeks to secure the
      many benefits to the United States of its companies’ trade with and investments
      in China. U.S. debates over “decoupling” the two countries’ economies versus the
      milder version of the same thing—“de-risking”—exemplify, on both sides, U.S. policy’s
      split approach to China.


      The difficult reality for the United States is economic dependence on the world’s
      number two economy that deepens with China’s relentless march toward becoming
      the world’s number one. Likewise, China’s stunningly rapid growth over recent
      decades entangled it in a complex economic codependence with the U.S. market,
      the U.S. dollar, and U.S. interest rates. In stark contrast, neither the Soviet
      Union nor Russia ever offered the U.S. economic opportunities or competitive challenges
      comparable to what China now does. In this context, consider World Bank 2022 data
      on GDPs in Russia, Germany, China, and the United States: $1.5 trillion, $3.9
      trillion, $14.7 trillion, and $20.9 trillion, respectively.


      The political right wings of both major U.S. political parties and the military-industrial
      complex have long prevailed in shaping how U.S. mainstream media treat the country’s
      foreign policies.


      The political right wings of both major U.S. political parties and the military-industrial
      complex have long prevailed in shaping how U.S. mainstream media treat the country’s
      foreign policies. Over the last decade especially, the media has increasingly
      accused China of aggressively expanding its global influence, of authoritarianism
      at home, and of policies targeting the United States. Over recent decades, big
      business interests promote a quite different U.S. foreign policy prioritizing
      profitable coexistence between the United States and China. U.S. policy splits
      and oscillates between these two poles. One day Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase
      bank and U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen go to Beijing to support mutuality
      of interests while at the same time, President Biden labels Xi Jinping a “dictator.”


      The history and legacy of the Cold War accustomed U.S. media, politicians, and
      academics to traffic in hyperbolic denunciations of communism plus parties and
      governments they link to it. Right-wing political forces have always been eager
      to update anti-Soviet, Cold War logics and slogans for use against China’s government
      and Communist Party as continuing villains. Old (Taiwan and Hong Kong) and new
      issues (Uyghurs) mark an ongoing campaign.


      Yet as the Cold War wound down and then collapsed with the USSR’s demise, Nixon
      and Kissinger reconnected with a China already launched on an economic development
      surge that never stopped. Capitalists from the system’s old centers in the G7
      (Western Europe, North America, and Japan) poured investments into China to profit
      from its relatively much lower wages and its rapidly growing internal market.
      Over the last 50 years, consumer goods and capital goods flowed out of factories
      in China to markets around the world. China became deeply entangled in global
      supply chains. Exports from China brought an inflow of payments in U.S. dollars.
      China lent many of those dollars back to the U.S. Treasury to fund its growing
      budget deficits. China joined Japan as the two major creditor countries of the
      United States, the world’s greatest debtor country.


      China’s investment of its accumulating dollars in U.S. Treasury bonds helped to
      enable the fast-rising U.S. national debt over the last half-century. That helped
      keep U.S. interest rates low to fuel U.S. economic growth and its recoveries from
      several economic crashes. China’s relatively low-priced exports reflected its
      low wages and active government development supports. Those exports to the United
      States helped prevent inflation over most of those years. In turn, low prices
      reduced pressures from employees for higher wages and thereby supported U.S. capitalists’
      profits. In these and still other ways, U.S.-China connections became deeply embedded
      in the functioning and success of U.S. capitalism. Cutting those connections would
      risk very adverse economic consequences for the United States.


      Moreover, many proposals favoring such cutting are ineffective and ill-informed
      fantasies. If the U.S. government could force United States and other multinational
      corporations to close up shop in China, they would most likely move to other low-wage
      Asian locations. They would not return to the United States because its wages
      and other expenses are too high and thus non-competitive. Where they do go will
      entail sourcing inputs from China, already their most competitive producer. In
      short, forcing capitalists to leave China will help the United States minimally
      and hurt the Chinese minimally as well. Closing off the China market for U.S.
      microchip-makers is likewise a faulty fantasy. Without access to the booming Chinese
      market, U.S.-based companies will be uncompetitive with other chip-makers based
      in countries not closed out of the Chinese market.


      U.S. capitalism needs the inflow of most Chinese exports and needs inclusion in
      China’s markets. U.S. megabanks need access to China’s fast-growing markets or
      else European, Japanese, and Chinese banks will eventually outcompete the U.S.
      banks. Even if the United States could force or maneuver G7 banks to join a U.S.-led
      exit from China, China’s banks and those of its allies in India, Russia, Brazil,
      and South Africa (the BRICS) would control access to the profitable financing
      of China’s growth. In terms of aggregate GDPs, the BRICS are already a bigger
      economic system, taken together, than the G7 taken together, and the gap between
      them keeps widening.


      Were the United States to pursue its resumed Cold War crusade against China—economically,
      politically, and/or militarily without nuclear warfare—the results could risk
      major dislocations, losses, and costly adjustments for U.S. capitalism. With nuclear
      warfare, of course, the risks are still larger. Other than extreme parts of the
      U.S. right wing, no one wants to take such risks. The United States’ G7 allies
      surely do not. Already they are imagining their desired futures in a bipolar world
      split between falling and rising hegemons and perhaps counterhegemonic groupings
      of other nations. Most of the world recognizes China’s relentless growth and expansion
      as the major dynamic of today’s world economy. Most likewise see the United States
      as the major antagonist tilting against China’s rise into a global superpower
      position.


      What many observers of the China-U.S. clash miss are those of its causes and shapers
      located in the extreme tensions and contradictions besetting the employer-employee
      class conflicts within both superpowers. Those class conflicts in the United States
      respond to this basic question: whose wealth, income, and social position will
      have to bear the major burden of accommodating the costs of declining hegemony?
      Will the redistribution of wealth upward across the last 3-40 years persist, be
      stopped, or be reversed? Are rising labor militancy across the United States and
      the quasi-fascistic resurging U.S. right wing foretastes of struggles to come?


      China’s remarkable ascension rapidly transformed a rural, poor, agricultural economy
      into an urban, middle-income, and industrial economy. The parallel transformation
      in Western Europe took centuries and occasioned profound, bitter, and violent
      class struggles. In China, the transformation took a few decades and was likely
      the more profoundly traumatic for that reason. Will similar class struggles erupt
      there? Are they building beneath the surface of Chinese society already? Might
      the Global South be where global capitalism—the system defined by its employer-versus-employee
      productive core—goes finally to play the endgame of its profit-maximization fetish?


      Both the United States and China display economic systems organized around workplace
      organizations where a small number of employers dominate a large number of hired
      employees. In the United States, those workplace organizations are mostly private
      enterprises. China displays a hybrid system whose enterprises are both private
      and state-owned and operated, but where both types of workplace organizations
      share the employer-versus-employee organization. That organization typically features
      the employer class accumulating far more wealth than the employee class. Moreover,
      that wealthy class of employers can and usually does buy dominant political power
      as well. The resulting mix of economic and political inequality provokes tensions,
      conflicts, and social change.


      That reality is already well established in both the United States and China.
      Thus, for example, the United States has not raised its federal minimum wage of
      $7.25 per hour since 2009. Both major political parties are responsible. Yellen
      gives speeches bemoaning the deepening inequalities in the United States, but
      the deepening persists. In the tradition of blaming the victim, American capitalism
      tends to fault the poor for their poverty. Xi Jinping also worries openly about
      deepening inequalities: likely more urgent in nations calling themselves socialist.
      Even though China has taken significant steps to reduce its recently extreme economic
      inequalities, they remain a serious social problem there too. The U.S.-China clash
      depends as much on each nation’s internal class conflicts and struggles as it
      depends on their policies toward one another.


      China adjusts to the twists and turns in the United States’ split policy approach.
      It prepares for both eventualities: cutthroat competition abetted by intense economic
      nationalism possibly including military warfare or a conjointly planned peaceful
      economic coexistence. As China awaits the United States’ decisions on which way
      to guide the United States’ economic future, China’s growth will likely continue,
      matching and then surpassing the United States’ global economic footprint. China’s
      stunning economic growth success across the last 30 years secures China’s remarkable
      hybrid economy of private and state enterprises supervised by and subordinated
      to a powerful political party. An anxious world awaits the next chapter in capitalism’s
      always dangerously uneven mix of class and national struggles.

    paragraph_summary: The article discusses the complex and contradictory nature of
      U.S. policy towards China, which oscillates between efforts to constrain China's
      rise as a major economic and military competitor and the recognition of the benefits

      narratives have increasingly framed China as a threat. The article also examines
      the internal class conflicts within both countries, emphasizing that the U.S.-China
      clash is influenced by domestic economic inequalities and labor struggles. As
      China continues its rapid economic growth, the article suggests that it is preparing

    text: 'The real left is not the caricature crafted by the U.S. right. Alongside
      parallel right-wing political formations abroad, that caricature tries hard to
      revive and recycle Cold War demonizations no matter how far-fetched. Nor is the
      real left what Democratic Party leaders and their foreign counterparts try hard
      to dismiss as tiny and politically irrelevant (except when electoral campaigns
      flirt with “progressive” proposals to get votes). The real left in the United
      States and beyond are the millions who at least vaguely understand that the whole
      system (including its mainstream right and left) is the core problem. As those
      millions steadily raise their awareness to an explicit consciousness, they recognize
      that basic system change is the needed solution.


      On the one hand, the real left divides into particular social movements (focused
      on areas like ecological survival, feminism, anti-racism, labor militancy, and
      sexual rights). On the other hand, those social movements increasingly understand
      themselves to comprise components of a new unity they must organize. One key unifying
      force is anti-capitalism. Correspondingly, the different system they seek will
      likely be some new sort of socialism—with or without that name—particularly suited
      to 21st-century conditions.


      The other big problem for the real left—besides unified organization—lies in its
      lack of a compelling “vision”: a clear, concrete, and attractive image of the
      social change it advocates. To succeed, a new socialism for the 21st century needs
      such a vision. Socialism in the 19th and 20th centuries had a very successful
      vision as evidenced by its remarkable global spread. However, that vision is no
      longer adequate. In 19th- and 20th-century socialism’s vision, militant unions
      and socialist political parties partnered to:


      seize state power from the employer class; and


      use that power to replace capitalism with socialism and eventually a minimally
      defined communism.


      The transition to socialism meant that the workers’ state intervened in economic
      decisions and activities to prioritize social welfare over private profit.


      Seizing state power could happen via reforms and electoral victories, direct actions
      and revolution, or combinations of them. Socialists spent immense energy, time,
      and passion debating and experimenting with those alternatives. Seizing state
      power from the employer class was to be followed by using that power to regulate
      and control private employers or to substitute the state itself (as representative
      of the collective working class) for private employers. Either way, the transition
      to socialism meant that the workers’ state intervened in economic decisions and
      activities to prioritize social welfare over private profit. Beyond replacing
      capitalism with socialism, possibly subsequent moves toward communism were mostly
      left vague. Communism seemed to be in and about the (perhaps distant) future while
      politics seemed to call for socialists to offer immediate programs.


      So socialists everywhere over the last two centuries concentrated on seizing the
      state and thereby regulating markets, raising mass consumption standards, protecting
      workers in enterprises, and so on. Workers increasingly supported a socialist
      vision that foregrounded how socialist parties would use state power directly
      and immediately to help them. This vision fit well with socialist parties’ partners
      in labor union movements. The latter contested employers in enterprises, while
      socialist parties contested the employer class’s hold on state power. Thus socialist
      political parties and labor unions formed, grew, and allied nearly everywhere
      in the 19th and into the 20th centuries. Together they built effective, lasting
      organizations. After one of them prevailed in the 1917 Russian Revolution, most
      socialist organizations and parties split to form coexisting entities (ideologically
      similar yet often competing): one called socialist and the other “communist.”


      After 1917, the socialist parties (and most independent socialists too) articulated
      programs for “progressive” social reforms. The reforms aimed to control capitalism’s
      market structures—its labor, tax, housing, health care, and transport systems—and
      its cultural superstructure (areas like politics, education, and religion). Communist
      parties usually supported socialist reforms, but they went further than the socialists
      to favor state takeovers of capitalist enterprises. Communists viewed state-owned-and-operated
      enterprises as necessary not only to achieve but also to secure the reforms socialists
      advocated.


      The socialists’ and communists’ shared programmatic focus on the state complemented
      their critiques of capitalism in its predominantly private form across the 19th
      and 20th centuries. As socialism and communism grew across those centuries, they
      became the great theoretical and practical oppositional forces to capitalism.
      The more moderate among them defined socialism as a state elected to control and
      regulate private employers and thereby lessen private capitalism’s hard edges,
      inequalities, and injustices. Scandinavians and other Europeans experimented with
      such moderate versions of socialism. In Soviet socialism, the state’s economic
      intervention went further. Its communist party leadership replaced private employers
      with state officials fulfilling a state-generated economic plan. In yet another
      version of socialism—China’s hybrid one—a mix of Scandinavian and Soviet socialisms
      includes large segments of private capitalists and state-owned-and-operated enterprises.
      Both are subordinated to a powerful communist party and state.


      The common quality of all three socialism was the focus on the state. What most
      of the socialists involved in the three forms (Scandinavian, Soviet, and Chinese)
      missed was a shared omission. On the basis of admitting and overcoming that omission,
      a new socialism for the 21st century emerges complete with a compelling vision.


      The state focus of 19th- and 20th-century socialists, besides being a source of
      their greatest expansionary success, proved also to be a source of their greatest
      weaknesses and failures.


      The state focus of 19th- and 20th-century socialists, besides being a source of
      their greatest expansionary success, proved also to be a source of their greatest
      weaknesses and failures. Socialists’ and communists’ focus on the state combined
      with neglect of the internal structures of enterprises and households. But what
      if changing the macro-level relation of the state to the private economy from
      capitalist to socialist required also changing the micro-level of workplaces:
      both the workplace inside enterprises and the workplace inside households? What
      if socialism, to be achieved, needed interdependent changes at macro- and micro-levels
      of society? What if socialist changes in one level cannot survive without correspondingly
      socialist changes in the other?


      Human relations inside factories, farms, offices, stores, and households were
      rarely transformed by what 19th- and 20th-century socialists achieved because
      they rarely were objects of their social criticisms and debates. Enterprises were
      internally divided after socialists took power much as they had been divided before.
      Employers continued to confront employees as buyers of labor power, directors
      of the labor process, and exclusive owners of the products. States continued to
      control dimensions of that confrontation—more in moderate socialism than in capitalism—but
      the basic confrontation persisted. In versions of socialism where state officials
      replaced private citizens as owners and operators of factories, farms, offices,
      and stores, the persisting employer-employee organization of human relations inside
      enterprises invited criticisms. Some socialists thus referred to such systems
      as types of state capitalism, not of socialism.


      By theoretically not criticizing capitalism’s signature employer-versus-employee
      internal organization of enterprises, socialists, and communists took a big risk
      they likely did not understand. When the socialisms they constructed left the
      employer-versus-employee relationship of enterprises unchanged, that relationship
      reacted back to undermine those socialisms. Where moderate socialists used state
      power merely to control capitalists—leaving them their private profits—those capitalists
      could use the profits to battle socialists and socialism. As socialism’s history
      in Scandinavia and Western Europe exemplifies, capitalists have always done exactly
      that. They sought and continue now to seek increased private profits by reducing
      or removing whatever state controls constrain them. In that way, Scandinavian
      and European type socialisms undermined themselves.


      Where socialist state officials function as employers, the oppositional impulses
      arising among employees (strengthened by earlier socialist movements) will focus
      on the state. Worse still, employees struggling against employers in societies
      self-described as socialist may well come to identify their problem and adversary
      as socialism. In that way, such variants of socialism too undermine themselves.


      The socialist and communist traditions largely neglected the internal structures
      of households as well as enterprises. Thus socialist experiments in constructing
      new societies mostly omitted the transformation of those structures. Employer-employee
      relationships inside enterprises inherited from capitalism largely remained: so
      too did the inherited spousal and parent-children relationships inside households.
      We say “largely” because there always were exceptions such as communal households,
      collective consumption, and larger communes. Yet they remained marginal to the
      main developments and rarely proved durable. For example, early in Soviet Russia
      (1917-1930), Alexandra Kollontai initiated major programs of state responsibility
      and direct support for children and housework. However, European-style nuclear
      family households, constructed in and for capitalism during the transition from
      feudalism (see Jacques Donzelot’s The Policing of Families), remained the basic
      household organization under socialist societies as well.


      In the capitalist system’s prevailing household structure, men functioned as household
      “heads” responsible for disciplining and providing for subordinate wives and children.
      Wives were to offset the burdens of men’s labor in capitalist enterprises, prepare
      them for that work, and “raise” children to reproduce identical households. Such
      households should not only support families but also support the state with taxes
      (thereby reducing the employer class’s taxes) as well as soldiers. Efforts by
      households to obtain and secure state supports (schools, day care, subsidies,
      even veterans benefits) were systematically opposed or limited by the employer
      class. Even when won by mass mobilizations assisted by socialists such supports
      were never secure.


      To this day, the employer class that dominates in capitalism blocks raising the
      minimum wage, mandating paid maternal and paternal leave policies, and funding
      an adequate public education system or adequate health insurance system. That
      employer class keeps the traditional household in place or else financially constrains
      individuals fleeing traditional households to serve the employer class’s needs.
      The authoritarian structure of enterprises (complete with CEOs as dictators inside
      corporations) reinforces parallel structures in households. Socialists must recognize
      and act on the premise that the reverse holds as well.


      Socialism now needs to add a critical analysis of capitalism’s micro-level organization
      inside workplaces and households to its macro-level analyses.


      The solution for socialism in the 21st century is to correct for the omission
      earlier socialisms made. Socialism now needs to add a critical analysis of capitalism’s
      micro-level organization inside workplaces and households to its macro-level analyses.
      The focus of 21st-century socialism should balance the overstressed macro-level
      by a concentration on the micro-level: not as an alternative focus but rather
      as an additional focus deserving special attention.


      The solution for socialism and communism in the 21st century is a new, non-state-focused
      vision. Socialism becomes the movement to transform


      the top-down hierarchical organization inside capitalist enterprises (employers
      versus employees) into a democratic organization of worker cooperatives, and the
      top-down hierarchical organization inside households into democratized alternatives.


      Inside enterprises, each worker will have one vote to decide the major issues
      facing enterprises. Such issues include what, how, and where to produce as well
      as how to use the resulting products or, if products are marketed, what to do
      with the revenues. The difference between employers and employees disappears;
      the workers become collectively their own boss. Profits cease being the enterprise’s
      top priority or “bottom line” because that maximization rule prioritizes employers’
      gains over employees’ gains and capital’s interests over those of labor. In democratized
      enterprises, profits instead become one among many democratically determined enterprise
      goals. Each worker has an equal opportunity to fill in the outlines of such a
      version of socialism with the creative imaginings of what such a transformed enterprise
      may make possible.


      Inside households, socialism must stand for the freedom to construct different
      kinds of human relations. Kinship becomes only one of many options. Among adults,
      democratic household decision-making becomes the rule. Broad rights and freedoms
      are given to children. Responsibility for raising children becomes shared among
      parents, democratized households, democratized residential and enterprise communities,
      and a democratized government. The specifics of such shared responsibility will
      be among the objects of democratic decision-making by all. Whatever may remain
      of centralized and decentralized state apparatuses will support the new socialism’s
      households generously as capitalism never did. The twin reproductions—of democratic
      households and democratic enterprises—will be equal social responsibilities: 21st-century
      socialism’s notion of work-life balance.


      The twin reproductions—of democratic households and democratic enterprises—will
      be equal social responsibilities: 21st-century socialism’s notion of work-life
      balance.


      Such reorganizations of enterprises and households define socialism for the 21st
      century in a new way. Social change becomes a lived daily experience in each enterprise
      and household (more profound than mere changes from private to state-regulated,
      controlled, or owned enterprises). Such a redefined socialism can defeat the anti-socialist
      movements that have long contested state power versus individual power and that
      dogmatically endorsed the nuclear family against all alternative household structures.
      It revives elements of socialism’s complicated history of alliance with anarchism.


      Democratic worker cooperatives become a key institutional foundation of whatever
      state apparatus survives. Worker co-ops, democratized households, and individuals
      will be the state’s three revenue sources and thus key sources of its power. They
      will democratically decide how to divide the provision of such revenue among themselves.
      Undemocratically organized institutions—such as capitalist enterprises or traditional
      households—will no longer undermine democratically organized politics. Instead
      democratic economic, political, and household organizations will collaborate,
      interact, and share responsibilities for social development and social reproduction.


      Democratically transformed enterprises and households are socialist goals well
      worth fighting for. So too is a state controlled by and thus responsive to individuals
      within democratically organized households, residential communities, and worker-co-op
      enterprises. Together these goals comprise an effective, attractive new vision
      to define and motivate a socialism for the 21st century. One of its banners might
      proclaim, “No king or dictator in politics; no boss or CEO at work; no patriarch
      or head at home.”

  - title: 'A Reality Check: Economic Growth in G7 Versus BRICS'
    url: https://www.laprogressive.com/author/richard-d-wolff/economic-equality/g7-versus-brics
    text: 'We are confronted with a combination of denials and pretenses that are caused
      by the conjoined decline of U.S. capitalism and its global empire.


      In the United Kingdom, the BBC prepared and published data from the International
      Monetary Fund (IMF) in January about different nations’ growth forecasts for 2023
      and 2024. The BBC foregrounded some really bad news for the UK. Of nine major
      industrial economies—the G7 (the U.S., Canada, Japan, Germany, the UK, France,
      and Canada), plus Russia, and China—the UK would be the only one to suffer real
      economic decline: a contraction in its 2023 GDP (its total annual, national output
      of goods and services).


      So dubious a distinction for the UK followed the long political night of rule
      by the Conservative Party. That night’s darker moments included austerity after
      the severe 2008-2009 global capitalist crash, scapegoating Europe for the UK’s
      economic troubles, Brexit taking place during the peak of that scapegoating, enjoyment
      of COVID cocktail parties by former Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s government
      that it prohibited for the British public, and endless, transparent, and cringeworthy
      lying to the public when caught and exposed. But the BBC’s report on the new IMF
      data was shocking about far more than the poor performance of the UK economy.


      For the rest of 2023, the IMF says China’s GDP will grow more than 5 percent or
      more than twice Japan’s GDP growth rate. All other G7 countries will grow their
      GDPs more slowly than Japan. China’s growth rate will be more than triple that
      of the U.S. in 2023. Finally, the IMF’s projected GDP growth for 2024 shows both
      Russia and China growing much faster than any G7 country. These comparative forecasts
      comprise a reality check that clashes with most politicians’ statements, mass
      media accounts, and propaganda barrages (worsened by the Ukraine war) emerging
      from the G7’s old capitalist establishment. The BBC report was thus both rare
      and arresting.


      For 30 years, skepticism and disparagements confronted China’s claims about its
      economic growth. When these attempts to debunk Beijing’s claims were subsequently
      proven wrong by the country’s stunning record of superior economic growth, the
      intensity of these efforts nonetheless mounted. Disbelief in China’s economic
      achievements grew even as in-person visits to China confirmed high rates of industrialization,
      internal migration and urbanization, and fast-rising mass consumption levels.


      The need to disregard China’s economic transition from extreme poverty to economic
      superpower status rivaling the U.S. reminds us of the Cold War-driven nonrecognition
      of Soviet economic achievements after 1945.


      The need to disregard China’s economic transition from extreme poverty to economic
      superpower status rivaling the U.S. reminds us of the Cold War-driven nonrecognition
      of Soviet economic achievements after 1945. A parallel nonrecognition figures
      again in the G7 sanctions strategy against Russia over the Ukraine war. For anyone
      seriously interested in understanding the momentous changes now sweeping across
      the world economy, one question looms. How do we account for the gap between what
      the old capitalist establishment says (and may even believe) and what is real?


      The answer is that we are confronted with a combination of denials and pretenses
      that are caused by the conjoined decline of U.S. capitalism and its global empire
      (or hegemony). Those declines have occasionally become clear enough, at least
      fleetingly, to observers within the old capitalist establishment. For example,
      such key moments include the U.S. military’s inability to “win” local wars even
      against poor countries such as Afghanistan and Iraq. Another example was the U.S.
      medical-industrial complex’s subpar performance in managing the high number of
      COVID deaths and illnesses.


      U.S. capitalism’s crash in 2020 and into 2021 was severe and then was followed
      immediately by a bad inflation and then a fast, destabilizing tightening of credit:
      not exactly a stellar economic record. Debt levels of the U.S. government, corporations,
      and households are at or near record levels. Inequalities of wealth and income,
      already extreme, keep rising. A public viewing such facts might reasonably wonder
      whether something bigger is at play beyond these events being seen in isolation.
      Might there possibly be a systemic problem?


      But before such a line of thought can jell into a conscious question, let alone
      any serious pursuit of an answer, denial sets in. A systemic breakdown seems an
      unbearable thought, so denial of systematicity is undertaken. Statements about
      specifics are carefully crafted to omit connecting them to their context of a
      declining capitalist system. Evasion of the systemic dimension leads to undervaluing
      the dangers each particular problem or crisis presents. Like rose-colored glasses,
      anti-systemic glasses make economic problems appear less dangerous, narrower,
      and more limited in effects than they actually are. The anti-systemic bias is
      a form of denial.


      Consider, for example, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen or other officials when
      they bemoan deepening U.S. economic inequality. They do not refute nor even seem
      able to imagine that within a declining capitalism, the richest and most powerful
      will use their positions to shift the costs of its decline onto others. For example,
      raising interest rates these days to counter inflation—instead of imposing wage-price
      freezes like former President Richard M. Nixon did in 1971 or imposing a goods
      rationing system as former President Franklin D. Roosevelt did in the 1940s—is
      an anti-inflation policy choice.


      The burden of this option falls more heavily on middle- and lower-income recipients
      than on the rich. Similar cost-shifting is entailed by a policy of huge federal
      budget deficits because they are financed by borrowing disproportionally from
      (and thus paying more interest to) the richest parts of society. Yet mainstream
      G7 discussions of those policy choices and deficits rarely link them to the decline
      of U.S. capitalism and its global hegemony.


      Complementing denial of systemic problems in G7 economies are loud pretenses about
      their good health in contrast to problems elsewhere. Like the repeated affirmations
      about a “great” U.S. economy contrasted with deep difficulties afflicting the
      Russian and Chinese economies. Ironically, those difficulties are regularly rendered
      as systemic, flowing from the “natures” of an “authoritarian” or socialist economic
      system. For example, in recent years, mainstream U.S. media reported that Russia’s
      ruble would soon “collapse,” that China’s building boom was collapsing, that China’s
      anti-COVID policies were wrecking its economy, and so on. Apropos Russia’s economy,
      the late U.S. Senator John McCain dismissed Russia as a “gas station masquerading
      as a country.” Around former President Donald Trump and President Joe Biden, the
      argument was often advanced that beyond all policy specifics (regarding tariffs,
      trade, sanctions, Hong Kong, and Taiwan), economic system change in China was
      necessarily a goal on the horizon.


      Reality undermines these denials and pretenses. That is one reason why they struggle
      so hard to obscure reality. For example, China’s economic performance, as measured
      by its world-leading GDP growth over the last quarter century, undergirds its
      confidence in and loyalty to its particular economic system. The BBC’s graphic
      only further confirms that confidence. By the same logic, that graphic challenges
      the systemic self-confidence of the old G7 capitalist establishment. Denials and
      pretenses are not likely to be sustainable responses to the widening differences
      between G7 performance and the emerging (and already larger in GDP terms) alternative
      gathered around the BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa).


      Of course, both G7 and BRICS are heterogeneous assemblages including many significant
      differences among their members. Nor is there any guarantee that either bloc will
      retain its capitalist or socialist components or make transitions between them.
      Relations between the G7 and BRICS, like any possible transitions among various
      forms of capitalism and socialism, are now crucial social issues and struggles.
      Social movements inside both blocs will shape those issues and those struggles.
      To do that, especially if wars are to be avoided, social movements will need to
      set aside denials and pretenses and face realities.

  - title: 'AI: Profit Versus Freedom'
    url: https://www.laprogressive.com/author/richard-d-wolff/economic-equality/profit-versus-freedom
    text: 'Artificial Intelligence (AI) presents a profit opportunity for capitalists,
      but it presents a crucial choice for the working class. Because the working class
      is the majority, that crucial choice confronts society as a whole. It is the same
      profit opportunity/social choice that was presented by the introduction of robotics,
      computers, and indeed by most technological advances throughout capitalism’s history.
      In capitalism, employers decide when, where, and how to install new technologies;
      employees do not. Employers’ decisions are driven chiefly by whether and how new
      technologies affect their profits.


      If new technologies enable employers to profitably replace paid workers with machines,
      they will implement the change. Employers have little or no responsibility to
      the displaced workers, their families, neighborhoods, communities, or governments
      for the many consequences of jobs lost. If the cost to society of joblessness
      is 100 whereas the gain to employers’ profits is 50, the new technology is implemented.
      Because the employers’ gain governs the decision, the new technology is introduced,
      no matter how small that gain is relative to society’s loss. That is how capitalism
      has always functioned.


      A simple arithmetic example can illustrate the key point. Suppose AI doubles some
      employees’ productivity. During the same work time, they produce twice as much
      as before the use of AI. Employers who use AI will then fire half of their employees.
      Such employers will then receive the same output from the remaining 50 percent
      of their employees as before the introduction of AI. To keep our example simple,
      let’s assume those employers then sell that same output for the same price as
      before. Their resulting revenues will then likewise be the same. The use of AI
      will save the employers 50 percent of their former total wage bills (less the
      cost of implementing AI) and those savings will be kept by employers as added
      profit for them. That added profit was an effective incentive for the employer
      to implement AI.


      If we imagine for a moment that the employees had the power that capitalism confers
      exclusively on employers, they would choose to use AI in an altogether different
      way. They would use AI, fire no one, but instead cut all employees’ working days
      by 50 percent while keeping their wages the same. Once again keeping our example
      simple, this would result in the same output as before the use of AI, and the
      same price for the goods or services and revenue inflow would follow. The profit
      margin would remain the same after the use of AI as before (minus the cost of
      implementing the technology). The 50 percent of employees’ previous workdays that
      are now available for their leisure would be the benefit they accrue. That leisure—freedom
      from work—is their incentive to use AI differently from how employers did.


      One way of using AI yields added profits for a few, while the other way yields
      added leisure/freedom to many. Capitalism rewards and thus encourages the employers’
      way. Democracy points the other way. The technology itself is ambivalent. It can
      be used either way.


      It is simply false to write or say—as so many do these days—that AI threatens
      millions of jobs or jobholders.


      Thus, it is simply false to write or say—as so many do these days—that AI threatens
      millions of jobs or jobholders. Technology is not doing that. Rather the capitalist
      system organizes enterprises into employers versus employees and thereby uses
      technological progress to increase profit, not employees’ free time.


      Throughout history, enthusiasts celebrated most major technological advances because
      of their “labor-saving” qualities. Introducing new technologies would deliver
      less work, less drudgery, and less demeaning labor. The implication was that “we”—all
      people—would benefit. Of course, capitalists’ added profits from technical advances
      no doubt brought them more leisure. However, the added leisure new technologies
      made possible for the employee majority was mostly denied to them. Capitalism—the
      profit-driven system—caused that denial.


      Today, we face the same old capitalist story. The use of AI can ensure much more
      leisure for the working class, but capitalism instead subordinates AI to profiteering.
      Politicians shed crocodile tears over the scary vista of jobs lost to AI. Pundits
      exchange estimates of how many millions of jobs will be lost if AI is adopted.
      Gullible liberals invent new government programs aimed to lessen or soften AI’s
      impact on employment. Once again, the unspoken agreement is not to question whether
      and how the problem is capitalism nor to pursue the possibility of system change
      as that problem’s solution.


      In an economy based on worker coops, employees would collectively be their own
      employers. Capitalism’s core structure of enterprises—the employer versus employee
      system—would no longer prevail. Implementing technology would then be a collective
      decision democratically arrived at. With the absence of capitalism’s employer
      versus employee division, the decision about when, where, and how to use AI, for
      example, would become the task and responsibility of the employees as a collective
      whole. They might consider profitability of the enterprise among their goals for
      using AI, but they would certainly also consider the gain in leisure that this
      makes possible. Worker coops make decisions that differ from those of capitalist
      enterprises. Different economic systems affect and shape the societies in which
      they operate differently.


      Across capitalism’s history, employers and their ideologues learned how best to
      advocate for technological changes that could enhance profits. They celebrated
      those changes as breakthroughs in human ingenuity deserving everyone’s support.
      Individuals who suffered due to these technological advances were dismissed as,
      “the price to pay for social progress.” If those who suffered fought back, they
      were denounced for what was seen as anti-social behavior and were often criminalized.


      As with previous technological breakthroughs, AI places on society’s agenda both
      new issues and old contentious ones. AI’s importance is NOT limited to productivity
      gains it achieves and job losses it threatens. AI also challenges—yet again—the
      social decision to preserve the employer-employee division as the basic organization
      of enterprises. In capitalism’s past, only employers made the decisions whose
      results employees had to live with and accept. Maybe with AI, employees will demand
      to make those decisions via a system change beyond capitalism toward a worker-coop
      based alternative.


      This article was produced by Economy for All, a project of the Independent Media
      Institute.'
    one_sentence_summary: The article argues that while AI presents a profit opportunity
      for capitalists, it also poses a critical choice for the working class, highlighting
      that the capitalist system prioritizes employer profits over employee welfare,
      and suggesting that a shift towards worker cooperatives could enable employees
      to collectively decide how to utilize technology for their benefit rather than
      for profit alone.
    paragraph_summary: The article discusses the implications of Artificial Intelligence
      (AI) within the capitalist framework, highlighting the profit opportunities it
      presents for employers while posing significant challenges for the working class.
      It argues that, historically, technological advancements have been leveraged by
      employers to increase profits at the expense of workers, who are often left without
      support when jobs are lost. The author contrasts the employer-driven approach
      to AI implementation—where productivity gains lead to job cuts—with a hypothetical
      worker cooperative model, where employees collectively decide to use AI to reduce
      work hours while maintaining wages, thus enhancing leisure time. The piece critiques
      the capitalist system for prioritizing profit over workers' well-being and suggests
      that the current discourse around AI should shift from merely addressing job losses
      to questioning the underlying capitalist structure that perpetuates the employer-employee
      divide. Ultimately, it advocates for a systemic change towards worker cooperatives,
      where decisions about technology use would be made democratically, benefiting
      the broader workforce rather than a select few.

  - title: 'BRICS vs G7 : Power Struggles Are Not Class Struggles'
    url: https://www.laprogressive.com/author/richard-d-wolff/economic-equality/brics-vs-g7-power-struggles-are-not-class-struggles
    text: 'Class struggles interact with but are different from power struggles. The
      ancient conflicts between city-states Athens and Sparta were power struggles,
      while within each, slaves and enslavers engaged in class struggles. Britain and
      France were absolute monarchies in late European feudalism fully engaged in power
      struggles. At the same time, class struggles between lords and serfs internally
      agitated both “great” powers. Now, after slavery and feudalism have largely ended
      and capitalism prevails globally, great power struggles exist between the G7 and
      BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) and among their member
      nations, as well as other nations. At the same time, class struggles exist between
      employers and employees in all nations. Power and class struggles condition and
      shape one another. Both have been and remain core aspects of history; so too have
      ideological habits of confusing and conflating them.


      Kaiser Wilhelm II, Germany’s monarch, said in 1914 as World War I began, “I no
      longer recognize [political] parties, I recognize only Germans.” He used nationalism
      to unify a class-divided Germany to help win the war. The Kaiser had been shaken
      by more than the increasingly serious struggles among world powers over colonies,
      world trade, and foreign investment. He was stunned too by the rise of Germany’s
      Marx-inspired Socialist Party across the decades before the war. Germany’s class
      of capitalist employers had been similarly shaken and stunned. For a country increasingly
      and deeply split between labor and capital, German nationalism was the employer
      class’s strategy both to thwart socialism and win the war. Key to that strategy
      was getting people to think (and self-identify) in terms of national and ultimately
      military struggles, and not class struggles.


      China’s network of alliances, especially the BRICS, confronts the United States
      and its alliances, especially the G7. The rise of China and the BRICS adds to
      their power struggles with the United States and the G7.


      Germany’s strategy failed. It lost World War I, the monarchy ended, and its Socialist
      Party became Germany’s postwar government. Socialism emerged from the war far
      stronger in Germany than it had ever been. Much the same was true for World War
      I’s other combatant nations. More or less all of them had used nationalism to
      mobilize their war efforts and to undermine and displace class consciousness.
      For the war’s winners, nationalism may have served its purpose for them to achieve
      victory. Yet, it did not vanquish or banish socialism. Instead, socialism captured
      its first government (Russia) and split into socialist and communist wings that
      each drew mass attention and engagement. Both wings spread globally and quickly
      in the 1920s and even more in the 1930s as capitalism imposed its worst crash
      ever on most nations across the world.


      Now, a century later, power struggles intensify and sharpen across global capitalism.
      The power of the United States, hegemonic during the Cold War, is now declining.
      The earlier decline of Europe, punctuated by the loss of its colonies and two
      deeply destructive world wars, continues. Both Europe and the United States face
      the stunning, unprecedented speed of China’s economic growth and concomitant rise
      to global power status. Already, China’s network of alliances, especially the
      BRICS, confronts the United States and its alliances, especially the G7. The rise
      of China and the BRICS adds to their power struggles with the United States and
      the G7. That rise is also realigning power relations between the Global North
      and Global South and, in one way or another, among all nations and within international
      organizations.


      The Democratization of All Workplaces


      Class struggles have likewise continued in all societies, thereby evolving in
      different forms and foci. Most importantly, socialists now focus decreasingly
      on the struggle between private property and free markets as capitalism, versus
      state property and state planning as socialism. Many socialists reacted to 20th-century
      experiences with state power in the USSR and the People’s Republic of China by
      shifting their focus. State power and planning, while not dismissed as socialist
      goals, were seen increasingly as insufficient by themselves. Something more or
      different was needed to yield the post-capitalist system that socialists could
      and would embrace. Socialists refocused their priorities on the transformation
      of workplaces. Based on a critique of the capitalist hierarchy inside factories,
      offices, and stores—and its social effects—socialists increasingly stress proposals
      to democratically reorganize production there. Each worker in an enterprise will
      have an equal vote to decide what, where, and how to produce as well as how to
      dispose of the product (or net revenues where the product is marketed). The democratization
      of all workplaces (households as well as enterprises) becomes a central thrust
      of what socialism has come to mean.


      This kind of socialism grew out of but also challenged the macro, state-focused
      socialisms of the 19th and 20th centuries. Thus, where state-owned-and-operated
      enterprises continue to organize production around the employer-employee dichotomy,
      they invite socialists’ criticisms much as private-owned-and-operated enterprises
      do. The same applies to democratic socialisms or social democracies where enterprises
      remain privately owned and operated but are subject, along with markets, to heavy
      state supervision, taxation, and controls. Enterprises’ private versus state forms,
      important as their differences are for other reasons, often do not differ in class
      terms. Both typically display the employer/employee internal organization of production.
      If going beyond capitalism to socialism means a transition to micro-level workplace
      organizations that are democratic, then such transitions apply to both public
      as well as private enterprises.


      Power Struggles Between BRICS and the G7 are not class struggles. No government
      among them is committed to replacing capitalism with socialism.


      This newly emerging socialist focus challenges both the United States and China,
      the G7 and BRICS, despite the different balances of state and private enterprises
      among them. Further, the now fast (and thus dramatically) changing power relations
      among them have impacts on every nation’s class struggles. For example, G7 sanctions
      against Russia over the Ukraine war, and their inflationary impacts on Europe
      and the United States, have sharpened employer versus employee struggles as a
      result of those inflationary and anti-inflationary policies in many nations across
      the world. One of those policies—sharp interest rate rises by the U.S. Federal
      Reserve—is squeezing nations with large dollar-denominated external debts. The
      squeezed nations’ employers and employees react in ways that often intensify their
      class struggles.


      One major past and present problem has been the widespread tendency to confuse
      or conflate power and class struggles or else to see one and be blind to the other.
      Partly, these problems resulted from nationalist efforts, like Kaiser Wilhelm
      II’s, to repress class consciousness. While other problems emerged when cultures
      refused or rejected class consciousness perhaps because of their mass media’s
      dependence on capitalist owners and advertisers. Often both socialists and anti-socialists
      contributed to the confusion and blindness. That happened when the Cold War (1945-1990)
      and its lasting legacy effectively persuaded many on both sides to equate socialism,
      communism, and the USSR as one pole versus capitalism, democracy, the United States,
      and the “West” as the other pole.


      Power Struggles Between BRICS and the G7


      In today’s newly emerging international economic order, contending nationalisms
      are again strong. Power struggles once again capture headlines: U.S. versus Russia
      and China, the G7 versus BRICS, and the Global South versus Global North. Power
      categories not only displace class categories from analytical debates about major
      world affairs but that displacement also invades discussions about nations’ internal
      affairs. Power struggles are routinely mistaken for class struggles. Or class
      and class struggles disappear altogether from discourses.


      The rise and struggles of the BRICS against the G7 should not be confused with
      class struggles. No government among them is committed to replacing capitalism
      with socialism in the sense of transition beyond the employer-employee mode of
      internal workplace organization. Nor is any government among them committed to
      replacing capitalism in the older senses of moving systemically from private to
      public enterprise ownership and from markets to planning. Yet within all of them,
      there are groups and movements that are committed to replacing capitalism with
      socialism in accordance with one of its definitions.


      Karl Marx and others saw the conflict between the British Empire and its North
      American colony, culminating in the Revolutionary War and the War of 1812, as
      primarily a power struggle, and not a class struggle. Those wars did not pit slaves
      against enslavers, nor serfs against lords, nor employees against employers; they
      were power struggles. However, within them, moments of such class struggles did
      occur. The Napoleonic wars were power struggles, yet within them too, struggles
      of serfs against lords often occurred. The Napoleonic wars among feudal powers
      both weakened them all and stimulated capitalist classes to push for an end to
      feudalism across Europe. In the last two centuries of wars against colonialism
      and neocolonialism—power struggles—there were many class struggles interwoven
      with them.


      The power struggles now between the G7 and BRICS will interact with the class
      struggles going on within both blocs. The leaders, ideologues, and mass media
      of both blocs focus chiefly on those power struggles. The advocates of class change
      must clearly differentiate power from class struggles if they are to focus mass
      consciousness and activism on the latter. Thus, the BRICS bloc is surely challenging
      the G7’s and the U.S.’s hegemony in the world economy. The power struggle of competing
      blocs is not, however, a socialist movement challenging capitalism. Nor is China
      or the Global South now mounting such a challenge. The power struggles of China,
      BRICS, and the Global South against the U.S., the G7, and the Global North may
      provoke new class struggles as well as influence all those already underway. How
      they do so will depend in part on how we understand and engage with the difference
      between power and class struggles.'
    one_sentence_summary: The article discusses the distinction between power struggles
      and class struggles throughout history, highlighting how both have shaped societies
      and political landscapes, particularly in the context of contemporary global dynamics
      between the G7 and BRICS nations, while emphasizing the need to recognize and
      differentiate these struggles to understand their impact on social and economic
      systems.
    paragraph_summary: The article discusses the distinction between class struggles
      and power struggles throughout history, highlighting their interplay and the ideological
      confusion surrounding them. It contrasts ancient power struggles, such as those
      between Athens and Sparta, with internal class struggles, like those between slaves
      and enslavers. In the context of modern global capitalism, it examines the rising
      power struggles between the G7 and BRICS nations, emphasizing that these conflicts
      are not rooted in class struggles, as no government among them seeks to replace
      capitalism with socialism. The article also notes the historical use of nationalism
      to suppress class consciousness, exemplified by Kaiser Wilhelm II during World
      War I, and argues that contemporary power struggles, while significant, do not
      equate to socialist movements. Instead, the emerging focus of socialism on democratizing
      workplaces challenges both the G7 and BRICS, suggesting that understanding the
      difference between power and class struggles is crucial for fostering class consciousness
      and activism.

  - title: Why Capitalism Cannot Finally Repress Socialism
    url: https://www.laprogressive.com/author/richard-d-wolff/economic-equality/repress-socialism
    text: 'Socialism is capitalism’s critical shadow. When lights shift, a shadow may
      seem to disappear, but sooner or later, with further shifts of light, it comes
      back. Capitalism’s ideologues have long fantasized that capitalism would finally
      outwit, outperform, and thereby overcome socialism: make the shadow vanish permanently.
      Like children, they bemoan their failure when, in the light of new social circumstances,
      the shadow reappears clear and sharp. Recent efforts to dispel the shadow having
      failed again, the contest of capitalism versus socialism resumes. In the United
      States, young people especially applaud socialism so much recently that think
      tanks like PragerU and the Hoover Institute at Stanford University urgently recycle
      the old anti-socialist tropes.


      As changing social conditions changed socialism—a process that took time—it sometimes
      seemed to wishful thinkers that the systems struggle had ended with capitalism’s
      victory.


      In fact, the capitalism-versus-socialism contest does not really resume because
      it never really stopped. As changing social conditions changed socialism—a process
      that took time—it sometimes seemed to wishful thinkers that the systems struggle
      had ended with capitalism’s victory. Thus the 1920s saw anti-socialist witch hunts
      (especially the Palmer raids by the U.S. Department of Justice and the Sacco and
      Vanzetti persecution) that many believed at the time would extinguish U.S. socialism.
      What had happened in Russia in 1917 would not be allowed to sneak into the United
      States with all those European immigrants. The grossly unfair Sacco and Vanzetti
      trial (recognized as such even by the state of Massachusetts) did little to prevent—and
      much to prepare for—subsequent similar anti-socialist efforts by government officials
      in the United States.


      With the 1929 crash, socialism revived to become a powerful movement in the United
      States and beyond during the 1930s and 1940s. After World War II ended, the political
      right and most major capitalist employers tried once again to squash capitalism’s
      socialist shadow. They fostered McCarthy’s “anti-communist” crusades. They executed
      the Rosenbergs. By the end of the 1950s, once again, many in the United States
      could indulge the thought that capitalism had vanquished socialism. Then the 1960s
      upset that indulgence as millions—especially young people—enthusiastically rediscovered
      Marx, Marxism, and socialism. Shortly after that, the Reagan and Thatcher reaction
      tried a bit differently to resume anti-socialism. They simply asserted and reasserted
      to a receptive mass media that “there is no alternative” (TINA) to capitalism
      any longer. Socialism, where it survived, they insisted, had proved so inferior
      to capitalism that it was fading in the present and possessed no future. With
      the 1989 collapse of the USSR and Eastern Europe, many again believed that the
      old capitalism versus socialism struggle had finally been resolved.


      But of course, the shadow returned. Nothing more surely secures the future of
      socialism than the persistence of capitalism. In the United States, it returned
      with Occupy Wall Street, then Bernie Sanders’s campaigns, and now the moderate
      socialists bubbling up inside U.S. politics. Each time Trump and the far right
      equate liberals and Democrats with socialism, communism, Marxism, and anarchism,
      they help recruit new socialists. Socialism’s enemies understandably exhibit their
      frustration. With so little exposure to Hegel, the idea that modern society might
      be a unity of opposites—capitalism and socialism both reproducing and undermining
      one another—is not available to help them understand their world.


      Handling life’s contradictions has always, for many, entailed pretending they
      are not there. Very young children do something like that when they encounter
      a scary dog, cover their eyes with their hands, and believe so doing makes the
      dog vanish. With time, the children mature and grasp that the dog is still there
      despite hand-covered eyes. With time, too, adults will grasp that making the socialist
      other/shadow vanish is a capitalist project sure to fail. One effect of that failed
      project over the last 75 years is widespread ignorance of how socialism was continuing
      to change.


      Over the last two centuries, as socialism spread from Western Europe across the
      globe, it interacted with very diverse economic, political, and cultural conditions.
      Those interactions yielded multiple, different interpretations of socialism. For
      some, it was an evolving critique of capitalism, especially its injustices, inequalities,
      and cyclical instability. For others, it became the ongoing construction of an
      alternative economic system. More broadly, millions were brought to socialisms
      that aimed to change basic social institutions (family, city, government) that
      capitalism had subordinated to its needs. The different, multiple socialisms debated
      and influenced one another, accelerating change within them all.


      One kind of socialism that became prominent in the 19th and 20th centuries (and
      still exists) focuses on economics and government. It criticizes how governments
      are captured by the capitalist class and serve its social hegemony. It strategizes
      that using mass struggle (and eventually universal suffrage) can free the state
      from its subordination to capitalism and use it instead for transition beyond
      capitalism to socialism. In the 20th century, this kind of socialism offered a
      framework for constructing a socialist economic system alternative to capitalism.
      Such a socialist system entails the continuance of traditional capitalism: enterprises
      owned and operated mostly by private capitalists, individuals, or corporate groups.
      What it adds that makes it socialist is a government (often but not necessarily
      run by a socialist party) that closely regulates and supervises markets and enterprises.


      Such socialist governments aim to moderate key effects of private capitalism including
      its very unequal distributions of income and wealth, extreme business cycles,
      and unaffordable access by the general population to healthcare, education, and
      much else. Progressive taxation typifies socialist governments’ means of intervening
      in otherwise private capitalism. Moderate socialisms of this sort are found in
      many European nations, in the programs of many socialist parties around the world,
      and in the statements and writings of socialist individuals.


      Another kind of socialism shares moderate socialism’s focus on government and
      economics but differs from it by transforming many or all privately owned and
      operated enterprises into state-owned-and-operated ones. Often referred to as
      Soviet socialism—because the Soviet Union adopted it a decade after the 1917 revolution—this
      kind assigned greater powers to the state: to set prices, wages, interest rates,
      and foreign trade parameters according to a state plan for the economy.


      Because socialists around the world split over World War I and the Russian Revolution,
      one side (more aligned with the USSR) took the name “communist” while the other
      retained “socialist.” Soviet socialism was thus organized and operated by a state
      apparatus governed by the communist party of the USSR. Variations of soviet socialism
      in other countries (Eastern Europe and beyond) were established and operated similarly
      by communist parties there. The Soviet and other communist parties always referred
      to the Soviet Union as a socialist system. It was mostly the enemies of socialism—or
      those simply uninformed—that persisted in referring to the USSR as an example
      of “communism.”


      A third kind of socialism, comprising a hybrid form of the first two, is how the
      People’s Republic of China organizes its economy. There the Chinese Communist
      Party oversees a strong state apparatus that supervises a mixed economy of both
      state-owned-and-operated enterprises (on the Soviet model) and private capitalist
      enterprises (on the moderate socialism model). It is roughly a 50-50 split between
      state- and privately owned-and-operated enterprises in China. China had experimented
      with both moderate and Soviet socialisms since the 1949 revolution brought its
      Communist Party to power. Based on its critiques of both prior socialist models
      and the stunningly rapid economic growth achieved by the hybrid, a focus on fine-tuning
      the hybrid model seems settled policy in China today. The criticisms and opposition
      from both the Trump and Biden administrations have not changed that.


      A fourth model is newly important in and for this century even though examples
      of its way of organizing the production and distribution of goods and services
      exist throughout human history. People have often organized their collaborative
      production and distribution of goods and services as self-conscious communities
      within larger societies. Sometimes such productive communities were organized
      hierarchically with governing groups (councils of elders, chiefs, kings, lords,
      and masters) paralleling how they organized residential communities. At other
      times, they organized productive communities more horizontally as democratic cooperatives.
      A rapidly rising concept of socialism in the 21st century differs from the three
      basic models discussed above in its focus on and advocacy for the organization
      of workplaces as democratic, productive communities functioning within society.


      This fourth model emerges from a socialist critique of the other three. Socialists
      have acknowledged the lesser inequalities and greater economic growth achieved
      by the other models. However, socialists have also faced and considered when excessive
      powers were accorded to and abused by states and parties. Among critical socialists’
      analyses, some eventually reached the conclusion that previous socialisms focused
      too much on the macro-level of capitalist society and too little on the micro-level.
      Socialism cannot only be about the balance between private and state enterprises,
      about “free” versus state-regulated markets, and about market versus state-planned
      distributions of resources and products. That limitation can and should be broken.
      Failures at the macro level had causes at a micro level that socialists had too
      often neglected.


      When socialisms left the internal organizations of production and distribution
      enterprises inherited from capitalism largely unchanged, they made a major error.
      They left in place human relationships that undermined chances for enterprises
      in socialist economies to reach socialism’s goals. A truly democratic society
      cannot be built on a foundation of productive enterprises whose internal structure
      is the opposite of democratic. The employer-employee capitalist model is that
      foundational opposite. Capitalist employers are neither chosen by nor genuinely
      accountable to their employees. In worker cooperatives, by contrast, the employer-employee
      division is ended and replaced by a democratic community. The employees are likewise
      and collectively the employer. Their one-person-one-vote decisions, by the majority,
      govern what gets produced: how, where, and when. They likewise decide democratically
      what to do with the fruits of their collective labor, how enterprise revenues
      will be distributed among individual workers, and as investment funds and reserve
      funds.


      This fourth kind of socialism repairs the other three kinds’ relative neglect
      of the micro-level transformation of capitalism into socialism. It does not reject
      or refuse those other kinds; it rather adds something crucial to them. It represents
      an important stage reached by prior forms of and social experiments with socialism.
      Previous socialisms changed because of their results, good and bad. Those results
      provoked self-awareness, self-criticism, and determination to improve the emerging,
      new forms of socialism. Capitalism’s critical shadow returns again to challenge
      capitalism by inspiring a powerful new alliance of its victims with its critics.
      That has been, after all, the goal all along: to empower and inform social change
      beyond capitalism, to realize the slogan, “We can do better than capitalism.”

  - title: Real Democracy and Socialism’s Self-Criticism
    url: https://www.laprogressive.com/author/richard-d-wolff/economic-equality/real-democracy
    text: 'All three kinds of modern socialism remain crucially incomplete in terms
      of having not yet gone beyond the employer-employee organization of production.


      Democracy is incompatible with class-divided economic systems. Masters rule in
      slavery, lords in feudalism, and employers in capitalism. Whatever forms of government
      (including representative-electoral) coexist with class-divided economic systems,
      the hard reality is that one class rules the other. The revolutionaries who overthrew
      other systems to establish capitalism sometimes meant and intended to install
      a real democracy, but that did not happen. Real democracy—one person, one vote,
      full participation, and majority rule—would have enabled larger employee classes
      to rule smaller capitalist classes. Instead, capitalist employers used their economic
      positions (hiring/firing employees, selling outputs, receiving/distributing profits)
      to preclude real democracy. What democracy did survive was merely formal. In place
      of real democracy, capitalists used their wealth and power to secure capitalist
      class rule. They did that first and foremost inside capitalist enterprises where
      employers functioned as autocrats unaccountable to the mass of their employees.
      From that base, employers as a class purchased or otherwise dominated politics
      via electoral or other systems.


      Socialism as a critical movement, before and after the 1917 revolution in Russia,
      targeted the absence of real democracy in capitalism.


      Socialism as a critical movement, before and after the 1917 revolution in Russia,
      targeted the absence of real democracy in capitalism. Socialism’s remarkable global
      spread over the last three centuries attests to the wisdom of having stressed
      that target. Capitalism’s employee class came to harbor deep resentment toward
      its employer class. Shifting circumstances determined how conscious that resentment
      became, how explicit its expressions, and how varied its forms.


      A certain irony of history made the absence of real democracy in socialist countries
      an ongoing target of many socialists in those countries. More than a few socialists
      commented on the shared problem of that absence in both capitalist and socialist
      countries notwithstanding other differences between them. The question thus arose:
      why would the otherwise different capitalist and socialist systems of the late
      20th and early 21st centuries display quite similar formal democracies (apparatuses
      of voting) and equally similar absences of real democracy? Socialists developed
      answers that entailed a significant socialist self-criticism.


      Those answers and self-criticism flowed from a recognition that in both capitalist
      and socialist systems, business enterprises (factories, offices, stores) were
      organized overwhelmingly around the dichotomy of employer and employee. This was
      and remains true of private enterprises, whether more or less state-regulated,
      and likewise of state-owned-and-operated business enterprises. In parallel fashion,
      much the same was true in slave economic systems: the master-slave organization
      of productive activities prevailed in both private and state enterprises. Similarly,
      the lord-serf organization of production prevailed in both state (royal) and private
      (vassal) feudal enterprises.


      Real democracy proved equally incompatible with slave, feudal, capitalist, and
      socialist systems in so far as the socialist systems retained the prevailing employer-employee
      structure of their enterprises. In fact, the three kinds of modern socialist systems
      all display that employer-employee structure. Western European social democracies
      do so because they leave most production in the hands of private capitalist enterprises
      that were always built on employer-employee foundations. Moreover, when they established
      and operated public or state-owned-and-operated enterprises, they copied those
      employer-employee structures.


      Soviet industries—chiefly publicly owned and operated—positioned state officials
      as employers in relation to employees. Finally, the People’s Republic of China
      comprises a hybrid form of socialism combining a mix of both of the other forms,
      a roughly equal split of private and state enterprises. China’s hybrid socialism
      shares the employer/employee organizational structure in both its state and private
      enterprises. All three kinds of socialism—social democratic, Soviet, and Chinese—broke
      in many important ways from the capitalism that preceded them. But they did not
      break from the basic employer-employee organization of enterprises, that relationship
      which Marx’s Capital pinpoints as the source of exploitation, that appropriation
      by employers of the surplus produced by employees.


      All three kinds of modern socialism remain crucially incomplete in terms of having
      not yet gone beyond the employer-employee organization of production. It follows
      that socialists’ self-criticism—that actually existing socialist systems fell
      short of their standard of real democracy—may be linked crucially to those systems’
      retention of the employer-employee relationship at their economic core.


      Employers and employees are, together, defined by a specific class structure.
      They are its poles, the two possible positions individuals hold in production.
      They emerged with capitalism out of the disintegrations of previous systems. Such
      prior systems included (1) feudalism and its economic structure’s two positions
      of lord and serf, and (2) slavery and its economic structure’s two positions of
      master and slave. Because masters, lords, and employers are usually few relative
      to the numbers of slaves, serfs, and employees, and because they live off the
      surplus extracted from those slaves, serfs, and employees, they cannot allow a
      real democracy as it would directly threaten their class positions and privileges.
      In actually existing socialist societies, real democracy’s incompatibility with
      class-divided economic systems is encountered yet again.


      Because this time it is many socialists who make the encounter, they ask why modern
      socialism, a social movement critical of capitalism’s lack of real democracy,
      would itself merit a parallel criticism. Why have socialist experiments to date
      produced a self-criticism focused on their inability to create and maintain authentic
      democratic systems??


      The answer lies in the employer-employee relationship. It always was the key obstacle
      to real democracy, the cause and literally the definition of those classes whose
      oppositional existence precludes real democracy. Those socialists who faced the
      problem of real democracy articulated it as a definition of/demand for “classlessness.”
      Without classes, no ruling class. If the employees become, collectively, their
      own employer, the capitalist class opposition disappears. One group or community
      replaces two. Absent a class-divided economic system, efforts to bring real democracy
      to a society’s economy and politics could anticipate success.


      Socialist self-criticism can enable a solution to real democracy’s absence by
      advocating for a transition from an employer/employee-based economic system to
      one based on workers’ self-directed enterprises (or “worker coops” in common language).
      The incomplete socialisms constructed in the 20th century need to be upgraded
      by making that transition. That would get those socialisms nearer to completion,
      nearer to real democracy, and further from capitalist systems whose undying commitment
      to the employer-employee relationship precludes them from ever getting closer
      to real democracy.

  - title: Total Absence of Democracy Within the Workplace
    url: https://www.laprogressive.com/author/richard-d-wolff/economic-equality/total-absence-of-democracy
    text: 'Amid and despite the G7 nations’ endless ideological celebrations of democracy,
      workers accepted the total absence of democracy inside capitalist enterprises.


      In 1863, the Russian social critic Nikolay Chernyshevsky published a novel entitled
      “What Is to Be Done?” Its story revolves around a central heroine, Vera Pavlovna,
      and her four dreams.


      It brilliantly intertwines her personal life and the social turmoil of Russia’s
      transition at the time from feudalism to capitalism. Chernyshevsky, a revolutionary
      imprisoned by the Czarist government, wrote a novel that was nothing less than
      a pioneering work of socialist feminism. In it, he also passionately appealed
      for an urban, industrial economy based on worker cooperatives, a modern and transformed
      version of Russia’s earlier agrarian communes.


      An appreciative Lenin entitled one of his most important political pamphlets,
      published in 1902, “What Is to Be Done?”


      Two decades later, after the Soviet revolution defeated foreign invaders and domestic
      enemies in a long civil war, Lenin returned to the theme of worker cooperatives.
      In Soviet circumstances, much changed from Chernyshevsky’s Russia, Lenin argued
      forcefully for the USSR’s activists to recognize the enormous importance of building,
      spreading, and respecting cooperatives as key to Soviet socialism’s future.


      Worker coops, he argued, answered the burning political question among activists
      then: what is to be done? Here I want to adapt and apply Lenin’s argument to today’s
      social conditions that are raising that same question even more urgently.


      Today’s capitalism is global—the basic economic structure of the world economy
      features its core employer-employee model. The “relations of production” inside
      enterprises (factories, offices, and stores) place a small minority of workplace
      participants as employers.


      They make all the basic “business decisions” about what, how, and where to produce
      and what to do with the product (and revenue when they sell it). They alone make
      all those decisions. Employees, the majority of workplace participants, are excluded
      from those decisions.


      Capitalism today is also globally divided into two major blocs: one old and one
      new. The old is allied with the United States. Besides being older, the G7 is
      now the smaller of the two blocs, having shrunk in relative global importance
      over recent decades. It includes:


      the UK


      Germany


      France


      Italy


      Canada


      Japan


      the United States


      The now fast-rising newer bloc, the BRICS, first included:


      Brazil


      Russia


      India


      China


      South Africa


      Recently, it invited six new member states to join, as of January 2024:


      Egypt Iran Saudi Arabia Ethiopia Argentina


      Since 2020, the BRICS’ total GDP exceeded that of the G7, and that gap between
      them keeps growing.


      The G7’s “mature capitalisms” all survived and grew because workers accepted the
      employer-employee organization of workplaces. Amid and despite the G7 nations’
      endless ideological celebrations of democracy, workers accepted the total absence
      of democracy inside capitalist enterprises.


      With some exceptions and resistance, it became routine common sense that representative
      democracy somehow belonged in residential communities but not in the communities
      at work. Inside capitalist enterprises, autocracy was the norm. Employers ruled
      employees but were not democratically accountable to them.


      Employers in each capitalist enterprise enriched a select circle by delivering
      portions of the revenue to themselves, to owners of the enterprise, and to a few
      top executives. That select circle wielded extraordinary political and cultural
      influence.


      It replicated the absence of democracy inside its enterprises by keeping the democracy
      outside them merely formal. Governments in capitalism were typically shaped by
      that select circle’s paid lobbyists, campaign donations, and paid mass-media productions.


      In modern capitalism, the kings and queens banished in earlier centuries reappeared,
      altered, and relocated, as CEOs inside ever larger capitalist enterprises dominating
      whole societies.


      Employees’ actual or anticipated opposition to democracy’s exclusion inside workplaces
      has always haunted capitalism. One major way employers can deflect such opposition
      is by narrowly defining their obligation to employees in terms of wages paid to
      enable consumption.


      Wages adequate for consumption became the necessary and explicitly sufficient
      compensatory reward for work. Implicitly, they likewise became the employees’
      compensation for the absence of democracy within the workplace. Rising levels
      of employee consumption signaled a “successful” capitalism. In stark contrast,
      rising democracy inside the workplace never became a comparable standard for evaluating
      the system.


      Making consumption the point and purpose of work contributed to a social overvaluation
      of consumption per se. Advertising contributed to that overvaluation too. Modern
      capitalist society added “consumerism” to its catalog of moral failings. Clerics
      thus routinely caution us not to lose sight of spiritual values in rushing to
      consume (of course, those spiritual values rarely include democratic rights inside
      workplaces).


      Confronted and outcompeted by China and the BRICS, G7’s declining empires and
      economies now risk that mass consumption will increasingly be constrained. In
      declining empires, the rich and powerful preserve their wealth and privileges
      while offloading the costs of decline onto the mass of employees.


      Automating jobs, exporting them to lower-wage regions, importing cheap immigrant
      labor, and mass campaigns against taxes are the tried-and-true mechanisms to accomplish
      that offloading.


      Such “austerities” are now in full swing nearly everywhere.


      They explain a good part of the mass working-class anger and bitterness in the
      older (G7-type) capitalisms expressed in gestures against social “elites.” Given
      capitalism’s long favoritism shown to its right-wing versus its left-wing critics,
      it should surprise no one that the anger and bitterness first take right-wing
      forms (Trump, Boris Johnson, Wilders, Alternative for Germany, and Meloni).


      The political temptation for the left will be to focus again as it did in the
      past on demanding rising consumption now that a declining capitalism undermines
      it. Capitalism promised a rising consumption that it now fails to deliver.


      Fair enough, but that is not enough. Often in the past, capitalism was able to
      deliver rising real wages and workers’ living standards. And it may yet again.
      Indeed, China is now delivering just that.


      The clear lesson is that the left needs a new and different answer to the question
      of what is to be done. Its criticism must effectively criticize and oppose capitalism
      when and where it is delivering rising wages and likewise when and where it is
      not.


      Now is the time to expose and attack capitalism’s deprivation of democracy in
      the workplace and the resulting social ills:


      Inequalities


      Instabilities


      Merely formal political democracy


      Workers’ goals never needed to be, and should never have been, limited to raising
      wages, important as that was and is. Those goals can and should include a demand
      for full democracy inside the workplace.


      Otherwise, whatever reforms and gains workers’ struggles achieve can subsequently
      be undone (as happened to the New Deal in the United States and social democracy
      in many other countries). Workers have had to learn that only democratized workplaces
      can secure the reforms workers win.


      What is to be done in the old, declining centers of capitalism is for class struggles
      to include the democratization of enterprises. A transition toward economies grounded
      on worker-cooperative enterprises is the strategic target.


      In the new, ascending capitalisms in the world, the BRICS, a different logic leads
      again toward worker cooperatives as a focal goal for socialist politics and organizing.
      Among the BRICS, the same employer-employee model organizes factories, offices,
      and stores.


      Unlike the G7, the employers are relatively more often not private. Rather, some
      employers run privately owned enterprises, while others are state officials who
      operate enterprises owned by the state. In the People’s Republic of China, where
      roughly half of enterprises are private and half public, nearly all have adopted
      the employer-employee organizational model.


      Where the state takes a large, major, or commanding role in economic development
      and especially where one or another socialist ideology accompanies and justifies
      that role, a turn toward a focus on worker cooperatives is now timely. It will
      attract many in those countries as socialism’s necessary next step.


      The “development” or socialism accomplished there—macro-level changes already
      achieved (via decolonization struggles and revolutions)—are celebrated but also
      widely understood as insufficient. Bigger social goals and changes motivated those
      struggles and revolutions. Democratizing enterprises takes “development” to a
      whole new level reaching toward those goals.


      There is yet another source of the answer that now responds to the question: what
      is to be done? The qualities of democracy that have been achieved within the G7,
      the BRICS, or most other countries, to date have been more formal than substantive.
      Where elections of representatives occur, the influences of wealth and income
      inequalities, the social power wielded by CEOs, and their controls over mass media
      render democracy more symbolic than real.


      Many people know it; still more feel it. Extending democracy into the economy
      and specifically into the internal organization of enterprises represents a major
      step in moving political democracy beyond merely formal and symbolic to substantive
      and real.


      And much the same applies to moving socialism beyond its earlier forms.


      The old cry to workers of the world to unify—“You have nothing to lose but your
      chains”—was an early, partial answer to the question: What is to be done?


      After a century and a half of development and socialisms, we can now provide a
      much fuller and more specific answer to that question. To get beyond capitalism’s
      core—the production relations of employer versus employee—we need explicitly to
      replace those relations with a democratized workplace, to substitute workers’
      self-directed cooperatives for hierarchical capitalist business.

    url: https://www.laprogressive.com/author/richard-d-wolff/foreign-policy/u-s-empire-decline
    text: 'The U.S. and Europe seriously underestimated what Russia could and would
      do to prevail militarily in Ukraine. Russia’s victory, at least so far, has proven
      decisive.


      When Napoleon engaged Russia in a European land war, the Russians mounted a determined
      defense, and the French lost. When Hitler tried the same, the Soviet Union responded
      similarly, and the Germans lost. In World War I and its post-revolutionary civil
      war (1914-1922), first Russia and then the USSR defended with far greater effect
      against two invasions than the invaders had calculated. That history ought to
      have cautioned U.S. and European leaders to minimize the risks of confronting
      Russia, especially when Russia felt threatened and determined to defend itself.


      Instead of caution, delusions prompted ill-advised judgments by the collective
      West (roughly the G7 nations: the U.S. and its major allies). Those delusions
      emerged partly from the collective West’s widespread denial of its relative economic
      decline in the 21st century. That denial also enabled a remarkable blindness to
      the limits that decline imposed on the collective West’s global actions. Delusions
      also flowed from a basic undervaluation of Russia’s defensiveness and its resulting
      commitments. The Ukraine war starkly illustrates both the decline and the costly
      delusions it fosters.


      The United States and Europe seriously underestimated what Russia could and would
      do to prevail militarily in Ukraine. Russia’s victory—at least so far after two
      years of war—has proven decisive. Their underestimation stemmed from a shared
      inability to grasp or absorb the changing world economy and its implications.
      By mostly minimizing, marginalizing, or simply denying the decline of the U.S.
      empire relative to the rise of China and its BRICS allies, the United States and
      Europe missed that decline’s unfolding implications. Russia’s allies’ support,
      combined with its national determination to defend itself, has so far defeated
      a Ukraine heavily funded and armed by the collective West. Historically, declining
      empires often provoke denials and delusions that teach their people “hard lessons”
      and impose on them “hard choices”. That is where we are now.


      The economics of the U.S. empire''s decline constitute the continuing global context.
      The BRICS countries’ collective GDP, wealth, income, share of world trade, and
      presence at the highest levels of new technology increasingly exceed those of
      the G7. That relentless economic development frames the decline of the G7’s political
      and cultural influences as well. The massive U.S. and European sanctions program
      against Russia after February 2022 has failed. Russia turned especially to its
      BRICS allies to quickly and comprehensively escape most of those sanctions’ intended
      effects.


      Much of the rest of the world’s nations—a possible “world majority” of the planet’s
      people—are pulling away from the U.S. empire.


      UN votes on the ceasefire issue in Gaza reflect and reinforce the mounting difficulties
      facing the U.S. position in the Middle East and globally. So does the Houthis’
      intervention in Red Sea shipping, and so too will other future Arab and Islamic
      initiatives supporting Palestine against Israel. Among the consequences flowing
      from the changing world economy, many work to undermine and weaken the U.S. empire.


      Trump’s disrespect for NATO is partly an expression of disappointment with an
      institution he can blame for failing to stop empire’s decline. Trump and his supporters
      broadly downgrade many institutions once thought crucially central to running
      the U.S. empire globally. Both the Trump and Biden regimes attacked China’s Huawei
      corporation, shared commitments to trade and tariff wars, and heavily subsidized
      and competitively challenged U.S. corporations. Nothing less than a historic shift
      away from neoliberal globalization toward economic nationalism is underway. An
      American empire that once targeted the whole world is shrinking into a merely
      regional bloc, confronting one or more emerging regional blocs. Much of the rest
      of the world’s nations—a possible “world majority” of the planet’s people—are
      pulling away from the U.S. empire.


      U.S. leaders’ aggressive economic nationalist policies distract attention from
      the empire’s decline and thereby facilitate its denial. Yet they also cause new
      problems. Allies fear that economic nationalism in the United States already has
      or will soon adversely affect their economic relations with the United States;
      “America first” targets not only the Chinese. Many countries are rethinking and
      reconstructing their economic relations with the United States and their expectations
      about those relations’ futures. Likewise, major groups of U.S. employers are reconsidering
      their investment strategies. Those who invested heavily overseas as part of the
      neoliberal globalization frenzies of the last half century are especially fearful.
      They anticipate costs and losses from policy shifts toward economic nationalism.
      Their pushback slows those shifts. As capitalists everywhere adjust practically
      to the changing world economy, they also quarrel and dispute the direction and
      pace of change. That injects more uncertainty and volatility into a thereby further
      destabilized world economy. As the U.S. empire unravels, the world economic order
      it once dominated and enforced likewise changes.


      “Make America Great Again” (MAGA) slogans have politically weaponized U.S. empire’s
      decline, always in carefully vague and general terms. They simplify and misunderstand
      it within another set of delusions. Trump will, he promises repeatedly, undo that
      decline and reverse it. He will punish those he blames for it: China, but also
      Democrats, liberals, globalists, socialists, and Marxists whom he lumps together
      in a bloc-building strategy. There is rarely any serious attention to the economics
      of the G7’s decline since to do so would critically implicate capitalists’ profit-driven
      decisions as key causes of the decline. Neither Republicans nor Democrats dare
      do that. Biden speaks and acts as if the U.S. wealth and power positions within
      the world economy were undiminished from what they were across the second half
      of the 20th century (most of Biden’s political lifetime).


      Continuing to fund and arm Ukraine in the war with Russia, like endorsing and
      supporting Israel’s treatment of Palestinians, are policies premised on denials
      of a changed world.


      Continuing to fund and arm Ukraine in the war with Russia, like endorsing and
      supporting Israel’s treatment of Palestinians, are policies premised on denials
      of a changed world. So too are successive waves of economic sanctions despite
      each wave failing to achieve its goals. Using tariffs to keep better, cheaper
      Chinese electric vehicles off the U.S. market will only disadvantage U.S. individuals
      (via such Chinese electric vehicles’ higher prices) and businesses (via global
      competition from businesses buying the cheaper Chinese cars and trucks).


      Perhaps the greatest, costliest delusions that follow from a denial of years of
      decline dog the upcoming presidential election. The two major parties and their
      candidates offer no serious plan for how to deal with the declining empire they
      seek to lead. Both parties took turns presiding over the decline, yet denial and
      blaming the other is all either party offers in 2024. Biden offers voters a partnership
      in denial that the empire is declining. Trump promises vaguely to undo the decline
      caused by bad Democratic leadership that his election will remove. Nothing either
      major party does entails sober admissions and assessments of a changed world economy
      and how each plans to cope with that.


      The last 40 to 50 years of the economic history of the G7 witnessed extreme redistributions
      of wealth and income upward. Those redistributions functioned as both causes and
      effects of neoliberal globalization. However, domestic reactions (economic and
      social divisions increasingly hostile and volatile) and foreign reactions (emergence
      of today’s China and BRICS) are undermining neoliberal globalization and beginning
      to challenge its accompanying inequalities. U.S. capitalism and its empire cannot
      yet face its decline amid a changing world. Delusions about retaining or regaining
      power at the top of society proliferate alongside delusional conspiracy theories
      and political scapegoating (immigrants, China, Russia) below.


      Meanwhile, the economic, political, and cultural costs mount. And on some level,
      as per Leonard Cohen’s famous song, “Everybody Knows.”

  - title: A Class Analysis of the Biden-Trump Rematch
    url: https://www.laprogressive.com/author/richard-d-wolff/economic-equality/biden-trump-rematch
    text: 'By “class system,” we mean the basic workplace organizations—the human relationships
      or “social relations”—that accomplish the production and distribution of goods
      and services. Some examples include the master/slave, communal village, and lord/serf
      organizations. Another example, the distinctive capitalist class system, entails
      the employer/employee organization. In the United States and in much of the world,
      it is now the dominant class system. Employers—a tiny minority of the population—direct
      and control the enterprises and employees that produce and distribute goods and
      services. Employers buy the labor power of employees—the population’s vast majority—and
      set it to work in their enterprises. Each enterprise’s output belongs to its employer,
      who decides whether to sell it, sets the price, and receives and distributes the
      resulting revenue.


      In the United States, the employee class is badly split ideologically and politically.
      Most employees have probably stayed connected—with declining enthusiasm or commitment—to
      the Democratic Party. A sizable and growing minority within the class has some
      hope in Trump. Many have lost interest and participated less in electoral politics.
      Perhaps the most splintered are various “progressive” or “left” employees: some
      in the progressive wing of the Democratic Party, some in various socialist, Green,
      independent, and related small parties, and some even drawn hesitatingly to Trump.
      Left-leaning employees were perhaps more likely to join and activate social movements
      (ecological, anti-racist, anti-sexist, and anti-war) rather than electoral campaigns.


      The U.S. employee class broadly feels victimized by the last half-century’s neoliberal
      globalization. Waves of manufacturing (and also service) job exports, coupled
      with waves of automation (computers, robots, and now artificial intelligence),
      have mostly brought that class bad news. Loss of jobs, income, and job security,
      diminished future work prospects, and reduced social standing are chief among
      them. In contrast, the extraordinary profits that drove employers’ export and
      technology decisions accrued to them. Resulting redistributions of wealth and
      income likewise favored employers. Employees increasingly watched and felt a parallel
      social redistribution of political power and cultural riches moving beyond their
      reach.


      The post-1945 development of U.S. capitalism smashed the extraordinary employee
      class unity that had been formed during the Great Depression of the 1930s.


      Employees’ class feelings were well grounded in U.S. history. The post-1945 development
      of U.S. capitalism smashed the extraordinary employee class unity that had been
      formed during the Great Depression of the 1930s. After the 1929 economic crash
      and the 1932 election, a reform-minded “New Deal” coalition of labor union leaders
      and strong socialist and communist parties gathered supportively around the Franklin
      D. Roosevelt administration that governed until 1945. That coalition won huge,
      historically unprecedented gains for the employee class including Social Security,
      unemployment compensation, the first federal minimum wage, and a large public
      jobs program. It built an immense following for the Democratic Party in the employee
      class.


      As World War II ended in 1945, every other major capitalist economy (the UK, Germany,
      Japan, France, and Russia) was badly damaged. In sharp contrast, the war had strengthened
      U.S. capitalism. It reconstructed global capitalism and centered it around U.S.
      exports, capital investments, and the dollar as world currency. A new, distinctly
      American empire emerged, stressing informal imperialism, or “neo-colonialism,”
      against the formal, older imperialisms of Europe and Japan. The United States
      secured its new empire with an unprecedented global military program and presence.
      Private investment plus government spending on both the military and popular public
      services marked a transition from the Depression and war (with its rationing of
      consumer goods) to a dramatically different relative prosperity from the later
      1940s to the 1970s.


      Cold War ideology clothed post-1945 policies at home and abroad. Thus the government’s
      mission globally was to spread democracy and defeat godless socialism. That mission
      justified both increasingly heavy military spending and McCarthyism’s effective
      destruction of socialist, communist, and labor organizations. The Cold War atmosphere
      facilitated undoing and then reversing the Great Depression’s leftward surge of
      U.S. politics. Purging the left within unions plus the relentless demonization
      of left parties and social movements as foreign-based communist projects split
      the New Deal coalition. It separated left organizations from social movements
      and both of them from the employee class as a whole.


      Despite many employees staying loyal to the Democratic Party (even as they disconnected
      from the persecuted left components of the New Deal), the Cold War pushed all
      U.S. politics rightward. The Republican Party cashed in by being aggressively
      pro-Cold War and raising funds from employers determined to undo the New Deal.
      The Democratic Party leadership reduced its former reliance on weakening unions
      and the demoralized, deactivated remnants of the New Deal coalition. Instead that
      leadership sought funds from the same corporate rich that the Republicans tapped.
      The predictable results included the failure of the Democratic Party to reverse
      the rightward shift of U.S. politics. The Dems likewise abandoned most efforts
      to build on the achievements of the New Deal or move further toward social democracy.
      They increasingly failed even to protect what the New Deal had achieved. These
      developments deepened the alienation of many workers from the Democratic Party
      or political engagement altogether. A vicious downward cycle, with occasional
      temporary upsurge moments, took over “progressive” politics.


      That vicious cycle entrapped especially older, white males. Among employees, they
      had gained the most from the 1945-1975 prosperity. However, after the 1970s, employers’
      profit-driven automation and their decisions to relocate production abroad seriously
      undermined their employees’ jobs and incomes, especially in manufacturing. This
      part of the employee class eventually turned against “the system”—against the
      prevailing economic tide. They mourned a disappearing prosperity. At first, they
      turned right politically. The Cold War had isolated and undermined the left-wing
      institutions and culture that might otherwise have attracted anti-system employees.
      Left-leaning mobilizations against the system as a whole were rare (unlike more
      single-issue mobilizations around issues like gender, race, and ecology). Neither
      unions nor other organizations had the social support needed to organize them.
      Or they simply feared to try. Even more recently the rising labor and union militancy
      has so far only secondarily and marginally raised themes of systematic anti-capitalism.


      Republican politicians and media personalities seized the opportunity to transform
      the disappearing post-1970s prosperity into an idealized American past. They carefully
      avoided blaming that disappearance on profit-driven capitalism. They blamed Democrats
      and “liberals” whose social welfare programs cost too much. Excessive taxes were
      wasted, they insisted, on ineffective social programs for “others” (the non-white
      and non-male). If only those others worked as hard and as productively as white
      males did, Republicans repeated, they would have enjoyed the same prosperity instead
      of seeking a “free ride from the government.” Portions of the employee class persuaded
      by such reasoning switched from Democrat to Republican and then often responded
      to Trump’s “Make America Great Again” (MAGA) mantra. Their switch stimulated Republican
      politicians to imagine a possible new mass base much broader than their existing
      mix of religious fundamentalists, gun lovers, and white supremacists. Leading
      Republicans glimpsed political possibilities unavailable since the Great Depression
      of the 1930s had turned U.S. politics leftward toward social democracy.


      Emerging from within or around the Republican Party, the new 21st-century far
      Right revived classic U.S. isolationist patriotism around America First slogans.
      They combined that with a loosely libertarian blaming of all social ills on the
      inherent evil of government. By carefully directing neither criticism nor blame
      toward the capitalist economic system, Republicans secured the usual support (financial,
      political, journalistic) from the employer class. That included employers who
      had never prospered much from the neoliberal globalization turn, those who saw
      bigger, better opportunities from an economic nationalist/protectionist turn,
      and all those long focused on the employer-driven project of undoing the New Deal
      politically, culturally, and economically. These various elements increasingly
      gathered around Trump.


      They opposed immigration, often via hysterical statements and mobilizations against
      “invasions” fantasized as threatening America. They defined government spending
      on immigrants (using native and “hard-working” Americans’ taxes) as wasted on
      unmeritorious “others.” Trump championed their views and reinforced parallel scapegoating
      of Black and Brown citizens and women as unworthy beneficiaries of government
      supports exchanged for their voting Democratic. Some Republicans increasingly
      embraced conspiracy theories (QAnon and others) to explain diverse plots aimed
      at dethroning white Christianity from dominating American society. MAGA and America
      First are slogans that articulate resentment, bitterness, and protest at perceived
      victimization. Repurposing Cold War imagery, Trumpers synonymously targeted liberals,
      Democrats, Marxists, socialists, labor unions, and others seen as close allies
      plotting to “replace” white Christians. Trump referred to them publicly as “vermin”
      that he would defeat/destroy once he became President again.


      The larger part of the U.S. employee class has not (yet) been won over by the
      Republicans. It has stayed, so far, with the Democrats. Yet aggravated social
      divisiveness has settled everywhere into U.S. culture and politics. It frightens
      many who stay within the Democratic Party, seeing it as the lesser evil despite
      its “centrist” leaders and their corporate donors. The latter include especially
      the financial and hi-tech megacorporations that profitably led the post-1975 neoliberal
      globalization period. The centrist leadership studiously avoided offending its
      corporate patrons while using a modified Keynesian fiscal policy to achieve two
      objectives. The first was support for government programs that helped solidify
      an electoral base increasingly among women, and Black and brown citizens. The
      second was support for aggressively projecting U.S. military and political power
      around the world.


      The U.S. empire protected by that policy proved especially profitable for the
      financial and hi-tech circles of the United States’ biggest businesses. At the
      same time, another part of the U.S. employee class also began to turn against
      the system, but it found the new Right unacceptable and “centrism” only slightly
      less so. The Democratic Party has so far retained most of these people, although
      many have increasingly moved toward “progressive” champions such as Bernie Sanders,
      Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez, and Cori Bush. Cornel West and Jill Stein carry similar
      banners into this year’s election, but they insist on doing that from outside
      the Democratic Party.


      Hostility has intensified between the two major parties as their opposition has
      become more extreme. This keeps happening because neither found nor implemented
      any solutions to the deepening problems besetting the United States. Ever more
      extreme wealth and income inequalities undermine what remains of a sense of community
      binding Americans. Politics ever more controlled by the employer class and especially
      the super-rich produce widespread debilitating anger, resignation, and rage. The
      relatively shrinking power of the United States abroad drives home a sense of
      impending doom. The rise of the first real economic superpower competitor (China)
      raises the specter of the U.S. global unipolar moment being replaced, and soon.


      Each major party blames the other for everything going wrong. Both also respond
      to the declining empire by moving rightward toward alternative versions of economic
      nationalism—“America First”—in place of the cheerleading for neoliberal globalization
      that both parties indulged in before. Republicans carefully refuse to blame capitalism
      or capitalists for anything. Instead, they blame bad government, the Democrats,
      the liberals, and China. Democrats likewise carefully refuse to blame capitalism
      or capitalists for anything (except the “progressives,” who do that moderately).
      Democrats mostly blame Republicans who have “gone crazy” and “threaten democracy.”
      They erect new versions of their old demons. Russia and Putin stand in for the
      USSR and Stalin as chief awful foreigners with Chinese “communists” a close second.
      Trying to hold on to the political middle, the Democrats denounce Republicans
      and especially the Trump/MAGA people for challenging the last 70 years of political
      consensus. In that Democratic Party version of the “good old days,” reasonable
      Republicans and Democrats then alternated in power dutifully. The result was that
      the U.S. empire and U.S. capitalism prospered first by helping to end the exhausted
      European empires and then by profiting from the United States’ unipolar global
      hegemony.


      Biden’s plans pretend the U.S. empire is not in decline. In 2024, he offers more
      of the old establishment politics. Trump basically pretends the same about the
      U.S. empire but carefully selects problem areas (e.g., immigration, Chinese competition,
      and Ukraine) that he can represent as failures of Democratic leadership. Nothing
      fundamental is amiss with the U.S. empire and its prospects in his eyes. All that
      is necessary is to reject Biden and his politics as incapable of reviving it.
      Trump’s plans thus call for a much more extreme economic nationalism run by a
      leaner, meaner government.


      Each side deepens the split between Republicans and Democrats. Neither dares admit
      the basic, long-term declining empire and the key problems (income and wealth
      inequality, politics corrupted by that inequality, worsening business cycles,
      and mammoth debts) accumulated by its capitalist foundation. The parties’ jousting
      turns on substitute issues that offer temporary electoral advantages. It also
      reinforces the public’s incapacity for systemic critique and change. Both parties
      endlessly appeal to a population whose alienation deepens as relentless systemic
      decline worms its way into everyone’s daily life and troubles. Both parties increasingly
      expose their growing irrelevance.


      Neither party’s campaign offers solutions to systemic decline. Gross miscalculations
      of a changed world economy and shrinking U.S. political power abroad underlay
      both parties’ failed policies in relation to Afghanistan, Iraq, Ukraine, and Gaza.
      The turn toward economic nationalism and protectionism will not stop the decline.
      Something bigger and deeper than either Party dares consider is underway. Capitalism
      has moved its dynamic centers yet again over the last generation. This time the
      move went from western Europe, North America, and Japan to China, India, and beyond,
      from the G7 to BRICS. Wealth and power are correspondingly shifting.


      The places capitalism leaves behind descend into mass depression, overdose deaths,
      and sharpening social divisions. These social crises keep worsening alongside
      deepening inequalities of wealth, income, and education. Steadily, if also maddeningly
      slowly, the rightward shift of U.S. politics after 1945 has finally arrived at
      social exhaustion and ineffectuality. Perhaps thereby the United States prepares
      another possible New Deal with or without another 1929-style crash.


      Hopefully, then, one crucial lesson of the New Deal will have been learned and
      applied. Leaving the capitalist class structure of production unchanged—a minority
      of employers dominating a majority of employees—enables that minority to undo
      whatever reforms any New Deal might achieve. That is what the U.S. employer class
      did after 1945. The solution now must include moving beyond the employer-employee
      organization of the workplace. Replacing that with a democratic community organization—what
      we elsewhere call worker cooperatives—is the missing element that can make progressive
      reforms stick. When employees and employers are the same people, no longer will
      a separate employer class have the incentive and resources to undo what the employee
      majority wants.


      Replacing employer/employee-organized workplaces with worker coops is the very
      different “great replacement” we need. On the basis of reforms secured in that
      way, we can build a future. We can avoid repeating the last half-century’s failure
      even to preserve the reforms imposed on a capitalism that crashed and burned in
      the 1930s.

    paragraph_summary: The article discusses the evolution of class systems in the workplace,
      particularly focusing on the capitalist employer/employee structure that dominates
      the U.S. economy today. It outlines how this system has led to significant ideological
      and political fragmentation among employees, many of whom feel victimized by neoliberal
      globalization, job losses, and diminishing social standing. The historical context
      highlights the unity of the employee class during the New Deal era, which was
      subsequently dismantled by post-1945 capitalist policies and the Cold War's ideological
      shifts. This fragmentation has contributed to the rise of right-wing populism,
      exemplified by figures like Trump, who capitalize on discontent without addressing
      the underlying capitalist structures. The article argues that both major political
      parties fail to confront systemic issues like wealth inequality and the decline
      of U.S. global power, instead perpetuating a cycle of alienation and ineffective
      governance. It concludes by advocating for a shift towards worker cooperatives
      as a means to democratize the workplace and create sustainable reforms that empower
      employees rather than a minority of employers.

  - title: When University "Leaders" Order Police to Crush Student Protests
    url: https://www.laprogressive.com/author/richard-d-wolff/education-reform/crush-student-protests
    text: 'The Washington Post’s journalists recently exposed what many already suspected
      or knew. Donors from society’s richest 1 percent pressured university administrators
      and political leaders to use police and other means to crush peaceful student
      protests. The students wanted a change in United States and Israeli policy and
      action to secure an immediate ceasefire in Gaza. Growing numbers of faculty are
      joining the students’ protests. They too have been unjustly persecuted by the
      same “authorities.”


      Of course, the lawful role U.S. police are supposed to play is quite different.
      As “peacekeepers” police should act to make it safe for any and all sides of disputes
      over U.S. foreign (or domestic) policies to engage in free speech. When university
      leaders collaborate with police to shut down free speech, both abuse their power.
      Students around the world have confronted those abuses as have U.S. students in
      the past. Our students now confront them yet again.


      As a professor myself, I am embarrassed when university administrators justify
      calling in the police to “remove” students from university “private property”
      (such as lawns). They argue as if real estate concerns outweighed the education
      and public importance entailed by peaceful student protests on urgent, life-and-death
      public issues of the day. Real estate justifications also reveal university administrators’
      ignorance. Huge tax exemptions subsidize private universities in the United States
      with public money. They get expensive public services delivered to them gratis.
      The rest of the U.S. public pays the taxes that fund those public services. Likewise,
      massive government grants support general university purposes (added on to grants
      for specific academic research projects) for both “private” and public institutions.
      To significant degrees, all colleges and universities are publicly funded institutions.
      They are thus perfectly appropriate locations for public expressions of opinion
      about important public issues. University administrators try to hide slavish pandering
      to rich donors when they try fake “private property” excuses for calling the police
      on students. Punishing students seeking peace in Gaza brings deep and lasting
      shame on the universities who do that.


      The same applies to all those authorities who use the old “violence” ploy to cover
      their pandering. They pose as driven to prevent or end mostly unreal campus violence.
      Meanwhile, these same authorities mostly support real, infinitely worse violence
      in Ukraine and Gaza. In contrast, student protestors for peace in Gaza have every
      reason to avoid campus violence precisely because it risks dissuading some other
      students from joining them. Enemies of the protest try to associate it with violence
      precisely to constrain the protests’ growth. Years ago, university administrators,
      police, and politicians likewise wildly exaggerated the minimal violence they
      blamed on anti-Vietnam war protesters. Unlike those authorities, those protesters
      actually helped end that war and its horrific violence.


      Protests disrupt “business as usual” to open time and space for public discussion
      and action around an urgent public issue. That is why workers strike, marchers
      crowd streets for the rights of minorities and women, and vigils for peace gather
      at traffic intersections. In recent years, millions of French people wearing yellow
      vests shut down France to ask for social changes. In the spring of 2024, general
      strikers similarly shut down Argentina. Protesters explain why they want change.
      Their protests ask others to engage with the question of change.


      Protests also attest to a society’s social health: its ability to overcome the
      resignation, reticence, and fear that too often prevent or delay social problems
      from getting public attention. The absence of protest often drives urgent social
      problems underground. There they fester and eventually burst forth more disruptively
      than earlier protests would have been. Let protesters make their points. If counter-protesters
      wish, let them do likewise with their points. That is what “free speech” means.
      When the “authorities” in power fear the criticism, questions, and demands of
      the people they control, almost any public protests quickly become intolerably
      frightening to them. Their control is challenged and they react in ways that undercut
      their empty claims to be “democratic.” We all have a right and duty to affirm
      genuine free speech.


      The larger world is changing. The horrors in Gaza, the forming of a new, powerful
      student movement critical of U.S. foreign policy, and undemocratic efforts to
      stop free speech all flow from global changes. Our world is now fast becoming
      very different from what it was for most of our parents’ lives. Just as the British
      empire rose, peaked, and then fell, the American empire that followed it rose,
      peaked, and is now declining. Americans are only beginning to grasp that reality
      as denying it remains the majority’s position. Each of us confronts the changes
      in the world based on our own histories. Therefore, before drawing conclusions
      about Gaza and the student protests, I need to explain where I am coming from,
      my family’s history, and how it contextualizes my engagement with a changed and
      changing world.


      My mother and her sister were both incarcerated in concentration camps in the
      late 1930s (my aunt in a German camp, my mother in a French camp). Their parents
      (my grandparents) were killed in a different German concentration camp. My mother
      was born and raised in Berlin, Germany, and attended the University of Berlin
      until she fled Germany in 1936. My father, born in Metz (a disputed French/German
      city on the border), attended several German and Swiss universities, became a
      lawyer and eventually a judge in Germany before leaving for France in 1933. His
      sister was picked up by the Gestapo in Paris in the late 1930s and later killed
      in Auschwitz. Many other family members died in ways linked to fascism and/or
      World War II. All those who “survived” suffered severe traumas, often aggravations
      of other traumas they had suffered earlier in their lives.


      My parents, beyond surviving, additionally underwent the refugee experience in
      the United States. The English language and U.S. customs were largely unknown
      to them. They had no money. Their European professional credentials were not honored
      in the United States. When I was born, my father was a steel worker in a Youngstown,
      Ohio, factory, and my mother was a “homemaker” in that period’s words. As the
      first child of refugee “survivors” of multiple traumas, I was heavily pressured
      to “succeed” in the new country. My unspoken task was somehow to compensate for
      all the losses and injuries my parents always carried with them everywhere. I
      also listened closely to the snippets of information about fascism, Europe, World
      War II, and contemporary history that emerged from countless conversations in
      and around my family. This is the background for how I “relate” to the events
      in Israel, Gaza, and the United States over recent decades, especially since last
      October. “Relate” here includes confronting today’s student protests, their attempted
      repression, and writing this article.


      The uniform premise of discussions of fascism, war, and related subjects within
      my family was that they all represented the most recent of a long list of human
      tragedies across history. They could have happened anywhere and probably did.
      And they could happen and probably would happen again anywhere. Perhaps the best
      that we could reasonably hope for was that some sort of political action we might
      undertake now could reduce the probability, frequency, or horrors of future tragedies.


      For me, that meant I should seek to understand how societies work, act to change
      them, and thereby contribute to achieving the best that could reasonably be hoped
      for. Notions that any nation or region was uniquely prone to or immune from becoming
      Nazis were not taken seriously. Germany was in no way uniquely prone to nazification.
      Likewise, “denazification laws,” “civil liberty traditions,” or slogans like “never
      again” gave no nation immunity from becoming partly or wholly nazified. That included
      Israel.


      My father fought fascism as a student in Germany, then as a journalist across
      Europe, as a labor lawyer in Germany, and later as a naturalized U.S. citizen
      combatting the racism directed against African Americans and against Puerto Rican
      immigrants in New York City. He was respectful of Marxism as an intellectual tradition
      and a political movement but personally kept his distance from it. He was always
      a European left social democrat: comfortable in the United States of Franklin
      Delano Roosevelt (FDR) from his arrival in 1939 until FDR’s death in 1945. He
      became progressively more uncomfortable after 1945. He neither missed nor denied
      the rightward shifts of politics in the United States and Western Europe after
      1945. He sensed the maturation of conditions that could again enable new nazisms
      to emerge. He explicitly wondered about such possibilities, especially for a fascism
      to emerge and take power in the United States but also in other places including
      Israel.


      As my mother grew older, she mused often that “the Jews learned nothing from the
      Holocaust” and “the Jewish Zionists learned nothing from the Holocaust beyond
      ‘Better to perpetrate one than to suffer it again’.” My mother, 9 years younger
      than my father, had to leave the University of Berlin in 1936 after police identified
      her as a courier for the anti-Hitler underground. A frequently heard comment from
      one or the other of my parents: Jews have very often been the enemies and victims
      of nationalisms, often after long periods of living and intermarrying in neighborhoods
      where Jews and non-Jews comingled peacefully. What drove non-Jews to turn on Jewish
      neighbors were worsening economic and social problems affecting both Jewish and
      non-Jewish communities. In both communities, few identified the sources of their
      problems as capitalism, imperialism, and colonialism: the taboos against such
      reasoning were too strong.


      There were still too few Marxists to teach and explain the effects of capitalism.
      The Marxists and their allies that were active then analyzed social problems in
      ways and using terms heavily influenced by the Russian Revolution and the specific
      interpretation of Marxism promoted by the USSR. That interpretation became dominant
      over other, alternative interpretations because the unrivaled prestige of the
      first and only successful Marxist revolution in 1917 Russia made its interpretation
      dominant. Soviet Marxism defined capitalism as an economic system that combined
      private property (privately owned and operated enterprises) with free markets
      (enterprises and workers distributing goods and services to one another via exchange).
      Soviet Marxists and those who followed their lead argued that the capitalist system
      produced the inequalities of wealth and income, the instabilities of the “business
      cycle,” and the corruptions of politics by money that all together could lead
      to fascism and Nazis. In contrast, socialists proposed to advance beyond capitalism
      via (1) seizure of the state by the working class (by revolution or ballot victories),
      (2) state takeovers of enterprises, and (3) state planning instead of markets.
      They called such a socialism a rational economic system working in the interests
      of the majority working class rather than a minority capitalist class of owners.
      Such a socialism was the opposite, the antidote for, and the alternative to fascism.


      Meanwhile, the emerging Nazis analyzed society by focusing on altogether different
      concepts such as race and nation. They defined the social problem as national
      and racial in origin: the German nation/Aryan race was being victimized by the
      Jewish nation/race. My father quoted Engels to the effect that such antisemitism
      was the stupid person’s socialism.


      How had Germans in fact suffered (or, in Nazi terms, been victimized)? In and
      by the loss of World War I (1918), the huge reparations bill charged to Germany
      afterward, the worst inflation in modern European history that devastated its
      middle classes’ savings (1923), and then the Great Crash (1929) and its global
      Depression aftermath. German capitalists and the right-wing parties they funded
      took political advantage of all those events by deeming them victimizations. They
      blamed non-Germans for them: Bolsheviks from whom German socialists and communists
      had imported their evil ideologies. Nazis stressed the presence of Jews in the
      German left as their basis to rewrite history as a conspiracy to subordinate Germans
      (and others) to Jewish global financial rule. That project drew much inspiration
      from earlier writings across Europe accompanying antisemitic upsurges there. Casting
      Jews as thus a threatening race/nation, Nazis could mobilize Germans for their
      self-defense against the Jewish threat. Self-defense could and did justify repression,
      property dispossession, arrest, and eventually physical extermination of Jews.
      Similarly now for many Israelis, the war on Gaza is justified as an exercise in
      defense against Palestinians and the deep threat they are seen to represent. Aggressive
      U.S. foreign policies likewise refer to their military arm as the Department of
      Defense.


      Germany’s extreme problems after World War I culminating in the impact of the
      global Great Depression after 1929 overwhelmed its leaders. They found no traditional
      way forward as the mass of Germans became ever more desperate. Therefore they
      accepted the way offered by Hitler. His genocidal tendencies found a fertile ground
      that led to scapegoating especially of Jews. The Nazis filled the jails, concentration
      camps, and eventually the ovens and graves of Germany and many of its allies (Poland,
      Austria, Italy, Spain, and occupied France) with all their scapegoats.


      There was always opposition to Nazism. Alongside the Jewish opposition, there
      were also many others, especially among socialists and communists. Those oppositions
      suffered countless tragic losses but also proved spectacularly productive of heroic
      and productive breakthroughs in thought, association, and action. Those breakthroughs
      shaped world history after 1945. They helped to make us the critics of received
      norms of racial, gender, and class discrimination. In particular, they strengthened
      and transformed post-war anti-imperialism and anti-capitalism. Most colonialisms
      were overthrown by the colonized.


      My parents’ and their families’ traumas generated among the survivors a certain
      sympathy and empathy for the idea that Jews (and also LGBTQ+ people, the Roma,
      and others persecuted by Nazis) might finally and somehow find safety in the world.
      That extended to a romanticized early image of Israel—and especially its kibbutzim
      collectivities. But starting in the 1950s, as the kibbutzim declined and Israeli
      governments accepted ever more subordination to U.S. foreign policies, my parents’
      sympathies diminished.


      Qua religion, Judaism had been long abandoned not only by my mother and father
      but also by their parents. Those generations were proudly “free-thinkers” or what
      my father once called “post-religion.” Holding on to religious symbols and rituals
      at a time when they seemed ever more inappropriate, absurd, or worse struck them
      as unwanted modes of separation from the progressive tendencies of the larger
      society. Both my sister and I grew up and shared in that framework as have my
      children.


      The previous paragraphs sketch some context for how I approach the Israeli-Palestine
      conflict and U.S. student protests. The Israelis and Palestinians are trapped
      in a dead-end. Different as it is in most details from Germany in the 1930s, the
      Palestine-Israel conflict is similarly driven toward ever more deeply irrational
      objectives and strategies. For safety, some Jewish Zionists undertook a 20th-century
      settler colonialism in Palestine similar to what the British, French, German,
      and other European nations had undertaken in earlier centuries. Back then it was
      possible to “succeed” in military, political, and ideological terms in establishing
      and profiting from such settler colonialisms for long periods. There were centuries
      of time to ethnically cleanse indigenous people, to enable invading settler colonists
      to herd them into areas “reserved” for their impoverishment. Israel’s is the attempt
      much, much later to establish and secure a settler colonialism in radically altered
      historical conditions. Now most of the world’s people fight for and celebrate
      freedom from (ending) settler and other colonialisms. Their opposition offsets
      and now threatens to overwhelm the immense support Israel received and receives
      from the US and its shrinking number of other supporters.


      Colonial subjects always resisted and fought back against the colonizers. Resistance
      repressed went and grew underground. Periodically then it exploded into view surprising
      the colonizers with its ever deeper roots, persistence, and intensities. Eventually
      and everywhere, resistance to colonialism developed the self-consciousness, theories,
      organizations, and weaponry to overcome colonialism at least to the point of acquiring
      formal political independence. My own PhD dissertation sought to identify the
      roots overdetermining this process in Britain’s settler colonialism in Kenya.
      There, accumulated resistances and repressions peaked in the Mau Mau rebellion.
      It freed Kenya’s people by ending Kenya’s colonial status. Acquiring real political
      independence is the next step now engaging many formerly colonized territories.
      Real economic independence—as required by real freedom—is yet a further step now
      gingerly explored by China, India, and Brazil.


      Colonial history thus suggests the poorest of prospects for Israeli settler colonialism
      prevailing over a colonized Palestine. The conditions of existence for any such
      prevalence are not there now nor likely to emerge. Israel’s history thus displays
      repeated Palestinian uprisings and repeated Israeli repressions. Both become increasingly
      violent and vindictive. Stuck in a dead end, resistors and repressors resort to
      ever more extreme actions such as Hamas’s attack last October and Israel’s destruction
      of Gaza ever since. Israeli officials refer to Palestinians as “animals” and speak
      publicly about expelling millions of them from the country. Palestinian officials
      insist a genocide is being imposed by Israel upon them. Netanyahu’s allies join
      in banning and arresting opponents of his policies. How much further along that
      road will they go? U.S. students in response have given birth to a new mass movement
      that is changing the country as you read this.


      Hitler’s genocide ended when outside forces intervened to fight and win World
      War II. Inside forces (Jewish resistance, resistance to German occupation, and
      anti-fascism) helped in key ways. Will the forces already inside Israel and Palestine
      together with outside forces intervene and stop the Palestine-Israel catastrophe?
      Students and faculties at colleges and universities across the world are now in
      the movement for such interventions. Each of them is now making personal choices
      about whether and how to participate in that movement. Each person’s choice will
      affect the rest of that person’s life.


      Many students and teachers are at work trying to understand honestly how Palestinian
      and Israeli societies evolved, separately and in relation, such that they came
      to today’s horrific situation. They use classes, readings, and libraries seriously
      to interrogate concepts like “settler colonialism,” “apartheid,” “self-defense,”
      and “antisemitism/anti-Zionism.”


      Many students and teachers proceed unafraid to ask about how capitalism may have
      operated on both the Israeli and Palestinian sides—and among their supporters—in
      producing today’s dead end. The point of asking is to inquire further about an
      urgent issue: could basic social changes help overcome the Israeli-Palestine dead
      end by providing a new beginning on an economic foundation better than capitalism?
      Might the kibbutzim, had their numbers and importance within the Israeli economy
      been facilitated, have produced a different politics? Might the growth of worker
      cooperatives within the Palestinian territories have functioned likewise? Had
      such coops and kibbutzim built upon their shared economic structures to fashion
      political alliances, how differently might the whole Middle East have evolved?


      Yes, these are big, bold, new ways of thinking about the present, horrific dead-end
      in Gaza. Students and universities have often led the rest of society in such
      new ways. Yes, universities around the world now struggle with huge free-speech
      vs. police issues provoked by the Gaza events. But the old, defensive, aggressive
      ways of thinking and acting have more than failed to solve the Israeli-Palestine
      problem. They made it worse. Old defensive, aggressive ways of thinking also misunderstand
      a changed world, one in which the U.S. dominance coming out of World War II has
      now peaked and is receding. A declining empire is a new experience and context
      for everything else happening around us. Our generation is living through that
      process of decline. We need to think critically about historic dead ends without
      past generations’ fear of using anti-capitalist traditions of thought.


      The student and faculty protest movement around demands for a Gaza ceasefire is
      doing that. For that it deserves applause and to be joined. To the students now
      leading us I offer my gratitude.

  - title: 'Don’t Be Fooled: Tariffs Don’t Protect Jobs'
    url: https://www.laprogressive.com/author/richard-d-wolff/labor-social-justice/tariffs-dont-protect-jobs
    text: 'Both Trump and Biden imposed high tariffs on imported products made in China
      and other countries. Those impositions broke with and departed from the previous
      half century’s policies favoring “free trade” (less or minimal government intervention
      in international markets). Free trade policies facilitated “globalization,” the
      euphemism for the post-1970 surge in U.S. corporations’ investing abroad: producing
      and distributing there, re-locating operations there, and merging with foreign
      enterprises there. Presidents before Trump had insisted that free trade plus globalization
      best served U.S. interests. Both Democratic and Republican administrations had
      enthusiastically endorsed that insistence. Dutifully performing ideological support
      duties, they stressed how globalization’s benefits to U.S. corporations would
      “trickle down” to the rest of us. Globalizing U.S. corporations used portions
      of their profits to reward both parties with donations and other electoral and
      lobbying supports.


      Our last two Presidents reversed that position. Against free trade they favored
      multiple government interventions in international trade, especially imposing
      and raising tariffs. Instead of advocating free trade and globalization, they
      promoted economic nationalism. Like their predecessors, Trump and Biden depended
      on financial support from corporate America as well as votes from the employee
      class. Many U.S. corporations and those they enriched had shifted their profit
      expectations in response to the competition they faced from new, powerful non-U.S.
      firms. The latter had emerged during the free-trade/globalization conditions after
      1970, above all in China. U.S. firms increasingly welcomed or demanded protection
      from those competitors. Accordingly, they financed changes in the political winds
      and shifts in “public opinion” toward economic nationalism.


      Trump and Biden thus endorsed pro-tariff policies that protected many corporations’
      profits. Those policies also appealed to those for whom economic nationalism offered
      ideological comforts. For example, many in the United States grasped the relative
      decline of the United States and its G7 allies in the global economy and the relative
      rise of China and its BRICS allies. They welcomed an aggressive counteraction
      in the forms of tariff and trade wars. Both corporations (including mass media)
      and their subservient politicians worked to build popular and voter support. That
      was needed to pass the tax, budget, subsidy, tariff, and other laws that would
      realize the shift to economic nationalism. A key argument held that “tariffs protect
      jobs.” A political struggle pitted the defenders of “free trade” against those
      demanding “protection.” Over the last decade, those defenders have been losing.


      These days, most candidates and parties perform this particular ideological task
      for capitalism: persuading Americans that tariffs protect jobs. Note, however,
      that over the 50 years before around 2015, the same parties and their candidates
      mostly performed the opposite ideological task. Then they denounced tariffs as
      unnecessary, inefficient, and counterproductive government interferences. “Free
      international markets” would, they insisted, be much better for workers and capitalists.
      However, we need not and should not have been fooled then or now. Neither ideological
      claim is true.


      Free trade profits some industries, but not others. Those that profit rely on
      exporting their outputs to foreign markets, invest there, or rely on importing
      products from there. Similarly, tariffs profit some industries (those they protect),
      but not others. As industries evolve and change, so do their relationships with
      international trade. Correspondingly, their attitudes toward free trade versus
      tariffs change.


      Capitalist economies almost always pit pro-free trade against pro-tariff protection
      industries. Their battles vary from open, public, and intense to quiet and under-the-table.
      Their weapons include bribes, donations, and other kinds of deals offered to politicians
      mostly by the employers in the interested industries. Both sides also compete
      to enlist the public and especially voter support—“public opinion”—in order to
      swing politicians their way. Employers on each side spend millions to persuade
      the employee class to support their side. Politicians usually split according
      to which side offers more donations threatens more opposition in the next election,
      or has spent more to shape public opinion. Each side seeks to prevail, to make
      government policies favor free versus tariff-protected trade. One way to achieve
      that is endless repetition by politicians, business leaders, journalists, and
      academics of one side’s perspective in the hope and expectation that it becomes
      “common sense.”


      Each side’s arguments are driven by their respective industries’ financial self-interest,
      not any shared commitment to the “truth” about tariffs versus free trade. As we
      show below, the truth is precisely that neither tariffs nor their opposite, free
      trade, necessarily protect jobs. At best, both protect some jobs at the cost of
      losing others. The truth is that we cannot know—and thus cannot measure—all the
      effects on profits or jobs caused by either free trade or protectionism. So politicians
      cannot know what the net effect on jobs will be of either free or protected trade
      policies of governments.


      A simple example can clarify the basic points. Chinese auto-makers currently sell
      high-quality electric vehicles (EVs), cars, and trucks, globally, at very competitive
      prices. Those EVs can be found on roadways around the world, but not in the United
      States. That is because, until recently, a 27.5 percent tariff was applied in
      the United States. For example, if a Chinese EV’s port-of-entry price was, say,
      $30,000, it would cost a U.S. buyer $30,000 plus the 27.5 percent tariff (an additional
      $8,250) for a total U.S. price of $38,250. Recently, President Biden raised that
      tariff from 27.5 percent to 100 percent, thereby raising the Chinese EV’s price
      for potential U.S. buyers to $60,000. The EU plans similarly to raise its tariff
      against Chinese EVs from 10 percent to 48 percent, thereby raising the price to
      potential EU buyers to $44,400.


      Those tariffs protect makers of electric vehicles inside the U.S. and EU precisely
      because those EV makers need not add any tariff to the prices they charge. Thus,
      for example, if EVs made in the U.S. and EU had cost $40,000, they would have
      been uncompetitive with the Chinese EVs priced at $30,000. Prospects of profit
      for them would have been grim. With the tariffs now imposed by the U.S. and proposed
      by the EU, their EV makers see profit bonanzas. Makers in the EU can raise their
      EV price from $40,000 to, say, $43,000, and still be cheaper than Chinese EV imports
      suffering the planned EU tariff and thus priced at $44,400. EV makers in the U.S.
      can raise their prices to, say, $50,000, sharply improving their profits while
      still outcompeting Chinese EVs priced at $60,000 (including the 100 percent tariff).


      Barring interference from other factors (possible automation, changing tastes
      for cars, and so forth), we may assume that the raised tariffs increased the profits
      of EV makers inside the U.S. and EU. We may also assume that those tariffs also
      saved jobs at those U.S. EV makers. But that is never the end of the story. EV
      jobs are not the only jobs affected by raised tariffs on EVs.


      For example, many corporations in the United States buy fleets of EVs as inputs.
      Many compete with corporations outside the United States who likewise buy such
      fleets as their inputs. The raised U.S. tariff seriously disadvantages EV fleet-buying
      firms inside the United States. Firms inside the United States cannot buy Chinese
      electric vehicles for $30,000 each. They have to pay much more for the tariff-protected
      U.S.-made EVs. In stark contrast, their competitors outside the United States
      can buy Chinese EVs at the far cheaper $30,000 price. It follows that those outside
      competitors can offer lower prices for whatever products they sell because they
      enjoy lower (because free of tariffs) input costs. Those firms will gain buyers
      for their products around the world at the expense of their inside-the-U.S. competitors.


      Jobs will likely be lost in such competitively disadvantaged firms inside the
      United States. While raising tariffs on Chinese EVs may have protected U.S. workers
      at EV producers inside the United States, it also deprived other U.S. workers
      of jobs in other U.S. industries competitively disadvantaged by the EV tariff.


      In our examples above, U.S. and EU makers of EVs can and likely will raise their
      prices because of tariff protection. In this way, tariffs tend to worsen inflations.
      Inflations in turn tend to hurt exports as rising prices lead customers to buy
      elsewhere. Reduced exports usually mean reduced jobs making such exports.


      Still more factors shape tariffs’ job effects. Often “forgotten” by tariff boosters
      are possible retaliations by affected other countries. Evidence already suggests
      retaliatory Chinese tariffs coming on imports of U.S.-made large-engine vehicles.
      If that happens, U.S. exports of such engines to China will shrink or end. Jobs
      entailed in those exports will also end, offsetting job gains from the U.S. tariffs
      imposed on Chinese EVs.


      Since China is the chief target of U.S. and EU tariff policies it is important
      to see how China can retaliate in ways that threaten large U.S. and EU job losses.
      China has now successfully surrounded itself with allies in the BRICS (a total
      of 11 countries). The economic damage inflicted upon China by U.S. tariffs incentivizes
      China to offset much or all of that damage by shifting to sell output instead
      to the world outside of the United States and the EU and especially to its BRICS
      partners. As China redirects its exports, that will also impact where its imports
      will be sourced. All those changes will affect many U.S. and EU industries and
      the jobs they sustain.


      Honest economists shrug and plead irreducible uncertainty when asked whether tariffs
      will “protect” jobs. No matter how hard-pressed or bribed to give a definitive
      answer, honesty precludes it. Nonetheless, politicians eager to get votes by promising
      that a tariff they impose will protect jobs can rest easy. They will easily find
      economists who will give or sell them the answers they want to hear. Trump and
      Biden did and do.


      The implications of this analysis for the U.S. working class are significant.
      The struggle between free traders and protectionists pits shifting alliances of
      capitalist employers against one another. One alliance of capitalist employers
      fights another to win the working class’s votes. Each side promotes its false
      narrative about what is the best policy for jobs.


      The working class should not be fooled or distracted by these free trade versus
      protectionism struggles among capitalists. Whoever wins them remains profit-driven
      first and foremost. The ultimate impact on jobs is not a priority for any of them.
      It never was. The working class’s interest in shaping the quantity and quality
      of jobs can only be genuinely prioritized if society progresses beyond capitalism.
      That happens when employees (running democratic worker coops) replace employers
      (dominating hierarchical capitalist enterprises) in the driver seats of factories,
      offices, and stores. When employees have become their own employers, they will
      make the quantities and qualities of a society’s jobs a key policy objective rather
      than a side effect of policies focused elsewhere.

    one_sentence_summary: Both Trump and Biden shifted U.S. trade policy from free trade
      to economic nationalism by imposing high tariffs on imports, particularly from
      China, which has led to a complex interplay of job protection and loss across
      various industries, highlighting the nuanced and often counterproductive nature
      of tariffs in the global economy.
    paragraph_summary: The article discusses the shift in U.S. trade policy under Presidents
      Trump and Biden, who both imposed high tariffs on imports, particularly from China,
      marking a departure from the previous half-century of free trade policies that
      favored globalization. This change reflects a broader trend towards economic nationalism,
      as both presidents sought to protect U.S. industries and jobs from foreign competition,
      despite the historical bipartisan support for free trade. The article argues that
      while tariffs may protect certain jobs in specific industries, they can also lead
      to job losses in others, creating a complex and often contradictory economic landscape.
      It highlights the role of corporate interests in shaping political narratives
      around tariffs and free trade, suggesting that the ultimate priority of both sides
      remains profit-driven rather than genuinely focused on job protection. The author
      concludes that the working class should be wary of these capitalist struggles
      and advocates for a system where workers have control over their own workplaces,
      prioritizing job quality and quantity over profit.

  - title: Capitalism and Democracy Are Opposites
    url: https://www.laprogressive.com/author/richard-d-wolff/economic-equality/capitalism-and-democracy
    text: 'Ron Wolff: If PG&E believes so strongly in democracy, shouldn''t it let its
      shareholders vote on whether to support a campaign like this? Don''t hold your
      breath. If capitalism thrives because it promotes market efficiency, what''s wrong
      with letting governments operate utilities if they can do it better than private
      enterprise?


      California''s Proposition 16, on the ballot for the June 8 election, provides
      an interesting case in point for a discussion of the merits of unfettered capitalism
      in a democratic nation that values free speech and extends that right to corporations.


      Basically, this proposed "initiative constitutional amendment" would require,
      with a few exceptions, a two-thirds approval from voters in a selected geographical
      area before a governmental entity could start offering electric service to its
      constituents. It is being bankrolled primarily by PG&E, one of the largest investor-owned
      utilities in the state, which (so far, according to the LA Times has sunk $46
      million into the "Yes on 16" campaign. The money is being used to purchase a mind-numbing
      number of TV ads, plus home mailers.


      Aside from the veracity of the "Yes on 16" effort (see below), let''s look first
      at the initiative itself. If a requirement were being imposed that mandated a
      vote of the people by a simple majority, I wouldn''t be writing this post. But
      imposing a 2/3 requirement makes the motivation for the effort transparent, because
      everyone knows that a supermajority of that magnitude is almost impossible to
      achieve. For example, a presidential election is considered a "landslide" if one
      candidate gets about 55% or more of the vote. President Obama received about 53%
      of the popular vote in 2008. He won 28 states, not even close to 2/3 of them.
      Look how difficult it is for the U.S. Senate even to get 60 votes on controversial
      issues, much less the 67 that would be required to achieve 2/3 of 100.


      Personally, I don''t think that PG&E (plus a host of supporting Chambers of Commerce)
      is supporting Prop 16 to advance democratic principles (although that''s what
      their commercials would lead you to believe). No, they are using their right to
      spend enormous amounts of money (from consumers of their product, of course) to
      advance public policy that will simply give them more control over their ability
      to take more money out of those same consumers'' pockets (by reducing competition).
      Students of democracy, tell me where it says that people should be obligated to
      finance -- without a shareholder vote, of course!! -- the activities of corporations
      that are diametrically opposed to the best long-term interests of the people footing
      the bill!


      If PG&E believes so strongly in democracy, shouldn''t it let its shareholders
      vote on whether to support a campaign like this? Don''t hold your breath. If capitalism
      thrives because it promotes market efficiency, what''s wrong with letting governments
      operate utilities if they can do it better than private enterprise? (I don''t
      know whether they can or not; it probably depends on individual circumstances.
      But throwing up insurmountable barriers is not an appropriate way to find out.)
      What''s next -- shall we have a two-thirds vote before we can operate a publicly
      supported fire department?


      Now look at the mailer I received at my house. Does it mention the two-thirds
      vote requirement? Is a triple fudge sundae good for you? What it says is that
      "Politicians throughout the state want to spend over $2.5 billion in public funds
      for government-run electricity -- and they don''t want to let you vote on it."
      The graphic design experts put a big check on this mailer, payable to "local politicians,"
      for "Gov''t-run electricity," signed by the "California Taxpayer." Brilliant marketing
      -- it hits all the usual "hot buttons." Just unfortunately, it seems to omit one
      vital detail.


      Here''s the bottom line: most of us believe, to a greater or lesser degree, in
      the benefits of both democracy and capitalism. What do we do when one tries to
      destroy the other?

  - title: Given Enough Time, Capitalism Limits Freedom
    url: https://www.laprogressive.com/author/richard-d-wolff/economic-equality/given-enough-time-capitalism-limits-freedom
    text: 'As the French economist Thomas Piketty most recently exposed, capitalism,
      across time and space, has always tended to produce ever-greater economic inequality.
      Oxfam, a global charity, reported that 2022’s 10 richest men together had six
      times more wealth than the poorest 3.1 billion people on earth. The lack of democracy
      inside workplaces or enterprises is both a cause and an effect of capitalism’s
      unequal distribution of income and wealth.


      Of course, inequality predates capitalism. Powerful feudal lords across Europe
      had blended autocracy with unequal distributions of wealth on their manorial estates.
      In fact, the largest and most powerful among the lords—the one named king—was
      usually also the richest. Although revolts against monarchy eventually retired
      most kings and queens (one way or another), similarly rich dictators reemerged
      inside capitalist enterprises as major shareholders and CEOs. Nowadays, their
      palaces imitate the grandeur of kings’ castles. The fortunes of kings and top
      CEOs are similarly extreme and attract the same kind of envy, adulation, and reverence.
      They also draw the same criticism. Inequalities that marked the economy, politics,
      and culture of European feudalism reappeared in capitalism despite the intentions
      of many who revolted against feudalism. The problem: the employer/employee relationship
      is far less a break from the master/slave and lord/serf relations of production
      than capitalism’s champions had hoped for, assumed, and promised in order to secure
      mass support for their revolutions against slavery and feudalism.


      The employer/employee relationship that defines capitalism has created staggering
      inequality by allowing the employer full control over production’s surplus. In
      the past, inequality provoked references to rich capitalists, variously, as “robber
      barons” or as “captains of industry” (depending on the public’s feelings about
      them). Today, they’re referred to as “the rich” or sometimes “the superrich.”


      Is it true that everyone is free in a capitalist system? The answer depends on
      what is meant by “free.” Compare the freedom of Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, or other
      rich capitalists with your freedom. Capitalism distributes some income to you
      and some to Musk, Bezos, and the other rich capitalists. However, to say that
      capitalism makes each of you free ignores the reality that capitalism’s unequal
      distribution of wealth makes you unfree relative to Musk, Bezos, and the other
      rich capitalists.


      Capitalism has often undermined democracy and equality because doing so has reinforced
      and actually strengthened the capitalist organization of the economy.


      Freedom was never only about keeping the government from bothering you; it was
      always also about being able to act, choose, and make a life. To call us all free,
      to use the same word for everyone, erases the very real differences in our access
      to resources, opportunities, and choices needed for life. Musk is free to enjoy
      life, going wherever he likes and doing almost anything you could imagine. He
      may work but need not. The financial cost of anything he might want or need is
      totally irrelevant to him. The overwhelming majority of Americans have nothing
      remotely like such freedom. To say that in capitalism, all are free, like Mr.
      Bezos is nonsense. His freedom depends on the resources at his disposal. You lack
      the freedom to undertake all sorts of actions and choices because those resources
      are not at your disposal.


      The freedom of the rich is not just different; their freedom negates the freedom
      of others. Unequal income and wealth always provoke anxiety among the rich. They
      fear the envy their wealth excites and invites. To protect their positions as
      systemically privileged recipients of income and, thus, accumulators of wealth,
      the rich seek to control both political and cultural institutions. Their goal
      is to shape politics and culture, to make them celebrate and justify income and
      wealth inequalities, not to challenge them. We turn now to how the rich shape
      culture to their benefit.


      How the Rich Shape Culture to Their Benefit


      Unequal access to culture is a feature of capitalism. Culture concerns how people
      think about all aspects of life—how we learn, make, and communicate meanings about
      the world. Our culture shapes what we find acceptable, what we enjoy, and what
      we come to decide needs changing. In European feudalism, access to culture for
      most serfs was shaped chiefly by what the church taught. In turn, the church carefully
      structured its interpretation of the Bible and other texts to reinforce feudal
      rules and traditions. Lords and serfs funded the church to complete the system.
      In modern capitalism, secular public schools undertake formal education alongside
      or instead of churches and other private schools. In today’s world, school education
      celebrates and reinforces capitalism. In turn, the state taxes employers and mostly
      employees to fund public schools and subsidizes private schools, (which also charge
      students).


      Writers like Howard Zinn and Leo Huberman have penned histories of the United
      States, showing that much of what standard U.S. school history textbooks lacked
      were accounts of the many class struggles against capitalism. Instead, rags-to-riches
      stories about people like Horatio Alger were popularized. Examinations of the
      roots of revolt and rebellion against low wages, bad working conditions, and all
      manner of hardship imposed on the workers of America, however, were not.


      In capitalism, mainstream media sources are themselves mostly organized as capitalist
      enterprises. They depend on, understand, and support profit maximization as the
      driving force of their enterprises. Their CEOs can and do make all sorts of definitive
      decisions about what is aired, how events are interpreted, whose careers blossom,
      and whose end. CEOs hire and fire, promote and demote. On mainstream radio, TV,
      and film, we almost never see exciting dramas about anti-capitalist revolutionaries
      who win the day by successfully persuading employees to join them. Rags-to-capitalist-riches
      dramas are, in comparison, routine storylines in countless mainstream media productions.


      In capitalism, culture is constrained to reinforce that system. Even individuals
      who privately criticize capitalism learn early in their careers to keep such criticisms
      private. Periodically, ideological battles can and do break out. If and when they
      coalesce with anti-capitalist upsurges elsewhere in society, cultural criticism
      of capitalism has been, and can again be, a powerful revolutionary force for systemic
      change. That is why defenders of the capitalist system instinctually and ceaselessly
      shape politics, economics, and culture to reinforce that system.


      Capitalism has often undermined democracy and equality because doing so has reinforced
      and actually strengthened the capitalist organization of the economy. As an example
      of capitalism’s corruption of democracy and equality, we consider the mid-American
      town of Kalamazoo, Michigan.


      As in so many other U.S. cities, Kalamazoo’s corporations and its rich have used
      their wealth and power to become richer and more powerful. By donating to politicians,
      threatening to take their businesses elsewhere, and hiring better lawyers than
      the city could afford, the rich reduced the amount of taxes they needed to pay
      to the local government. The rich funded costly, broadly targeted anti-tax campaigns
      that found a receptive audience among the already-overtaxed average citizens.
      Once deprived of the tax revenue from the rich, local politicians either (1) shifted
      more of the tax burden onto average citizens, (2) cut public services in the short
      run, and/or (3) borrowed money and thereby risked having to cut public services
      in the longer run to service city debts. Among those they borrowed from were sometimes
      the same corporations and the rich whose taxes had been reduced after they funded
      successful anti-tax campaigns.


      Eventually, the city saw an accumulation of resident complaints about steadily
      cut public services (uncollected garbage, neglected streets, and deteriorated
      schools), alongside rising taxes and government fees. This litany is familiar
      in many U.S. cities. Eventually, upper- and middle-income residents started to
      leave. That worsened the existing set of problems, so even more people left. Then,
      two of Kalamazoo’s wealthiest and most powerful capitalists—William U. Parfet
      and William D. Johnston—developed a solution they promoted to “save our city.”


      Parfet and Johnston established the “Foundation for Excellence in Kalamazoo.”
      They contributed, according to reports, over $25 million annually to it. Since
      such foundations usually qualify for tax-exempt status at federal, state, and
      local levels of government, the two gentlemen’s contributions lowered their personal
      tax bills. More importantly, the two could wield outsize local political influence.
      They would have much to say about how their foundation funded public services
      in Kalamazoo. In this city, the old democratic notion of everyone paying taxes
      to share in funding the public well-being was replaced by private charity. Public,
      reasonably transparent accountability was replaced by the less transparent, murkier
      foundation activities. Public accountability faded as the private whims of private
      foundations took over.


      What used to be called a “company town” (when a major employer substituted its
      rule for any democratic town rule) often amounted, in the words of PBS, to “slavery
      by another name.” In their modern form, they appear as “foundation cities.” Old
      company towns were rejected nearly everywhere across U.S. history. But, as the
      Kalamazoo example shows, they have returned with names changed.


      "Reforms" in Capitalism


      While capitalism’s general tendency is toward ever-greater inequality, occasional
      redistributions of wealth have happened. These moments have come to be called
      “reforms” and include progressive taxation of income and wealth, welfare entitlements,
      and minimum wage legislation. Redistributive reforms usually occur when middle-income
      and poor people stop tolerating deepening inequality. The biggest and most important
      example in U.S. history was the Great Depression of the 1930s. The New Deal policies
      of the federal government then drastically reduced the inequality of wealth and
      income distribution. Yet employers and the rich have never ceased their opposition
      to new redistributions and their efforts to undo old ones. U.S. politicians learn
      early in their careers what results when they advocate for redistributive reforms:
      an avalanche of criticism coupled with shifts of donors to their political opponents.
      Thus, in the U.S., after the end of World War II in 1945, the employer class changed
      the policies of the federal government. Over the past 80 years, most of what the
      New Deal won has been undone.


      Corporations and the rich hire accountants skilled in hiding money in foreign
      and domestic places that evade reporting to the U.S. Internal Revenue Service.
      Called “tax havens,” those hiding places keep funds that remain untouched by tax
      collectors. In 2013, Oxfam published findings that the trillions stashed away
      in tax havens could end extreme world poverty—twice over. Yet since the revelation
      of this shocking statistic, the inequality of wealth and income has become more
      extreme in nearly every nation on earth. Tax havens persist.


      Conflicts over income, wealth distribution, and wealth redistribution are thus
      intrinsic to capitalism and always have been. Occasionally, they become violent
      and socially disruptive. They may trigger demands for system change. They may
      function as catalysts for revolutions.


      No “solution” to struggles over income and wealth redistribution in capitalism
      was ever found. The reason for that is a system that increasingly enriches a small
      group. The logical response—proposing that income and wealth be distributed more
      equally in the first place—was usually taboo. It was thus largely ignored. The
      French revolutionaries of 1789, who promised “liberty, equality, and fraternity”
      with the transition from feudalism to capitalism, failed. They got that transition,
      but not equality. Marx explained the failure to achieve the promised equality
      resulted from capitalism’s core structure of employer and employee preventing
      equality. In Marx’s view, inequality is inseparable from capitalism and will persist
      until the transition to another system.'
    one_sentence_summary: The article argues that capitalism inherently produces increasing
      economic inequality, as exemplified by the vast wealth of the richest individuals
      compared to the poorest, and highlights how the employer-employee relationship
      perpetuates this inequality while undermining democracy and cultural narratives
      that could challenge the status quo.
    paragraph_summary: The article discusses the inherent tendency of capitalism to
      generate increasing economic inequality, as highlighted by economist Thomas Piketty
      and supported by Oxfam's findings that the wealth of the world's richest men far
      exceeds that of billions of the poorest. It argues that the unequal employer/employee
      relationship in capitalism mirrors historical feudal structures, where wealth
      and power are concentrated among a small elite, undermining true freedom and democracy
      for the majority. The rich not only control economic resources but also shape
      culture and politics to reinforce their privileges, often replacing public accountability
      with private charity, as illustrated by the case of Kalamazoo, Michigan. While
      there have been moments of reform aimed at redistributing wealth, such as the
      New Deal, these efforts have been consistently opposed by the wealthy, leading
      to a cycle of rising inequality that is intrinsic to capitalism. The article concludes
      that true equality remains elusive within the capitalist framework, as the system
      is designed to perpetuate disparities in wealth and power.

  - title: Mass Anger, Capitalism, and 2024 Elections
    url: https://www.laprogressive.com/author/richard-d-wolff/economic-equality/mass-anger
    text: 'In the wake of his huge defeat on June 30, 2024, when 80 percent of voters
      rejected French “centrist” President Emmanuel Macron, he said he understood the
      French people’s anger. In the UK, Conservative loser Rishi Sunak said the same
      about the British people’s anger, as Labor leader Starmer now says as the anger
      explodes. Of course, such phrases from such politicians usually mean little or
      nothing and accomplish less.


      Such leaders and their parties just keep calculating how best to regain power
      when they lose it. In that, they are like the U.S. Democrats after Biden’s performance
      in his debate with Trump and like the U.S. Republicans after Trump’s loss in 2020.
      In both parties, a small group of top leaders and top donors made all the key
      decisions and then organized the political theater to ratify those decisions.
      Even surprises like Harris replacing Biden are temporary departures from resuming
      politics as usual.


      However, unlike Trump, the others missed opportunities to identify with an already
      organized mass base of angry people. Trump stumbled into that identification by
      saying loudly and crudely what traditional politicians treated as publicly unspeakable
      about immigrants, women, NATO, and traditional political taboos. That set the
      tone for Trump then doubling down by insisting he had won the 2020 election but
      had been cheated out of it. The mass anger of populations feeling victimized in
      their workaday lives found a spokesperson loudly claiming parallel victimizations.
      Trump and base grasped that together they might victimize their victimizers.


      Whether or not they can politically exploit voters’ anger, no mainstream leader
      in the collective West, including Trump, seems actually to “understand” it. They
      mostly see only as far as what they can plausibly blame on their opponents in
      the next election. Biden blamed Trump for a “bad” economy in 2020, while Trump
      reversed the same blame over the last year and will shortly adjust to blaming
      Harris. Presidential opponents blame the other for the “immigration crisis,” for
      inadequately protecting U.S. industry from Chinese competition, government budget
      deficits, and job exports.


      No mainstream leader “understands” (or dares to hint or suggest) that mass anger
      these days might be something more and different from any collection of specific
      complaints and demands (about guns, abortion, taxes, and wars). Even the demagogues
      who like to speak about “culture wars” dare not ask why such “wars” are hot now.
      Angry “Make America Great Again” (MAGA) folks are notably vague and poorly informed
      as their critics enjoy exposing. Rarely do those critics offer persuasive alternative
      explanations for MAGA anger (explanations that are neither vague nor poorly informed).


      In particular, we ask, might the anger that the MAGA movement enrolls express
      a genuine mass suffering that has not yet understood its cause? Might that cause
      be nothing less than the decline of Western capitalism and all it represents?
      If ideological taboos and blinders preclude admitting it, might that decline’s
      results—anxiety, despair, and anger—focus instead on suitable scapegoats? Are
      Trump and Biden, Macron and Sunak, and so many others competitively choosing scapegoats
      to mobilize an anger they misunderstand and dare not explore?


      After all, Western capitalism is no longer the world’s colonial master. The American
      empire that succeeded the European empires has now followed them into decline.
      The next empire will be Chinese or else the era of empires will give way to genuine
      global multipolarity. Western capitalism is likewise no longer the world’s dynamic
      growth center as that has moved eastward. Western capitalism is clearly losing
      its former position as the self-confident, unified, ultimate power behind the
      World Bank, United Nations, International Monetary Fund, and the U.S. dollar as
      world currency.


      In terms of global economic footprints as measured by national GDPs, the United
      States and its major allies (G7) comprise a total, aggregated GDP now that is
      already significantly less than the comparable aggregated GDPs of China and its
      major allies (BRICS). The footprints of the two global economic power blocs were
      roughly equal in 2020. The difference between the two footprints has been widening
      ever since and continues to do so. China and its BRICS allies are increasingly
      the world economy’s richest bloc. Nothing prepared the populations of Western
      capitalism for this changed reality or its effects. Especially the sections of
      those populations already forced to absorb the costly burdens of Western capitalism’s
      decline feel betrayed, abandoned, and angry. Elections are merely one way for
      some of them to express those feelings.


      Western capitalism’s rich, powerful, and small minority practices a combination
      of denial and adjustment to its decline. Prevailing politicians, mainstream media,
      and academics continue to orate, write, and act as if the collective West were
      still globally dominant. For them and their ways of thinking, their global dominance
      in the second half of the last century never ended. The wars in Ukraine and Gaza
      testify to that denial and exemplify the costly strategic mistakes it produces.


      When not denying the new reality, significant portions of Western capitalism’s
      corporate rich and powerful are adjusting their preferred economic policies away
      from neoliberalism toward economic nationalism. The chief rationale for that adjustment
      is that it serves “national security” because it may at least slow “China’s aggressiveness.”
      Domestically, the rich and powerful in each country use their positions and resources
      to shift the costs of Western capitalism’s decline onto the mass of their middle-income
      and poorer fellow citizens. They worsen income and wealth inequalities, cut governmental
      social services, and harden police behaviors and prison conditions.


      Denial facilitates the continued decline of Western capitalism. Too little is
      done too late against problems not yet admitted. Deteriorating social conditions
      flowing from that decline, especially for the middle income and the poor, provide
      opportunities for the usual right-wing demagogues. They proceed to blame the decline
      on immigrants, foreigners, excessive state power, the Democrats, China, secularism,
      abortion, and culture war enemies, hoping thereby to assemble a winning electoral
      constituency. Sadly, left-wing commentary focuses on refuting the right’s claims
      about its chosen scapegoats. While its refutations are often well-documented and
      effective in media combat against right-wing Republicans, the left too rarely
      invokes explicit, sustained arguments about mass anger’s links to declining capitalism.
      The left fails sufficiently to stress that government regulators, however well-intentioned,
      have been captured by and subordinated to specifically private capitalist profiteers.


      The mass of people therefore became deeply skeptical about relying on the government
      to correct or offset the failings of private capitalism. People grasp, often just
      intuitively, that today’s problem is the merger of capitalists and government.
      Left and right increasingly feel betrayed by all the promises of center-left and
      center-right politicians. More or less government intervention has changed too
      little in the trajectory of modern capitalism. To growing numbers, politicians
      of the center-left and center-right seem equally docile servants of the capitalist-government
      merger that constitutes modern capitalism with all its failures and flaws. Thus
      today’s right succeeds if, when, and where it can portray itself as not centrist,
      its candidates explicitly anti-centrist. The left is weaker because too many of
      its programs seem still linked to the idea that government interventions will
      correct or offset capitalism’s shortcomings.


      In short, mass anger is disconnected from declining capitalism in part because
      left, right and center deny, avoid, or neglect their link. Mass anger does not
      translate into or yet move to explicit anti-capitalist politics, in part because
      too few organized political movements lead in that way.


      Thus, Rachel Reeves, the Chancellor of the Exchequer in Britain’s new Labour Party
      government—its top financial officer—blithely announces, “There is not a lot of
      money there.” She prepares the public—and preemptively excuses the new government—for
      how little the new government will even try to do. She goes further and defines
      her key goal as “unlocking private investment.” Even the words she chooses mirror
      what the old Conservatives want to hear and would themselves say. In declining
      capitalisms, electoral changes can and often do serve to avoid or at least postpone
      real change.


      Chancellor Reeves’s words assure major corporations and the 1 percent they enrich
      that Starmer’s Labour Party will not heavily tax them. This matters since it is
      precisely in major corporations and the rich that “a lot of money” is located.
      The wealth of the top 1 percent could easily fund a genuinely democratic rebuilding
      of a seriously depleted post-2008 UK economy. In stark contrast, the typical Conservative
      programs prioritizing private investment are what got the UK to its present sad
      state. They were the problem; they are not the solution.


      The Labour Party was once socialist. Socialism once meant a thoroughgoing critique
      of the capitalist system and advocacy of something totally different. Socialists
      sought electoral victories to win government power and use it to transition society
      to a post-capitalist order. But today’s Labour Party has thrown that history away.
      It wants to administer contemporary British capitalism just a bit less harshly
      than Conservatives do. It works to persuade the British working class that “less
      harsh” is the best they can hope and vote for. And British Conservatives can indeed
      smile and condescendingly approve such a Labour Party or else quibble with it
      over how much harshness today’s capitalism “needs.”


      Macron, also once a socialist, plays a similar role in France. Indeed, so do Biden
      and Trump in the United States, Justin Trudeau in Canada, and Olaf Scholz in Germany.
      All offer administrations of their contemporary capitalisms. None have programs
      aimed at solving modern capitalism''s basic, accumulated, and persistently unsolved
      problems. Solutions would require first admitting what those problems are: cyclically
      recurring instability, increasingly unequal distributions of income and wealth,
      monied corruption of politics, mass media, and culture, and increasingly oppressive
      foreign policies that fail to offset a declining Western capitalism. Insistent
      denial across the collective West precludes admitting those problems, let alone
      fashioning solutions to them woven into programs for real change. Alternative
      governments administer; they dare not lead. Would a Kamala Harris-Tim Walz regime
      break with this pattern?


      Their administrations will experiment with and perhaps oscillate between free-trade
      and protectionist policies—as past capitalist governments often did. In the United
      States, recent GOP and Democrat steps toward economic nationalism remain vote-seeking
      exceptions to still widespread commitments to neoliberal globalization. Western
      megacorporations, including many based in the United States, welcome China’s new
      role as the global champion of free trade (even as it retaliates moderately against
      tariffs and trade wars initiated by the collective West). Support remains strong
      for negotiations to shape generally acceptable global divisions of trade and investment
      flows. The latter are seen as profitable as well as a means to avoid dangerous
      wars. Elections will continue to include clashes between capitalism’s free-trade
      and protectionist tendencies.


      But the more fundamental issue of 2024 elections is mass anger in the collective
      West aroused by its historic decline and the effects of that decline on the mass
      of average citizens. How will that anger shape the elections?


      The more extreme right wing recognizes and rides the deeper anger without, of
      course, grasping its relationship to capitalism. Marine Le Pen, Nigel Farage,
      and Trump are all examples. They all mock and deride the center-left and center-right
      governments that merely administer what they depict as a sinking ship that needs
      new, different leadership. But their donor base (capitalist) and long-standing
      ideology (pro-capitalist) block them from going beyond extreme scapegoating (of
      immigrants, ethnic minorities, heterodox sexualities, and foreign demons).


      The mainstream media likewise cannot grasp the relationship of mass anger to capitalism.
      Thus they dismiss the anger as irrational or caused by inadequate “messaging”
      from mainstream influencers. For many months, mainstream economic pundits have
      bemoaned the “strange” coexistence of a “great economy” and polls showing mass
      disappointment at the “bad” economy. By “strange” they mean “stupid” or “ignorant”
      or “politically-motivated/dishonest”: sets of words often condensed into “populist.”


      The left is jealous of the extreme right’s significant mass base now in working-class
      areas. In most countries, the left has spent the last many decades trying to hold
      on to its working-class base as the mainstream’s center-left movement pulled it
      away. That meant a greater or lesser shift from communist and anarchist to ever
      more “moderate” socialist and democratic affiliations. That shift included downplaying
      the goal of a comprehensively different post-capitalism in favor of the immediate
      goal of a state-fostered softer, humane capitalism where wages and benefits were
      greater, taxes more progressive, cycles more regulated, and minorities less oppressed.
      For that left, what mass anger it could recognize flowed from failures to achieve
      such a state-fostered softer capitalism, not from Western capitalism’s decline.


      As capitalism’s dynamic center moved to Asia and elsewhere in the global South,
      decline set in among its old, more-or-less abandoned centers. Old center capitalists
      participated in and profited greatly as the system relocated its dynamic center.
      Capitalists, both state and private, in the new centers profited even more. In
      the old centers, the rich and powerful shifted the burdens of decline onto the
      masses. In the new centers, the rich and powerful gathered the new capitalist
      wealth there mostly into their hands but with enough trickling down to satisfy
      large portions of their working classes. That’s how capitalism works and always
      has. For the mass of employees, however, the ride upwards when capitalism’s dynamic
      center is where they work and live is far more pleasant and hopeful than when
      decline sets in. The ride down provokes depression and traumas. When they fester
      without admission or discussion, they often morph into anger.

    paragraph_summary: The article discusses the widespread political discontent and
      anger in Western democracies, particularly following significant electoral defeats
      for centrist leaders like Emmanuel Macron and Rishi Sunak, who acknowledge public
      frustration but fail to address its root causes. It argues that mainstream politicians,
      including Biden and Trump, often misinterpret or ignore the deeper issues linked
      to the decline of Western capitalism, which has resulted in rising inequality,
      economic instability, and a sense of betrayal among the populace. Instead of offering
      genuine solutions, these leaders tend to scapegoat various groups or blame their
      opponents, while the left struggles to articulate a coherent response that connects
      mass anger to the failures of capitalism. The article posits that as the global
      economic landscape shifts, the anger stemming from capitalism's decline is not
      adequately addressed, leading to a political environment where right-wing populists
      exploit this discontent without challenging the underlying capitalist system.
      Ultimately, it suggests that without acknowledging and confronting the systemic
      issues at play, political changes will merely serve to perpetuate the status quo
      rather than foster meaningful reform.

  - title: 'As the U.S. Empire Declines: Where Is It Taking Us All?'
    url: https://www.laprogressive.com/author/richard-d-wolff/economic-equality/u-s-empire-declines
    text: 'The evidence suggests that empires often react to periods of their own decline
      by over-extending their coping mechanisms. Military actions, infrastructure problems,
      and social welfare demands may then combine or clash, accumulating costs and backlash
      effects that the declining empire cannot manage. Policies aimed to strengthen
      empire—and that once did—now undermine it. Contemporary social changes inside
      and outside the empire can reinforce, slow, or reverse the decline. However, when
      decline leads leaders to deny its existence, it can become self-accelerating.
      In empires’ early years, leaders and the led may repress those among them who
      stress or merely even mention decline. Social problems may likewise be denied,
      minimized, or, if admitted, blamed on convenient scapegoats—immigrants, foreign
      powers, or ethnic minorities—rather than linked to imperial decline.


      The U.S. empire, audaciously proclaimed by the Monroe Doctrine soon after two
      independence wars won against Britain, grew across the 19th and 20th centuries,
      and peaked during the decades between 1945 and 2010. The rise of the U.S. empire
      overlapped with the decline of the British empire. The Soviet Union represented
      limited political and military challenges, but never any serious economic competition
      or threat. The Cold War was a lopsided contest whose outcome was programmed in
      from its beginning. All of the U.S. empire’s potential economic competitors or
      threats were devastated by World War II. The following years found Europe losing
      its colonies. The unique global position of the United States then, with its disproportional
      position in world trade and investment, was anomalous and likely unsustainable.
      An attitude of denial at the time that decline was all but certain morphed only
      too readily into the attitude of denial now that the decline is well underway.


      The United States could not prevail militarily over all of Korea in its 1950–53
      war there. The United States lost its subsequent wars in Vietnam, Afghanistan,
      and Iraq. The NATO alliance was insufficient to alter any of those outcomes. U.S.
      military and financial support for Ukraine and the massive United States and NATO
      sanctions war against Russia are failures to date and are likely to remain so.
      U.S. sanctions programs against Cuba, Iran, and China have failed too. Meanwhile,
      the BRICS alliance counteracts U.S. policies to protect its empire, including
      its sanctions warfare, with increasing effectiveness.


      In the realms of trade, investment, and finance, we can measure the decline of
      the U.S. empire differently. One index is the decline of the U.S. dollar as a
      central bank reserve holding. Another is its decline as a means of trade, loans,
      and investment. Finally, consider the U.S. dollar’s decline alongside that of
      dollar-denominated assets as internationally desired means of holding wealth.
      Across the Global South, countries, industries, or firms seeking trade, loans,
      or investments used to go to London, Washington, or Paris for decades; they now
      have other options. They can go instead to Beijing, New Delhi, or Moscow, where
      they often secure more attractive terms.


      Empire confers special advantages that translate into extraordinary profits for
      firms located in the country that dominates the empire. The 19th century was remarkable
      for its endless confrontations and struggles among empires competing for territory
      to dominate and thus for their industries’ higher profits. Declines of any one
      empire could enhance opportunities for competing empires. If the latter grabbed
      those opportunities, the former’s decline could worsen. One set of competing empires
      delivered two world wars in the last century. Another set seems increasingly driven
      to deliver worse, possibly nuclear world wars in this century.


      Before World War I, theories circulated that the evolution of multinational corporations
      out of merely national mega-corporations would end or reduce the risks of war.
      Owners and directors of increasingly global corporations would work against war
      among countries as a logical extension of their profit-maximizing strategies.
      The century’s two world wars undermined those theories’ appearance of truth. So
      too did the fact that multinational mega-corporations increasingly purchased governments
      and subordinated state policies to those corporations’ competing growth strategies.
      Capitalists’ competition governed state policies at least as much as the reverse.
      Out of their interaction emerged the wars of the 21st century in Afghanistan,
      Iraq, Syria, Ukraine, and Gaza. Likewise from their interaction, rising U.S.-China
      tensions emerged around Taiwan and the South China Sea.


      China presents a unique analytical problem. The private capitalist half of its
      hybrid economic system exhibits growth imperatives parallel to those agitating
      economies where 90–100 percent of enterprises are private capitalist in organization.
      The state-owned-and-operated enterprises comprising the other half of China’s
      economy exhibit different drives and motivations. Profit is less their bottom
      line than it is for private capitalist enterprises. Similarly, the Communist Party’s
      rule over the state—including the state’s regulation of the entire Chinese economy—introduces
      other objectives besides profit, ones that also govern enterprise decisions. Since
      China and its major economic allies (BRICS) comprise the entity now competing
      with the declining U.S. empire and its major economic allies (G7), China’s uniqueness
      may yield an outcome different from past clashes of empires.


      In the past, one empire often supplanted another. That may be our future with
      this century becoming “China’s” as previous empires were American, British, and
      so on. However, China’s history includes earlier empires that rose and fell: another
      unique quality. Might China’s past and its present hybrid economy influence China
      away from becoming another empire and rather toward a genuinely multipolar global
      organization instead? Might the dreams and hopes behind the League of Nations
      and the United Nations achieve reality if and when China makes that happen? Or
      will China become the next global hegemon against heightened resistance from the
      United States, bringing the risk of nuclear war closer?


      A rough historical parallel may shed some additional light from a different angle
      on where today’s class of empires may lead. The movement toward independence of
      its North American colony irritated Britain sufficiently for it to attempt two
      wars (1775–83 and 1812–15) to stop that movement. Both wars failed. Britain learned
      the valuable lesson that peaceful co-existence with some co-respective planning
      and accommodation would enable both economies to function and grow, including
      in trade and investment both ways across their borders. That peaceful co-existence
      extended to allowing the imperial reach of the one to give way to that of the
      other.


      Why not suggest a similar trajectory for U.S.-China relations over the next generation?
      Except for ideologues detached from reality, the world would prefer it over the
      nuclear alternative. Dealing with the two massive, unwanted consequences of capitalism—climate
      change and unequal distributions of wealth and income—offers projects for a U.S.-China
      partnership that the world will applaud. Capitalism changed dramatically in both
      Britain and the United States after 1815. It will likely do so again after 2025.
      The opportunities are attractively open-ended.

      to U.S.-centric economic systems. The article suggests that rather than following

  - title: What Kamala Might Have Said About Immigration
    url: https://www.laprogressive.com/author/richard-d-wolff/immigration-reform/what-kamala-might-have-said
    text: 'The immigration issue has split and/or weakened both center and left parties
      and movements across many nations in recent years. Serious economic and social
      problems afflicting national working classes have been “managed”—at least temporarily—by
      scapegoating immigrants as if they were responsible for those problems. Leaders
      on the left fear that many among their supporters are vulnerable to that scapegoating.
      In contrast, leaders on the right often see that scapegoating as a means to achieve
      electoral gains. Trump reflected and strengthened the view that such scapegoating
      can get votes. The widespread perception that Kamala Harris too would be “tough
      on immigrants” showed that she offered no real alternative program on immigration.
      Thus, the classically reactionary posing of the issue as “protecting the nation
      against an immigrant ‘invasion’” widely prevailed.


      Appeals to morality, multiculturalism, and compassion for the plight of most immigrants
      failed to dissuade many on the left from disengaging and moving politically rightward.
      The center or moderate left needs but lacks clear, strong support for immigrants
      that does not alienate portions of their traditional electoral base. “Me-too”
      opposition to immigration, even if less harsh and hostile than that of the professional
      demagogues, will fail, as Kamala Harris’s campaign discovered. Moreover, classic
      left reformism suggests a radically different program on immigration. It is derived
      from the reformist program (the “Green New Deal”) to address climate change when
      it faced a parallel problem with job-holders in polluting industries. A parallel
      reformist program to deal with immigration might be called an “Inclusive New Deal.”


      In contrast, conservative, right-wing, and fascistic political forces have used
      extreme opposition to immigration to grow their ranks. Those forces boldly accuse
      immigrants of bringing crime, disease, downward pressure on wages, competition
      for jobs, and burdensome, costly demands on schools, hospitals, and other public
      services. Even in the United States, a country mostly composed of successive immigrant
      waves (who obliterated and replaced the indigenous people), many of those immigrants’
      descendants now hold anti-immigrant views. Despite massive evidence to the contrary,
      they rationalize those views by insisting that, unlike former immigrants, today’s
      differ in being “unwilling to work.”


      Rightists advance their radical “solutions” such as sharply tightening immigration
      rules, refusing all further immigration, and deporting millions. Even where moral,
      ethical, and religious traditions call us to welcome immigrants, right-wingers
      have found that anti-immigration politics can work well. They attack center-leftists
      for seeking future votes by being pro-immigration or only weakly anti-immigration.
      In the United States, they attack the Democratic Party for not putting their American-born
      constituents first. Patriotism, as defined by such rightists, now entails a strict
      anti-immigrant position that displaces traditional religions’ endorsement of the
      opposite.


      Immigrants forced to arrive as slaves, Black people in the United States, for
      example, fared differently: their integration was mostly slower and much more
      partial. Brown immigrants who arrived as other than slaves also suffered slower
      and partial integration. Anti-Black-and-Brown racism added further discrimination
      and life difficulties to the experience of those immigrants. Institutionalized
      racism denied opportunities for such immigrant communities to develop their members’
      levels of education, job skills, businesses, personal wealth, and social confidence.
      All immigrants suffer delays in their access to those qualities and capabilities,
      but the addition of racism worsens and lengthens those delays, including in U.S.
      society today. The difficulties usually endured by immigrants slow and skew the
      development of the economy they have entered. The occasional explosions of immigrants’
      resentments and bitterness at their treatment—and the usually very violent subsequent
      repressions—then add further damage to their host economies.


      Repeated efforts by those opposed to immigration have rarely succeeded in stopping
      it. The broad range of social forces—including the persistent effects of colonial
      and neo-colonial subjugation, uneven capitalist development, and climate change—that
      propel people to emigrate usually outweigh their concerns for their own economic,
      personal safety, and family interests. For employers, immigration can cheapen
      labor costs by expanding the supply of labor power (especially when the opposite
      is threatened by falling birthrates or when capital accumulation risks bidding
      up wages). Undocumented immigrants offer employers notoriously outrageous opportunities
      for super-exploitation. Hence, they often support it.


      An important social cost of immigration is the opportunity it has regularly presented
      to demagogic politicians. They have repeatedly scapegoated immigrants to deflect
      genuine mass discontent where it might otherwise threaten the domestic employer
      class. Is there unemployment? The demagogue suggests that jobs are being preferentially
      reserved for immigrants. Are public services inadequate? The demagogue suggests
      that immigrants are placing excessive demands on them and corrupt officials are
      directing them to immigrants to secure cheap labor or votes. Demagogues often
      insist—again despite evidence to the contrary—that immigrants commit more crimes
      and bring and spread more disease than the native-born.


      The campaigns of Donald Trump and many Republicans scapegoated immigrants. Many
      Democrats’ campaigns likewise featured the scapegoating of immigrants. In contrast,
      the real, basic economic problems of the United States were not seriously addressed
      in the latest presidential election campaigns. One of those is the immense gap
      between haves and have-nots that has widened over the last 40 years. Another is
      the economic instability that has the economy oscillating between inflation and
      recessions. Still another is the obvious decline of the American empire (the relatively
      declining roles of U.S. exports, imports, investments, and the dollar) within
      the global economy. These issues were marginalized or, more often, ignored. Instead,
      candidates relentlessly scapegoated 12 million undocumented immigrants (among
      the poorest of the poor) as if they were the cause of and thus to blame for the
      deep problems of U.S. capitalism, an economy of 330 million people. Likewise,
      they excoriated China for the economic competition its economic growth has brought
      to the United States. Doing that conveniently deflects blame from the corporate
      employers who made the decision to move production from the United States to China.
      As usual, all social blame or criticism must be kept from touching the U.S. capitalist
      system that accounts for those profit-driven decisions.


      Deep, costly, and lasting consequences have followed the demagoguery and divisions
      in societies that split over immigration. Much energy, time, and money is diverted
      from dealing with the nation’s real economic problems to obsessive “coping with”
      immigration (homeland security budgets, border patrol budgets, and wall construction
      and maintenance). Still more is devoted to housing, policing, feeding, and otherwise
      “processing” undocumented immigrants. If high-priority policy instead created
      good jobs with good incomes for immigrants, huge portions of these social costs
      would be unnecessary. Moreover, worthwhile alternatives to failed existing immigration
      policies are available if sufficient political power places them on the social
      and political agendas of societies confronting immigration. A remarkable flaw
      of today’s global capitalism lies in its provocation of massive migration of people
      alongside its massive, costly failure to plan or manage that migration.


      One such alternative policy could solve together the recurring problems of unemployment,
      inadequate housing and social services, and immigration. In the U.S. case, another
      Marshall Plan or “Inclusive” New Deal, green or otherwise, is needed. It could
      create jobs performing public services (paid at or above the current median for
      such jobs) that would be provided, as a right, to every unemployed citizen as
      priority #1. As priority #2, equivalent jobs would be provided, as a right, to
      all immigrants. As priority #3, the jobs thus created would include expanding
      the housing and all other social services needed to adequately accommodate the
      entire population, native plus immigrant. The tragic social divisiveness of immigrant-vs-native
      competition for jobs might thereby be sharply reduced.


      Such an Inclusive New Deal could be funded by


      billions of dollars no longer needed for unemployment insurance,


      increased income and other taxes paid by newly employed native and immigrant workers,


      increased taxes paid by businesses profiting from increased spending by those
      workers, and


      an annual wealth tax of 2 percent on all personal wealth above $20 million. Immigration
      could be reduced for the first five years of this Inclusive New Deal to get it
      fully established and running.


      A major side benefit of this Inclusive New Deal would be the huge boost in receipts
      for Social Security. Another such benefit would be the reduced demands placed
      on social services by the better physical and mental health of all newly employed
      workers. Finally, as a social dividend from such an Inclusive New Deal, the official
      work week in the United States for all workers could be reduced from 40 to 36
      hours (with no pay reduction).


      Imagine the enormous social benefits that would accrue to the entire U.S. population,
      native and immigrant, from this different reformist approach to the immigration
      issue. In the United States and beyond, such an approach would reduce the social
      divisions over jobs, incomes, housing, homelessness, social services, and immigration.
      A strong, growing economy attracts immigrants, integrates them productively, and
      thereby impresses the world. A weak, declining economy not only fails to employ
      all its people productively but by deporting immigrants advertises its failure
      to the world. A radical program would embrace the freedom to migrate as universal
      and therefore reorient the global location of investment to serve that freedom
      both domestically and internationally.

    text: '“Understanding Capitalism” critically re-thinks capitalism’s prominence in
      our society and positively answers the question: “Can we do better than capitalism?”


      Understanding Capitalism is for students, activists, teachers, and mostly everyone
      interested in systemic change. It clarifies confusion over what capitalism is,
      its problems and flaws, and its links to race, class, fascism, the state, debt,
      immigration, and more. Understanding Capitalism shows how this system shapes us
      all today and also points us toward an emerging, better economic system.


      “Rick Wolff is the most influential Marxist economist in America! His rich intellectual
      range, from the decline of the American empire to the deeply racist character
      of predatory capitalist processes, is extraordinary! His courageous and analytical
      voice is a light in our grim times!” -Cornel West


      As Professor Wolff says. "I have spent my entire adult life split between academic
      and activist pursuits. Both this latest book, “Understanding Capitalism” and its
      publisher, Democracyatwork.info represent a culmination of a life’s work. Here
      we explain what capitalism is and is not – showing why very different definitions
      matter. We dissolve the many myths that obscure how capitalism works. We analyze
      capitalism’s problems to make our world a better place by going beyond capitalism
      to specific alternative systems."


      As capitalism faces increasing scrutiny and powerful questions about its ability
      to solve accumulated social and personal problems, "Understanding Capitalism"
      provides a condensed exploration of these issues. Activists of all kinds – including
      students and teachers – will find this book full of useful insights to aid their
      work.


      Richard D. Wolff is Professor Emeritus of Economics at the University of Massachusetts
      Amherst and currently a Visiting Professor at the New School in New York City.

  - title: Political Economy Contradictions Facing Us as We Lurch Into 2025
    url: https://www.laprogressive.com/author/richard-d-wolff/progressive-issues/political-economy-contradictions
    text: 'The Republicans (GOP), traditionally the U.S.’s anti-tax party, now promise
      to use tariffs to wage trade wars, to massively deport immigrants, and to stop
      drug traffic. But tariffs are simply the name of one kind of tax (on imported
      goods and services). So the GOP becomes both anti-tax and pro-tax. Likewise, the
      traditional party of minimal government, today’s GOP now favors massive subsidies
      to industries that big government will select as well as economic sanctions and
      bans on enterprises and whole countries that big government will select. Beyond
      the right-wing ideology and financial self-serving, Trump reflects deeper contradictions
      in the GOP’s evolution.


      The GOP, traditionally the laissez-faire party of private enterprise, now favors
      increased government control of what private enterprises can and cannot offer
      in markets for reproductive healthcare, control medications and devices, and also
      for vaccines and drugs. The GOP, traditionally supporting “freedom,” now insists
      on blocking the free movement of people across borders and favors protectionist
      economic policy over a commitment to “free trade.” Some of Trump’s cabinet nominees
      voice traditional GOP views while others pronounce the new anti-traditional positions.
      Some nominees do both. Trump does not resolve the deep contradictions in the GOP’s
      message, thereby confusing both its messengers and its public audiences. In the
      moment, those contradictions give Trump some power. Amid the confusion, he decides.
      But soon conflicts among U.S. policies will expose the incoherence of Trump’s
      project and thereby sap his power.


      The Democratic party was, at least since the Great Depression of the 1930s, the
      “progressive” party of working people, unions, and oppressed minorities. Yet the
      rise of the “centrists” across recent decades shifted the Democrats rightward.
      As they became grateful recipients of corporate and billionaires’ donations, the
      Democrats increasingly supported the donor class by fielding “moderate” candidates,
      moderating their policies and programs, and publicly marginalizing the party’s
      remaining progressive wing. Privately, the Democrats’ centrist leaders pleaded
      and maneuvered to retain the traditional support of labor unions, oppressed minorities,
      and educated professionals. Moderation rendered the Democrats’ pursuit of gains
      for their traditional supporters ever less effective. So too did Democrats’ hold
      on those constituencies’ electoral commitments and loyalties dissipate. Success
      with donors contradicted deepening failures with voters, most starkly exposed
      in the 2024 election.


      Multiple, intense, and persistent contradictions within both parties suggest that
      some underlying, historic shifts may be underway. In my view, the first of those
      shifts is the peaking and subsequent decline in recent decades of the U.S. empire
      and its allies (especially the G7). This shift reflects and feeds the concurrent
      rise of the Global South, China, and the BRICS. A second shift is the accumulation
      of U.S. capitalism’s internal economic problems and difficulties. These are inadequately
      acknowledged, let alone solved. Chief among the problems are the long-term worsening
      of wealth and income inequalities and the persistent boom-bust or recession-inflation
      cycles for which no solution has been found.


      In short, both the GOP and the Democrats have denied both shifts. Indeed, denial
      has so far been the parties’ shared response to the linked declines of global
      empire and domestic capitalism. Denial rarely solves problems. It usually enables
      or provokes them to worsen until they explode.


      The key contradictions roiling political parties and their economic policies work
      parallel effects among professional economists. Unresolved, stale debates among
      economists react back upon policies, politicians, and public discourse to render
      them frustratingly powerless to fix what the public sees increasingly as a broken
      system. Starting with Adam Smith, David Ricardo, and the doctrine of laissez-faire
      and, especially since John Maynard Keynes, a huge portion of the profession has
      centered its work around an ongoing, seemingly endless debate. The question is
      whether our capitalist system is best served by minimal versus large, ongoing
      government interventions in its operation. Should we privilege pro-laissez-faire
      economics (the so-called neoclassical tradition) or governmental interventionist
      economics (the so-called Keynesian tradition) or some “synthesis” of both?


      This debate figured prominently in U.S. university economics classes 20, 40, and
      60 years ago much as it does in such classes today. The themes of that debate
      echoed prominently in the language of politics then and now. Occasionally, a few
      politicians recognized that the overdrawn oppositions, in theory, did not correspond
      all that well with actual practical politics. Nixon once said, “We are all Keynesian
      now.” Clinton boasted that he had “ended welfare as we know it.” Trump regularly
      excoriates Democrats as “radical left lunatics” and includes “fascists” among
      them. All three presidents were proved wrong, albeit quite self-assured, in making
      such confused and confusing statements.


      Yet the centrality of the private-versus-government dispute in both economic theory
      and policy continues. Its social usefulness lies more in what it excludes rather
      than in anything positive it includes. Putting that debate at the core of economics
      has helped prevent alternative cores from emerging that would challenge both neoclassical
      and Keynesian economics. One such alternative core would question whether top-down
      hierarchical organizations of production (the employer-employee model) better
      serve societies than horizontally egalitarian, democratic organizations (the worker
      coop model). Debates might then focus on which organization of production better
      preserves the natural environment, reduces income and wealth inequalities, overcomes
      cyclical economic instability, or advances the physical and mental health of people.


      The contradictions agitating discourses and practices these days may stem from
      the exhaustion of old economic and political traditions even as a new tradition
      is not yet clearly emerging. On the one hand, the U.S. and the UK now join Europe
      in turning clearly toward government-run protectionism instead of free trade.
      On the other, state-supervised China and India, among others, support free trade.
      The economic growth records of the USSR in the 20th century and of China in the
      21st century undermine preferences for private over state-regulated capitalisms.
      The old debate yields no new light on such central economic issues these days
      as the rise of the BRICS bloc in the world economy relative to the declines of
      an already smaller G7 bloc and the U.S. dollar in world trade.


      Of course, economists and politicians whose resumes mark them as leading proponents
      of neoclassical economics and privatization keep trying—like their Keynesian counterparts—to
      sustain the old debates that made them relevant. If they succeed, it will be because
      a still prevailing system prefers to rehash the old rather than welcome and explore
      what is emerging. In any case, however, relentless change will continue to work
      its ways on a passing U.S. empire and its capitalist system.

    url: https://www.laprogressive.com/author/richard-d-wolff/foreign-policy/brics-grows-as-u-s-problems-grow
    text: 'Societies survive and grow when they successfully navigate their contradictions.
      Eventually, however, accumulating contradictions overwhelm existing means of navigating
      them. Then social problems arise that persist or worsen inside such societies
      because they are unsuccessfully navigated or go unattended. Sometimes, the dominant
      conscious reaction to such social problems is denial, a refusal to see them. Denial
      of internal social problems displaces navigating the contradictions that cause
      them. The resulting social decline, like the set of internal contradictions it
      reflects, is denied and ignored. Instead, narratives or rhetorics can arise that
      position such societies as victims of abuse by foreigners. The United States in
      2025 illustrates this process: its rhetorics of refusal aim to end its victimization.


      In today’s United States, one such rhetoric refuses to allow continued abuse by
      foreigners “threatening our national security.” This rhetoric blames bad U.S.
      political leadership for its failure to put America first and thereby make it
      great again. Another rhetoric demands that “we” refuse to allow “our democracy”
      to be destroyed by foreign enemies (and their domestic equivalents): people who
      are said to hate, not understand, or undervalue “our democracy.” Still another
      rhetoric of refusal sees foreigners “cheating” the United States in trade and
      migration processes. Most Americans embrace one or more of such rhetorics. Yet,
      as we propose to show here, such rhetorics are ever less effective.


      Why Trump is Threatening to Retake the Panama Canal


      One reactionary rhetoric, Trump’s, gestures toward former greatness by literally
      renewing American imperialism. He threatens to retake the Panama Canal, change
      Canada into the 51st of the United States, conquer Greenland from Denmark, and
      possibly invade Mexico. All those foreigners are said to threaten national security
      or else “cheat” the United States. Trump’s typical bloviating aside, this is remarkable
      expansionism. Such repeated colonialist gestures feed broader notions of making
      America greater again.


      Colonialism repeatedly helped European capitalism navigate its internal contradictions
      (temporarily escaping the social problems it caused). Eventually, however, it
      could no longer do so. After World War II, anti-colonialism limited that escape.
      The subsequent European neo-colonialisms and the informal colonialism of the American
      empire had shorter life spans. China and the rest of the BRICS countries are now
      everywhere closing that escape. Hence the frustrated rage of Trump’s insistence
      on refusing that ending by deliberately reopening the idea of an escape hatch
      of colonial expansions. It resembles Netanyahu’s idea (if not yet his violence)
      in trying to reopen that hatch for Israel by driving Palestinians out of Gaza.
      United States support for Netanyahu likewise associates the U.S. with colonialist
      violence in a world overwhelmingly committed to end colonialism and its unwanted
      legacy.


      The United States boasts the world’s strongest military establishment. The dominant
      rhetoric in the United States casts everything it does as self-defense necessitated
      by foreign enemies. That justifies the government spending much more on defense
      than on the few internal social problems that rhetoric even recognizes. Yet the
      United States lost the wars in Vietnam, Afghanistan, Iraq, and now Ukraine, and
      these countries’ military establishments were far from the world’s strongest.
      It turns out that the proliferation of nuclear weapons and technical competition
      among nuclear powers have changed military balances around the world. The United
      States’ gross underestimates of Russia’s warfare capacities in 2022 illustrate
      the change very dramatically. They also illustrate that rhetoric stressing a refusal
      to be victimized by foreign militaries undercuts or displaces sober analyses of
      a militarily changed world. Now the world observes not only changed global military
      configurations but also the costly denials of them by U.S. leaders. Political
      and economic leaders everywhere else are now rethinking their strategies accordingly.
      Rhetorics of refusal to be victimized can become self-destructive.


      Another reason those leaders are redesigning their growth plans follows from the
      intertwined declines of the U.S. empire and the U.S. capitalist system. What U.S.
      leaders deny, many foreign leaders have incentives to see, evaluate, and take
      advantage of. The BRICS members (9) and partners (9), as of January 2025, account
      for nearly half the world’s population and 41 percent of the world’s GDP (in purchasing
      power parity terms). Four other nations have been invited and are likely to join
      in 2025: Vietnam, Turkey, Algeria, and Nigeria. Indonesia just joined as a full
      BRICS partner, adding its roughly 280 million population. In contrast, the G7—the
      world’s second-largest economic bloc—accounts for about 10 percent of the world’s
      population and 30 percent of its GDP (also in purchasing power parity terms).
      Moreover, as data from the International Monetary Fund documents, recent years
      show a widening gap between the annual GDP growth rates of the G7-leading United
      States and the BRICS-leading China and India.


      Across the history of capitalism, from its earlier times in England through the
      American empire’s peak early in the 21st century, most nations focused chiefly
      on the G7 in strategizing economic growth, debt, trade, investments, currency
      exchange rates, and balances of payments. Large- and medium-sized enterprises
      did likewise. Yet over the last 15–20 years, countries and enterprises have faced
      an altogether new, different global situation. China, India, and the rest of the
      BRICS countries offer an alternative possible focus. Everyone can now play the
      two blocks against one another. Moreover, in this play, the BRICS now hold better,
      richer cards than the G7. Rhetorics of refusal spin these changes in the world
      economy as the evil intentions of foreign others—who likely hate democracy. The
      United States should righteously refuse and thereby frustrate those intentions,
      they argue. In contrast, far less attention is paid to how internal U.S. social
      problems both shape and are shaped by a changing global economy.


      Foreign Student Numbers Dropping in U.S. Colleges and Universities


      The changing world economy and the relative decline of the G7 within it have turned
      U.S. capitalism away from neoliberal globalization toward economic nationalism.
      Tariffs, trade wars, and “America first” ideological pronouncements are concurrent
      forms of such turning inward. Another form is the call to bring parts of the outside
      of the United States inside: Trump’s unsubtle imperialistic threats directed at
      Canada, Mexico, Denmark, and Panama. Yet another form is the advisory many major
      U.S. colleges and universities are sending to enrolled students from other countries
      (over a million last year). It suggests they consider the likelihood of great
      visa difficulties in completing their degrees amid increasing U.S. government
      hostility toward foreigners. A reduced foreign student presence will undercut
      U.S. influence abroad for years to come (much as it fostered that influence in
      the past). U.S. higher education institutions, already facing serious financial
      difficulties, will find them deepening as paying foreign students choose other
      nations for their degrees. “America first” rhetoric risks the self-destruction
      of the United States’ global position.


      Politically, the U.S. strategy since World War II was to contain perceived foreign
      threats by a combination of “hard” and “soft” power. They would enable the United
      States to eliminate communism, socialism, and, after the Soviet implosion of 1989,
      terrorism, wherever possible, overtly or covertly. Hard power would be deployed
      by the U.S. military via hundreds of foreign military bases surrounding nations
      perceived to be threatening and via invasions if, when, and where deemed necessary.
      Hard power also took the form of implicit threats of nuclear warfare (made credible
      by the U.S. atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki) and by total U.S. arms
      race expenditures on nuclear and non-nuclear weapons that no other countries,
      alone or in groups, could match.


      “Soft power” would serve globally to project particular definitions of democracy,
      civil liberties, higher education, scientific achievement, and popular culture.
      These definitions were presented as best and most exemplified by what actually
      existed in the United States. In this way, the United States could be exalted
      as the global peak of civilized human achievement: a kind of partner discourse
      to other discourses that denied internal social problems. Enemies could then readily
      be demonized as inferior.


      U.S. soft power was and remains a kind of political advertising. The usual commercial
      advertiser promotes only everything positive (real or plausible) about his client’s
      product. Typically, everything negative (real or plausible) is associated by that
      same advertiser only with his client’s competitor’s product. One might call this
      “advertising communication.” In the 20th century’s Cold War, U.S. soft power entailed
      an application of advertising communication where the United States and its supporters,
      public and private, functioned as both client and advertiser. The United States
      advertised itself as “democracy” and the USSR as its negative opposite or “dictatorship.”
      Cold War advertising communication continues today in the slightly changed form
      of “democracy” versus “authoritarianism.” But like advertising, after too many
      repetitions its influence lessens.


      The U.S. Brandishes Threat of Tariffs


      Unfortunately for the United States, economic problems now besetting its capitalist
      system—both those caused by accumulated internal contradictions and those caused
      by its declining position within the world economy—directly undercut its soft
      power projections. Brandishing tariffs and repeatedly threatening to increase
      them reflect the need for governmental protection for decreasingly competitive
      U.S.-based firms. U.S. rhetorics that instead blame foreigners for “cheating”
      sound increasingly hollow. Deporting millions of immigrants signals an economy
      no longer strong and growing enough to absorb them productively (what once “made
      America great” and showed that greatness to the world). U.S. rhetorics denouncing
      “foreign invasions” of immigrants encounter growing skepticism and even ridicule
      inside as well as outside the United States.


      The gross inequality of wealth and income in the United States and the global
      exposure of billionaires’ power over government (Musk over Trump, CEOs donating
      millions of dollars to Trump’s inauguration celebration) replace perceptions of
      the United States as exceptional in its vast middle class. The record levels of
      government, corporate, and household debt alongside abundant signs that such indebtedness
      is worsening do not help project the United States as an economic model. The year
      2024’s experience with a dominant U.S. strategy denying social problems while
      rhetorically stressing the dangers of evil foreign forces suggests it may be approaching
      exhaustion. The year 2025 may then provide conditions for a profound challenge
      to that strategy, matching the challenges confronting the global position of U.S.
      capitalism.

      particularly under Trump’s rhetoric, which distract from the nation’s declining
      global influence and economic position, ultimately risking self-destruction through
      an inward turn and imperialistic threats.
    paragraph_summary: The article discusses how societies, including the United States,
      struggle to manage internal contradictions, leading to social problems that are
      often ignored or denied. In the U.S., this denial manifests in various rhetorics
      that portray the nation as a victim of foreign threats, blaming external forces
      for its internal issues, such as economic decline and political dysfunction. The
      article highlights the rise of nationalist sentiments and imperialistic rhetoric,
      particularly under Trump, which seeks to reclaim former American dominance through
      aggressive foreign policies. However, these strategies are increasingly ineffective
      as the global landscape shifts, with the BRICS nations gaining economic power
      and the U.S. facing declining influence. The article argues that the U.S. must
      confront its internal contradictions rather than displace them onto foreign adversaries,
      as continued denial risks self-destruction and undermines its global standing.

    text: 'I’ve been reflecting on the overwhelming surprise and rage expressed by the
      masses of white people at the actions of U.S. Customs and Border Protection with
      respect to the policies at the border: the separation of children from their families
      and the tear gassing of asylum seekers. Given the massive public outcry against
      these actions, it signals that for many white people across the country, this
      is the first introduction to our southern border policies. And the sight of children
      in cages rightfully touched a nerve among everyday Americans, where even those
      who have not been politically active refused to remain silent and thrust themselves
      into visible action to demand a change. A broad-based shift in consciousness is
      welcome, for this provides the critical mass needed for action and accountability
      from the institutional powers. Without which, the status quo remains.


      Our country has a rich history of forced removal of children from families. In
      essence, this is exactly who we are. This is who we have always been.


      Sometimes our most well-intentioned voices are misinformed or can have unintended
      consequences. Under the guise of solidarity with immigrant children and their
      families, I witness well-meaning yet misguided white people, from Khloe Kardashian
      to politicians and activists state “this is not who we are” as a country. Activists
      pushed back to remind us that our country has a legacy of family separation as
      far back as the transatlantic slave trade and extended to indigenous people and
      interned Japanese Americans. It has been stated by activists and academics that
      family separation is a tool that is a common practice of colonizers. Our country
      has a rich history of forced removal of children from families. In essence, this
      is exactly who we are. This is who we have always been. Similarly, in another
      attempt to show solidarity, white people will claim that we are a “land of immigrants.”
      That, too, is a misnomer that erases our country’s history and the impact of colonization
      on indigenous peoples. We are a nation of colonizers. Settler colonialism has
      never left the psyches of the white ruling elite and has only evolved.


      I reconnected with a friend from my hometown on social media. We hadn’t spoken
      in more than a decade. He casually stated that he moved from there because it
      had been, in fact, invaded. What he alluded to was an influx of immigrants. I
      sat with this comment and felt emotions wash over me. He used racially coded language
      to describe his experience of being threatened by the mere presence of immigrants
      who were undoubtedly from south of the border. As a white cisgender heterosexual
      man, he embodies all characteristics of privilege, and any form of privilege results
      in entitlement, the belief that one is deserving of special privileges or treatment.
      As such, he felt entitled to claim that his rightful space has been encroached
      upon by the “other.” His actions were not unique, and were indicative of a norm
      for white people. It is within this interaction—coupled with the ongoing revelation
      of the atrocities and human rights violations at the border—that provoked me to
      explore the link between socialization into whiteness and our ongoing entitlement
      to land and place. As such, this not only causes reactionary and inflammatory
      responses, such as my friend’s, but also underpins family separation and other
      inhumane policies at the border.


      According to Robin D’Angelo:


      white people in North America live in a social environment that protects and insulates
      them from race-based stress. This insulated environment of racial protection builds
      white expectations for racial comfort while at the same time lowering the ability
      to tolerate racial stress, leading to what I refer to as White Fragility. White
      Fragility is a state in which even a minimum amount of racial stress becomes intolerable,
      triggering a range of defensive moves.


      In a culture where whiteness sits atop the social hierarchy, the benefits include
      an assumption of racial superiority and right to racial comfort. As such, when
      our sense of racial comfort and superiority is ruptured and racial stressors take
      hold, it evokes a response. This can include, but is not limited to, a fight or
      flight response.


      The viewpoint held by my friend, who undoubtedly would never believe that he held
      racist ideology, undergirds what has driven white people to take action to preserve
      racial comfort when feeling our space is threatened by the “other.” In his instance,
      and for generations before him, the desire for racial dominance and segregation
      has translated into the all too common practice of white flight, paired with a
      sense of entitlement to space. White people, even the allegedly “good” northerners,
      have historically adopted and practiced behaviors to ensure racial segregation.
      As D’Angelo states, we move through life to protect our perceived entitlement
      to racial comfort, and leading segregated lives is one tool we use. We choose
      “good” neighborhoods and “good” schools, implicit in this choice is that “good”
      is code language for white. Thus, we make explicit and implicit choices to surround
      ourselves in whiteness. As the community integrates, fleeing one’s neighborhood
      in search of white homogeneity and dominance is a strategy that white people have
      employed for generations.


      The entitlement that my friend felt so deeply is congruent with the mentality
      of the Trump administration. This administration desires to maintain white racial
      dominance in this country, and are using violent tactics to do so. This could
      be characterized as a “fight” response to ensuring our right to place and racial
      comfort. Rather than fleeing racially mixed neighborhoods in search of homogeneity,
      the ruling white elite manufactures harsh immigration policies. Furthermore, the
      violent tactics used vis a vis vigilantes, border patrol agents, and detention
      centers, all require an element of violence to maintain dominance over the space
      at the southern border. Family separation, killings, drugging and physically and
      sexually assaulting children, are all familiar tactics used by those who wish
      to dominate. The extension and enhancement of the brutal policies aimed at immigrants
      by the Trump administration signals that there is an unabashed desire to fight.
      The “fight” response that our government employs with its border policies is obviously
      unjust, and many white people have expressed their outrage. But the “flight” response
      that white people engage in with our choices of where to live and when to move
      are an insidious side of the same coin: white people continue to hold the bulk
      of power and resources and to benefit from that power, to the detriment of people
      of color. The “fight” that the state is perpetuating against immigrants is not
      new, and part of a legacy of settler colonialism.


      A definition of settler colonialism is that it is a distinct type of colonialism
      that functions through the replacement of indigenous populations with an invasive
      settler society that, over time, develops a distinctive identity and sovereignty.
      This form of colonialism presumes that the colonizer intends to stay and maintain
      dominance over the existing peoples and land. This dominance is carried out through
      various forms of violence, plunder, displacement, policies, laws, and production
      of racist propaganda that promotes dominant cultural narratives of superiority
      of the settler. As settler colonizers aimed to expand westward, they justified
      the expansion by a philosophy known as manifest destiny. Manifest destiny is the
      ideology that the creation of the United States was inevitable and part of God’s
      plan. This 19th century propaganda was used to justify intentional genocide, enslavement,
      and cultural erasure. The forced displacement of indigenous people, land grabs,
      treaties, and wars with Mexico stole land from indigenous people and created our
      southern border. Racist tropes of indigenous people, Africans, and other people
      of color, got their origins from early colonizers and continued to hold throughout
      the centuries. Since the beginning of colonization, this country was rooted in
      the creation of a superior (white) class who dominated and dehumanized the “other”
      to maintain control over land, resources, property, and wealth. We manufactured
      borders as a result of our ancestral desires to conquer land and people for wealth
      and natural resources. We continue to fight to maintain dominance for these reasons.


      For white people, we have a legacy of weaponizing our white privilege through
      our reaction to a perceived threat from the “other.” This is illustrated through
      acts such as calling the police on Black people who are going about daily activities,
      violently defending one’s neighborhood from integration, or using political and
      violent means to prevent school desegregation. In all instances, there is an expectation
      to be treated as the victim. Part of the consequence of our socialization as white
      people is that we lose a piece of ourselves. That is, our humanity is lost—an
      ability to embody human connection and empathy that translates to actions that
      lift up others who do not look like us. Our intimate connection to humans and
      the earth is forfeited so we receive the illusion of superiority. The absence
      creates a void that we search to fill. Our disconnection to ourselves and others,
      combined with state power, is a recipe that allows for policies and actions that
      support white supremacy, as illustrated by the violent conditions at the border,
      and beyond.


      In present day, racist narratives to promote white superiority and entitlement
      have remained unchanged, only the language has shifted. Racially coded language
      is the acceptable norm and it achieves the same outcome of “manifest destiny.”
      Reinforcing stereotypes and reproduction of harmful messages indoctrinate us into
      a culture of believing that there always will be the scary, vile, and undeserving
      “other” who must be controlled, conquered, or exploited. From “welfare queen”
      to “terrorist” to “illegals” to “thug,” these are all terms used to dehumanize
      the “other” and give us, white people, a sense of our own superiority. Our internalized
      presumption of superiority is an extension of a historical settler colonialist
      legacy of belonging here above anyone else. That our belonging over all others
      must be protected by documentation, borders, a wall, surveillance, and a Muslim
      ban.


      This attitude of entitlement is an extension of white privilege, rooted in our
      legacy of settler colonialism. Our settler colonialist mentality instructs that
      only if the “other” is excluded from our rightful place, then life’s struggles
      will disappear. If not for the “other” we would have security, employment, good
      schools, healthcare, and social services will only go to the deserving, hard working,
      white people. Politicians thrive on exploiting the fears and anxieties that white
      workers have about our own survival in a capitalist society that has increased
      wealth for the top earners while squeezing out the rest of us.


      When we feel resources are scarce, when our survival is threatened, we search
      for answers to why we are struggling—and who’s to blame. We blame the “other.”
      It is up to us to release ourselves from the constraints of our settler colonialist
      mentality. If we want to achieve a better quality of life, and to truly be liberated,
      we must recognize the ways we facilitate oppression even as we condemn the more
      obviously egregious examples of that same oppression. We must act together, in
      solidarity, with all oppressed people.

    paragraph_summary: The article reflects on the recent outrage among many white Americans
      regarding U.S. Customs and Border Protection's policies, particularly the separation
      of families and the treatment of asylum seekers at the southern border. This reaction
      indicates a newfound awareness among some white individuals about the historical
      injustices tied to family separation, which has roots in the legacy of colonization
      and systemic racism in the U.S. The authors argue that despite the outrage, many
      well-meaning white people misunderstand the country's history, often claiming,
      "this is not who we are," while ignoring the long-standing practices of family
      separation and racial dominance. They discuss how white privilege and entitlement
      manifest in societal behaviors, such as white flight and the maintenance of racial
      segregation, which are linked to a broader system of settler colonialism. The
      piece calls for a deeper understanding of these dynamics and urges white individuals
      to confront their complicity in systemic oppression, advocating for solidarity
      with all marginalized communities to foster genuine change.

  - title: Is Trump Reversing FDR's New Deal?
    url: https://www.laprogressive.com/author/richard-d-wolff/progressive-issues/trump-reversing-fdrs-new-deal
    text: 'There lie certain similarities with what Trump faced when he took office
      in 2025. In both cases, the employer class felt deeply threatened, especially
      due to the escalation of the political and economic dangers.


      After the end of World War II, the U.S. employer class—the capitalists—faced overlapping
      threats, both domestic and foreign. On the domestic side, a coalition of the Congress
      of Industrial Organizations (CIO), two socialist parties, and a communist party
      had grown large and powerful during the 1930s Great Depression. Together, they
      pushed hard and successfully for domestic policies collectively known as the New
      Deal.


      These policies included the establishment of the Social Security system, the unemployment
      compensation system, the nation’s first minimum wage, and a federal jobs program
      that employed millions. Along with several other programs, the New Deal represented
      a leftward shift of state priorities. For the employer class, worse than those
      spending shifts were the corresponding changes in federal revenue sources.


      Sharply raised taxes on (and borrowing from) corporations and the rich funded
      the New Deal’s massive program for the employees. This reallocated the nation’s
      income and wealth from the top to the middle and bottom. As against the dominant
      trickle-down economic policies that were in place before and soon after it, the
      New Deal represented an experiment in trickle-up economic policies. Once World
      War II was over, the employer class wanted nothing more than to undo the New Deal,
      and to bring back trickle-down polices.


      A second domestic problem threatened the U.S. economy after 1945: the risk of
      backsliding into depression. Five years of huge wartime deficit finance finally
      lifted the U.S. economy out of the 1930s depression. When 1945 put demobilization
      of troops and redeployment of resources to peacetime production on the agenda,
      it also provoked fears of a reversion to depression. Leading U.S. politicians
      and academics, more or less influenced by Keynes’s work, looked urgently to government
      interventions to prevent that.


      The U.S. employer class also perceived foreign threats. Chief among these was
      the USSR, the wartime ally of the United States. In service to the U.S. employer
      class, President Harry S. Truman (1945-1953) transformed perceptions about the
      USSR from a close wartime ally into a fearsome enemy bent on “overthrowing the
      U.S. by force and violence.” Despite having suffered enormous wartime destruction,
      the USSR was quickly rebranded by U.S. mainstream politicians, media, business,
      and academic leaders as an extreme danger. Communists and their “fellow travelers”
      were notoriously purged by what has ever since been called McCarthyism.


      Western European leaders also feared and turned against the USSR as Europe’s eastern
      countries became the USSR’s postwar socialist allies. These countries also became
      closer to the USSR as it supported and assisted successful revolutions against
      an already weakened European colonialism. At the same time, Europe’s employer
      classes acutely feared their domestic communist parties that were by then strongly
      entrenched in their anti-Nazi resistance movements and organized labor movements.
      The 1930s depression strengthened them all (as it had in the United States).


      In Europe, labor movements, communist and socialist parties, and many of their
      supporters mobilized, trained, equipped, funded, and coordinated several anti-fascist
      resistances. By 1945, that resistance work led to the immense popularity of these
      parties and movements. Western European employers in each country feared the economic
      demands their domestic socialists, communists, and labor unions would make. Those
      demands would be backed by their workers’ domestic political power and gain more
      support due to the USSR’s geopolitical proximity.


      These conditions in the United States and Western Europe resulted in a shared
      commitment by their capitalist classes, leading to an alliance, which would embrace
      U.S. dominance—defined as “free-world leadership”—in military matters and in mobilizing
      resources internationally against the USSR (NATO, IMF, and World Bank). The employer
      class in each of these countries focused their resources, along with those of
      their governments, to purge communists, socialists, labor militants, and their
      supporters as thoroughly as conditions allowed. The actions ranged from imprisonment
      and deportation to loss of jobs, income, and social influence.


      The alliance’s central theme was to declare and wage a Cold War against both the
      USSR and its “agents” inside the United States and European countries. The purges
      inside the United States included the executions of Ethel and Julius Rosenberg
      as Soviet spies. Those actions also entailed loudly favoring (and secret CIA funding)
      many of Europe’s “pro-Western” politicians and parties, media outlets, and student
      groups. The U.S.-European alliance added Canada and Japan to their bloc. The U.S.
      dollar and its global position lubricated everything this alliance was and did.


      The central ideological and political problem for the U.S. employer class after
      1945 was how to accomplish the undoing of the New Deal and the United States’
      wartime alliance with the USSR. The solution it found was a well-coordinated,
      well-funded campaign featuring cohesive arguments articulated by institutions
      that could saturate global public opinion. Nothing less than a total turnaround
      in public opinion and policy would rescue U.S. capitalism from what its employer
      class saw as an existential crisis.


      There lie certain similarities with what Trump faced when he took office in 2025.
      In both cases, the employer class felt deeply threatened, especially due to the
      escalation of the political and economic dangers. Today, that class worries about
      crippling social divisions and tensions. The deepening inequalities of the distributions
      of income, wealth, and political influence have caused the promised American dream
      to be out of reach for the majority, which has angered them.


      The employer class also fears the deepening indebtedness of its government, its
      corporate sector, and the majority of households amid the worrisome decline of
      the nation’s geopolitical position. China’s growth over recent decades positions
      it as the first serious global economiccompetitor of the United States in a century
      (the USSR was too small an economy to ever achieve this status). Among the many
      consequences of China’s growth, the fading global position of the U.S. dollar
      ranks high. As in the case of Truman taking power in 1945, Trump’s second term
      is also defined by heavy cumulated pressures prioritizing breaking from dangerous
      and declining situations.


      The U.S. employer class’s solution in 1945 was to destroy the domestic left and
      transform the USSR from ally to enemy. Trump’s solution for the employer class
      is similarly to try to destroy the left but to transform Russia from an enemy
      to an ally. Despite important differences in time and global conditions—the United
      States left in 1945 was far more radical than it became later and is now—the similarities
      here are suggestive. In 1945, employers commenced undoing the New Deal. They eventually
      succeeded, but only partly. They managed an upward redistributive state, but they
      had to accept the shift to a regulatory state. Today, Trump seeks to complete
      burying the New Deal legacy by going further and undoing the regulatory state.


      The class politics of Trump carry forward the actions of his predecessors across
      the last century. The details, not the goals, vary with the circumstances. The
      transition from the USSR to Russia facilitated Trump’s changed policy stance toward
      the country. The decline of the United States’ organized labor movement over the
      last 70 years facilitated Trump’s electoral appeal to the employee class. On the
      other hand, China’s continuing rise as an economic competitor reinforces the employer
      class’s worries about its status and security. More deeply, what disturbs the
      U.S. employer class now is the intertwined decline of the U.S. empire and the
      U.S. capitalism’s global position.


      After 1945, the employer class reasserted its social dominance. It refocused the
      federal government on the twin tasks of purging supporters of the New Deal from
      the government, unions, and other social institutions and demonizing and containing
      the USSR as the evil global enemy. Anti-communism became the main ideological
      weapon to achieve this. The purge demanded that all those who supported the deal
      not only denounce communism but also show sympathy to such dogmas as “state interference
      in the economy” is inefficient, wasteful, and inferior to what private “free”
      enterprises could and would achieve.


      Communists, socialists, unionists, liberals, Democrats, and others associated
      with the New Deal got purged as believers in bureaucracy, authoritarianism, and
      totalitarianism. At best, they were seen as agents of Moscow’s crusades against
      democracy and individual liberty. Putting domestic communists first among its
      targets let the employer class link the domestic purge quickly and seamlessly
      with the Cold War struggles against the USSR. These actions against communists
      at home while waging the Cold War abroad aimed to defeat two evils at the same
      time.


      Over the last 80 years, the employer class, directly and through its power over
      governments, undertook a massive program of ideological change. It made the struggle
      between more versus less government intervention in the “private enterprise economy”
      and “the free market” an important issue in economics and public policy. Professional
      economists debated between Keynesianism and neoclassicism. Moderate politicians
      rallied around slogans that defined the struggle as being between “meeting people’s
      needs” versus suffering a “authoritarian bureaucracy.” Extremist politicians called
      the state evil (often using communist, socialist, liberal, Democrat, and even
      terrorist as synonyms).


      The global “free market” established after 1945 enabled the United States, which
      became dominant after the wartime destruction of all potential economic rivals
      (Japan, Germany, Britain, France, Russia, and Italy), to sustain that position
      through NATO on the one hand and demonizing the USSR on the other. Fighting communism
      abroad justified sustaining that dominance. Fighting communism at home justified
      destroying the New Deal coalition and thereby undoing the policy.


      Cold War leaders in the United States, representing both major political parties,
      carried out these policies consistently. The Heritage Foundation’s 2025 report
      updates and expands them into a plan that Trump’s regime is largely following.
      That plan targets what little remains of the New Deal: removing “regulatory” state
      apparatuses. Trump’s regime also accepts implicitly what it denies explicitly:
      that the U.S. empire and U.S. capitalism are in decline.


      Tariffs are the magic bullet to reverse all that and fast. Above all, they are
      implemented with the hope that they will return manufacturing to the United States.
      (This was promised by each of the presidents this century, but none of them delivered
      on it.) The tariffs might, at best, slow the decline, but their political, economic,
      and ideological costs and the retaliations by many nations will make the magic
      bullet fail. Much the same happened to many empires earlier that failed to stop
      their decline with their magic bullets. Tariffs will likely function much like
      the proposal of “taking back” the Panama Canal or Greenland and loudly squeezing
      symbolic gains from Canada and Mexico. These plans are aggressive disguises and
      over-advertised offsets for the painful reality of the declining empire and economy.


      It is worth remembering that in all empires, when their rise inevitably turns
      into decline, those who accumulated the greatest wealth and power use these resources
      to retain their position. They thereby offload the costs of decline onto the middle
      and lower classes. The latter suffer more and face the consequences first. Trump’s
      first budget proposals starkly exhibit this offloading. For most empires, such
      offloading proves socially divisive and ends very badly.


      Recent national election results in Canada and Australia suggest that those classes
      are beginning to grasp the Trump regime’s larger goals and have voted against
      politicians seen to be insufficiently opposed to them. Some polls in the United
      States point in similar directions. Europe’s leaders are worried too. Most of
      them have been long and deeply complicit with the United States’ goals and methods.
      Voters may punish them for failure to resist the repeated anti-European policies
      and attitudes flowing from the Trump regime. European leaders risk voters finding
      them guilty by association. So many break away from Trump by exaggerating support
      for Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Ukraine and demonizing Russia.


      The roots of resistance expand and deepen.

      New Deal.
    paragraph_summary: The article draws parallels between the challenges faced by the
      U.S. employer class after World War II and those encountered during Donald Trump's
      presidency beginning in 2025. After WWII, the employer class felt threatened by
      the rise of labor movements and the New Deal policies that redistributed wealth
      and power, prompting a concerted effort to dismantle these changes and rebrand
      the USSR from ally to enemy. Similarly, Trump's administration reflects a response
      to perceived threats from social divisions, economic inequality, and the rise
      of China as a global competitor, leading to efforts to undermine leftist movements
      and regulatory frameworks established during the New Deal. The article argues
      that both eras are marked by a struggle for the employer class to maintain dominance
      amid declining geopolitical and economic positions, employing tactics such as
      tariffs and ideological campaigns against communism to consolidate power and offload
      the costs of decline onto the middle and lower classes. As resistance to these
      policies grows, the article suggests that the political landscape may shift, with
      voters increasingly aware of the broader implications of the employer class's
      strategies.

  - title: How Far The Fascist Analogy Works
    url: https://www.laprogressive.com/author/richard-d-wolff/progressive-issues/fascist-analogy
    text: 'In the short period from1918 to the 1930s, the German working class suffered
      three historic traumas. Germany lost a devastating world war and thus its colonies,
      suffered one of the world’s worst inflations, and then crashed into the Great
      Depression. Nothing in the prior century had prepared Germany’s working class
      for the sudden losses of life, of physical and mental health, of family savings,
      and of jobs and careers that those traumas entailed. Quite the contrary, its 19th
      century had seen a political unification and a rapid industrialization that had
      made Germany a global competitor of the United States. Indeed, the two nations
      were the great challengers of the British Empire.


      From the peaks of prosperity, growth, self-confidence and brilliant future prospects,
      Germany collapsed into poverty, immense debt and reparations. Unemployment in
      1919 was around 2.9% while by 1923 it had risen to 28.2% and in 1932 it was 29.9%.
      The traditional German center-right governments were widely blamed for failing
      to prepare for and perform better during World War 1. The traditional center-left
      governments were blamed for the failings of the subsequent Weimar period. Opportunities
      opened for demagogues who could plausibly provide sympathy and real support to
      the traumatized masses. To succeed, such demagogues would also have to designate
      plausible scapegoats for the accumulated German anger over the collapse of its
      global position and self-esteem. Hitler and fascism found their historical moment.


      Over the longer period from the 1970s to 2010, a somewhat parallel trauma afflicted
      the US working class and especially the better paid, unionized, white male component
      concentrated in manufacturing jobs. From the depths of depression in the 1930s,
      that component had emerged from World War 2 to enjoy 4 decades of exceptional
      well-being and prosperity. In part because those decades also saw the US empire
      rise to its peak, unionized workers could lead the way for much of the working
      class to obtain regular annual rituals of rising real wages. An “American Dream”
      (individual house for parents and children, car, TV, summer vacation, college
      education for children) became affordable for millions of workers. Politicians,
      mass media and academia congealed into a patriotic celebratory chorus. It renamed
      those millions a “middle class” that anchored a “free society” exceptionally entitled
      to lead the “free world” and thereby replicate everywhere what the US had pioneered.


      As Germany’s rise before World War 1 had set the stage for its working class’s
      post-war collapse and associated trauma, so the US’s post World War 2 rise set
      the stage for the its working class’s trauma since the 1970s. Three factors combined
      then to destroy the jobs and incomes of especially the white, manufacturing, largely
      unionized, male workers. The first was technology (computers, then robotics, and
      now AI); automation accelerated. The second was the relocation of manufacturing
      jobs overseas aimed at profiting there because wages were far lower and market
      growth far faster. Finally, the third was immigration as immigrants offered to
      work for less wages and under poorer working conditions than what native workers
      were willing to accept.


      A few of those displaced by these three factors found other jobs and ways to live
      at the levels they had reached before, but most did not. The latter became sick,
      depressed, unemployed, home-bound, divorced, addicted, and/or took part and full-time
      service sector jobs much less well paid. They tended to blame themselves personally
      and individually for their deteriorated economic situation and its side-effects.
      Partly this reflected the US’s deeply-rooted individualist ideology. However it
      also reflected the then socially dominant celebration of technology, globalization,
      and neo-liberalism broadly. They were said to deliver prosperity to those able
      to grasp their vast opportunities for personal progress. Thus, their self-esteem
      gave way to bitterness, resentment, and anger as the American Dream slipped ever
      further out of their reach.


      Neither the Republican Party nor the Democratic Party sympathized much with, let
      alone helped, this traumatized working class. Instead, the two parties’ traditional
      centrist leaderships competed to celebrate neo-liberal globalization, pander to
      its major corporate leaders, and increasingly depend on large donations from them.
      The sufferings of those damaged by automation, job off-shoring, and immigration
      became invisible to and in polite society. That only deepened social divisions.
      On one side were those who accepted and repeated the neo-liberal, globalizing
      story. They “saw” the US as a “healthy economy and society.” The other side ”saw”
      themselves as the sacrificial victims of a deeply unfair economic program favoring
      wealthy urban, coastal elites.


      The political stage was thus set for a demagogic entrant to proclaim himself as
      the one to reverse key components of post-1970s history and thus make America
      great again. He would offer sympathy and compassion for the injustices suffered
      by the white working class. He would bring back manufacturing jobs. He would stop
      immigration and deport immigrants. He would defeat the coastal liberal centrists:
      first those controlling the Republican and then also those controlling the Democratic
      parties. Once President he would punish all those foreigners who had cheated the
      US economically with the complicity of coastal elites. Those Democrats who had
      enabled those foreigners to do so much damage would be defeated as Trump would
      lead the country in committing all public policy to America First.


      With the background of Trumpism to date and its German predecessor, the mobilization
      of a paramilitary ICE to enact and limelight the deportation theater and of the
      California national guard to back up ICE brings the fascism specter another step
      closer. Nazis had mobilized several paramilitary formations and targeted them
      against Communists, Socialists, and Jews. Hitler had also threatened to reverse
      Germany’s loss of its colonies after World War 1. He had eventually “taken” lands
      neighboring Germany. Trump threatens to take Panama, Greenland, and Canada.


      Trump’s “big, beautiful” tax bill exhibits his service to corporations and the
      rich. It not only extends their massive tax cuts from Trump’s first presidency.
      It adds further tax cuts and at least nods toward paying for them less by borrowing
      and instead more by extreme austerity: savagely cutting federal programs and payrolls.
      Massive deregulation of markets and business practices favors employer profiteering
      directly and, by ending protections for employees and consumers, also indirectly.


      The huge difference that remains and separates Hitler’s Nazism from anything happening
      today is the 1929 collapse of global capitalism. That brought fascism to power
      in Germany. The 1930s Depression then shaped German fascism’s evolution in the
      6 years before war subordinated everything to its imperatives after 1939. Defeat
      in war ended German fascism in 1944. The currently intertwined declines of the
      post-1945 American empire and US capitalism provide a different context for Trumpism
      - so far - than what the Great Depression provided for Nazism.


      Hitler took power when the communist and socialist left had together built socially
      influential and politically powerful organizations. They seriously contested power
      at the ballot box and in the streets against the Nazis. The political center could
      not hold. The corporate elite feared for its survival, feared the left parties,
      and so opted to ally with Hitler given the German election results in 1932. From
      the beginning, German fascism represented a tight alliance of partners who desperately
      felt and embraced their need for one another. The capitalists needed massive governmental
      support to overcome and survive the Great Depression economically plus they needed
      a mass-based political party for political support. The NAZIs needed to gather
      the funds and institutional support that German capitalists could offer.


      That is not yet the situation in the US. Ironically, the left in the US, while
      numerous, is badly disorganized. 70 years of Cold War purges, McCarthyism, and
      their conjoint legacies had devastating effects. In those years, the US right
      enlisted US liberals in a vast campaign called “anti-communism” but that was actually
      anti-much else on the left as well. That campaign split the liberals against the
      left. Nothing equivalent happened on the right. Thus when the center-right (e.g.
      Bushes) became far-right “authoritarianism” (Trump), the split liberal/left twice
      failed to mount an effective opposition. To date, therefore, Trump has not yet
      needed to do what Hitler did: arrest, draft, imprison and kill his opponents first
      on a massive national scale and then continentally.


      What matters most now is how US capitalism continues to decline. That will be
      overdetermined especially by its own accumulated contradictions, the fading of
      its empire amid endless wars, and the competition from China and the BRICS alliance.
      The left will need to watch carefully to see if elements emerge that could bring
      a fascism fully into power. The left will need to rethink its own history and
      complicity in enabling a Trump to take power. And it will need honestly to rethink
      its divisions and their costs. A new US left – one that accepts and openly acknowledges
      the internal differences within its unity – could offer a powerful unified left
      alternative. That would radically transform US politics in ways that the absence
      of such a unified left made impossible after 1945.

      to the American working class's decline from the 1970s, particularly among white,

      outsourcing, and immigration. This decline has fostered feelings of resentment
      and bitterness, as the American Dream became increasingly unattainable, while
      both major political parties largely ignored their struggles. The article warns
      of the potential for a rise in authoritarianism, exemplified by Trumpism, and
      highlights the disorganization of the left in the U.S. as a barrier to effective
      opposition against such movements. It calls for a rethinking of the left's history
      and divisions to create a unified front capable of challenging the current political
      landscape and preventing the emergence of fascism.

  - title: Trump is Trying to Reverse the New Deal
    url: https://www.counterpunch.org/2025/05/20/trump-is-trying-to-reverse-the-new-deal/
    text: 'After the end of World War II, the U.S. employer class—the capitalists—faced
      overlapping threats, both domestic and foreign. On the domestic side, a coalition
      of the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO), two socialist parties, and
      a communist party had grown large and powerful during the 1930s Great Depression.
      Together, they pushed hard and successfully for domestic policies collectively
      known as the New Deal.


      These policies included the establishment of the Social Security system, the unemployment
      compensation system, the nation’s first minimum wage, and a federal jobs program
      that employed millions. Along with several other programs, the New Deal represented
      a leftward shift of state priorities. For the employer class, worse than those
      spending shifts were the corresponding changes in federal revenue sources.


      Sharply raised taxes on (and borrowing from) corporations and the rich funded
      the New Deal’s massive program for the employees. This reallocated the nation’s
      income and wealth from the top to the middle and bottom. As against the dominant
      trickle-down economic policies that were in place before and soon after it, the
      New Deal represented an experiment in trickle-up economic policies. Once World
      War II was over, the employer class wanted nothing more than to undo the New Deal,
      and to bring back trickle-down polices.


      A second domestic problem threatened the U.S. economy after 1945: the risk of
      backsliding into depression. Five years of huge wartime deficit finance finally
      lifted the U.S. economy out of the 1930s depression. When 1945 put demobilization
      of troops and redeployment of resources to peacetime production on the agenda,
      it also provoked fears of a reversion to depression. Leading U.S. politicians
      and academics, more or less influenced by Keynes’s work, looked urgently to government
      interventions to prevent that.


      The U.S. employer class also perceived foreign threats. Chief among these was
      the USSR, the wartime ally of the United States. In service to the U.S. employer
      class, President Harry S. Truman (1945-1953) transformed perceptions about the
      USSR from a close wartime ally into a fearsome enemy bent on “overthrowing the
      U.S. by force and violence.” Despite having suffered enormous wartime destruction,
      the USSR was quickly rebranded by U.S. mainstream politicians, media, business,
      and academic leaders as an extreme danger. Communists and their “fellow travelers”
      were notoriously purged by what has ever since been called McCarthyism.


      Western European leaders also feared and turned against the USSR as Europe’s eastern
      countries became the USSR’s postwar socialist allies. These countries also became
      closer to the USSR as it supported and assisted successful revolutions against
      an already weakened European colonialism. At the same time, Europe’s employer
      classes acutely feared their domestic communist parties that were by then strongly
      entrenched in their anti-Nazi resistance movements and organized labor movements.
      The 1930s depression strengthened them all (as it had in the United States).


      In Europe, labor movements, communist and socialist parties, and many of their
      supporters mobilized, trained, equipped, funded, and coordinated several anti-fascist
      resistances. By 1945, that resistance work led to the immense popularity of these
      parties and movements. Western European employers in each country feared the economic
      demands their domestic socialists, communists, and labor unions would make. Those
      demands would be backed by their workers’ domestic political power and gain more
      support due to the USSR’s geopolitical proximity.


      These conditions in the United States and Western Europe resulted in a shared
      commitment by their capitalist classes, leading to an alliance, which would embrace
      U.S. dominance—defined as “free-world leadership”—in military matters and in mobilizing
      resources internationally against the USSR (NATO, IMF, and World Bank). The employer
      class in each of these countries focused their resources, along with those of
      their governments, to purge communists, socialists, labor militants, and their
      supporters as thoroughly as conditions allowed. The actions ranged from imprisonment
      and deportation to loss of jobs, income, and social influence.


      The alliance’s central theme was to declare and wage a Cold War against both the
      USSR and its “agents” inside the United States and European countries. The purges
      inside the United States included the executions of Ethel and Julius Rosenberg
      as Soviet spies. Those actions also entailed loudly favoring (and secret CIA funding)
      many of Europe’s “pro-Western” politicians and parties, media outlets, and student
      groups. The U.S.-European alliance added Canada and Japan to their bloc. The U.S.
      dollar and its global position lubricated everything this alliance was and did.


      The central ideological and political problem for the U.S. employer class after
      1945 was how to accomplish the undoing of the New Deal and the United States’
      wartime alliance with the USSR. The solution it found was a well-coordinated,
      well-funded campaign featuring cohesive arguments articulated by institutions
      that could saturate global public opinion. Nothing less than a total turnaround
      in public opinion and policy would rescue U.S. capitalism from what its employer
      class saw as an existential crisis.


      There lie certain similarities with what Trump faced when he took office in 2025.
      In both cases, the employer class felt deeply threatened, especially due to the
      escalation of the political and economic dangers. Today, that class worries about
      crippling social divisions and tensions. The deepening inequalities of the distributions
      of income, wealth, and political influence have caused the promised American dream
      to be out of reach for the majority, which has angered them.


      The employer class also fears the deepening indebtedness of its government, its
      corporate sector, and the majority of households amid the worrisome decline of
      the nation’s geopolitical position. China’s growth over recent decades positions
      it as the first serious global economic competitor of the United States in a century
      (the USSR was too small an economy to ever achieve this status). Among the many
      consequences of China’s growth, the fading global position of the U.S. dollar
      ranks high. As in the case of Truman taking power in 1945, Trump’s second term
      is also defined by heavy cumulated pressures prioritizing breaking from dangerous
      and declining situations.


      The U.S. employer class’s solution in 1945 was to destroy the domestic left and
      transform the USSR from ally to enemy. Trump’s solution for the employer class
      is similarly to try to destroy the left but to transform Russia from an enemy
      to an ally. Despite important differences in time and global conditions—the United
      States left in 1945 was far more radical than it became later and is now—the similarities
      here are suggestive. In 1945, employers commenced undoing the New Deal. They eventually
      succeeded, but only partly. They managed an upward redistributive state, but they
      had to accept the shift to a regulatory state. Today, Trump seeks to complete
      burying the New Deal legacy by going further and undoing the regulatory state.


      The class politics of Trump carry forward the actions of his predecessors across
      the last century. The details, not the goals, vary with the circumstances. The
      transition from the USSR to Russia facilitated Trump’s changed policy stance toward
      the country. The decline of the United States’ organized labor movement over the
      last 70 years facilitated Trump’s electoral appeal to the employee class. On the
      other hand, China’s continuing rise as an economic competitor reinforces the employer
      class’s worries about its status and security. More deeply, what disturbs the
      U.S. employer class now is the intertwined decline of the U.S. empire and the
      U.S. capitalism’s global position.


      After 1945, the employer class reasserted its social dominance. It refocused the
      federal government on the twin tasks of purging supporters of the New Deal from
      the government, unions, and other social institutions and demonizing and containing
      the USSR as the evil global enemy. Anti-communism became the main ideological
      weapon to achieve this. The purge demanded that all those who supported the deal
      not only denounce communism but also show sympathy to such dogmas as “state interference
      in the economy” is inefficient, wasteful, and inferior to what private “free”
      enterprises could and would achieve.


      Communists, socialists, unionists, liberals, Democrats, and others associated
      with the New Deal got purged as believers in bureaucracy, authoritarianism, and
      totalitarianism. At best, they were seen as agents of Moscow’s crusades against
      democracy and individual liberty. Putting domestic communists first among its
      targets let the employer class link the domestic purge quickly and seamlessly
      with the Cold War struggles against the USSR. These actions against communists
      at home while waging the Cold War abroad aimed to defeat two evils at the same
      time.


      Over the last 80 years, the employer class, directly and through its power over
      governments, undertook a massive program of ideological change. It made the struggle
      between more versus less government intervention in the “private enterprise economy”
      and “the free market” an important issue in economics and public policy. Professional
      economists debated between Keynesianism and neoclassicism. Moderate politicians
      rallied around slogans that defined the struggle as being between “meeting people’s
      needs” versus suffering a “authoritarian bureaucracy.” Extremist politicians called
      the state evil (often using communist, socialist, liberal, Democrat, and even
      terrorist as synonyms).


      The global “free market” established after 1945 enabled the United States, which
      became dominant after the wartime destruction of all potential economic rivals
      (Japan, Germany, Britain, France, Russia, and Italy), to sustain that position
      through NATO on the one hand and demonizing the USSR on the other. Fighting communism
      abroad justified sustaining that dominance. Fighting communism at home justified
      destroying the New Deal coalition and thereby undoing the policy.


      Cold War leaders in the United States, representing both major political parties,
      carried out these policies consistently. The Heritage Foundation’s 2025 report
      updates and expands them into a plan that Trump’s regime is largely following.
      That plan targets what little remains of the New Deal: removing “regulatory” state
      apparatuses. Trump’s regime also accepts implicitly what it denies explicitly:
      that the U.S. empire and U.S. capitalism are in decline.


      Tariffs are the magic bullet to reverse all that and fast. Above all, they are
      implemented with the hope that they will return manufacturing to the United States.
      (This was promised by each of the presidents this century, but none of them delivered
      on it.) The tariffs might, at best, slow the decline, but their political, economic,
      and ideological costs and the retaliations by many nations will make the magic
      bullet fail. Much the same happened to many empires earlier that failed to stop
      their decline with their magic bullets. Tariffs will likely function much like
      the proposal of “taking back” the Panama Canal or Greenland and loudly squeezing
      symbolic gains from Canada and Mexico. These plans are aggressive disguises and
      over-advertised offsets for the painful reality of the declining empire and economy.


      It is worth remembering that in all empires, when their rise inevitably turns
      into decline, those who accumulated the greatest wealth and power use these resources
      to retain their position. They thereby offload the costs of decline onto the middle
      and lower classes. The latter suffer more and face the consequences first. Trump’s
      first budget proposals starkly exhibit this offloading. For most empires, such
      offloading proves socially divisive and ends very badly.


      Recent national election results in Canada and Australia suggest that those classes
      are beginning to grasp the Trump regime’s larger goals and have voted against
      politicians seen to be insufficiently opposed to them. Some polls in the United
      States point in similar directions. Europe’s leaders are worried too. Most of
      them have been long and deeply complicit with the United States’ goals and methods.
      Voters may punish them for failure to resist the repeated anti-European policies
      and attitudes flowing from the Trump regime. European leaders risk voters finding
      them guilty by association. So many break away from Trump by exaggerating support
      for Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Ukraine and demonizing Russia.


      The roots of resistance expand and deepen.'

    paragraph_summary: After World War II, the U.S. employer class faced significant
      threats from both domestic and foreign sources, primarily from a powerful coalition
      of labor and socialist movements that had emerged during the Great Depression,
      advocating for New Deal policies that shifted wealth from the rich to the middle
      and lower classes. In response, the employer class sought to dismantle these policies
      and counter the perceived threat of communism, particularly from the USSR, which
      had transitioned from ally to enemy under President Truman. This led to a campaign
      of purging leftist elements within the U.S. and aligning with Western European
      capitalists to combat communism globally. The ideological battle framed by the
      employer class emphasized anti-communism and the promotion of free-market principles,
      ultimately aiming to restore trickle-down economics and diminish the regulatory
      state established during the New Deal. In contemporary times, parallels are drawn
      with Trump's administration, which similarly seeks to dismantle remaining New
      Deal legacies while addressing fears of economic decline and rising competition
      from China, all while navigating deepening social divisions and potential voter
      backlash against perceived anti-democratic policies.

    url: https://www.counterpunch.org/2025/02/28/a-cruel-hoax-the-political-economy-of-anti-immigration/
    text: 'Deporting immigrants may deliver electoral wins to politicians if voters
      have been sufficiently cultivated by years of demonizing and scapegoating them.
      For its victims, the cruelties involved are horrific. Yet such deportation makes
      little sense economically. It represents a nationally self-destructive program
      based on a faulty grasp of immigration economics. What once “made America great”
      (at least for the majority white population) were its successive waves of immigrants.
      What underscored the American economy’s strength was its ability to absorb and
      integrate those waves despite frictions among them: a genuinely productive melting
      pot. My American schooling through my PhD stressed such points.


      What then reversed such a positive understanding of immigration? What converted
      immigration instead into an urgent danger to American greatness? What lets Trump
      pose as “protecting” us by sharply reducing immigration and massively deporting
      immigrants? (By “immigrants” I mean the vast majority of people who are poor and
      join the working class at low levels of pay. Foreign-born U.S. residents comprise
      about 14 percent of the total population or roughly 46 million. About 12 million
      of them are undocumented.)


      Answers to such questions lie in the political economy of immigration. Yet those
      answers and the political economy that generates them are stunningly absent from
      popular debates and consciousness. The Republican party’s recent years of anti-immigration
      rhetoric plus the immigrant deportation policies in place across the last three
      presidencies illustrate that absence. Many politicians from both the Republican
      and Democratic parties support deportation as the necessary response to the “costly
      invasions” of immigrants (often equated to criminals). Yet evidence for this demonization
      program has been very scarce. Its proponents seem largely ignorant of the actual
      economics of immigration.


      Most immigrants coming to the United States are young adults. The young can best
      manage migration’s hardships and dangers. They can most readily fill the hardest
      jobs at the lowest pay that their desperate and vulnerable circumstances force
      on them. The undocumented among them are the most vulnerable. They dare not complain
      to the police or other government officials when employers take advantage of them
      and abuse them. Immigrants often send portions of their wages (“remittances”)
      back to the countries they left. Remittances help care for children, the elderly,
      and others who remained there and partially compensate those countries of origin
      for losing their emigrants’ productivity.


      Before adult immigrants arrived in the United States, their upbringing was financed
      by their countries of origin. Their families and governments spent considerable
      sums feeding, clothing, sheltering, educating, etc., them from birth to 15-18
      years of age. They “invested” in their young people but obtained little income
      from that investment because the young adults migrated to the United States. Their
      years of productivity benefited the U.S. economy, not the economy of the countries
      that invested in them.


      In contrast, people born and raised in the United States face heavy economic costs
      for the U.S. economy before they become working adults. U.S. families partly defray
      those costs (food, clothing, and shelter). The federal, state, and local governments
      defray other parts of those costs (public schooling, public services, etc.). Since
      relatively few U.S. adults emigrate, the U.S. economy reaps their adult productivity
      as a return on its investment in their upbringing. Added to that payoff, the United
      States secures the productivity of immigrants they did not invest in.


      Since many of the countries immigrants belong to are often among the poorer countries,
      the immigration of their citizens to the United States represents a subsidy from
      and by the poor nations. Migration not only reflects the international inequalities
      of global capitalism but it also worsens them. Migrants’ countries of origin lose
      the adult productivity they need most. Migration transfers those benefits to the
      rich countries that need them the least.


      That “great” American past that MAGA celebrates comprised many decades of massive
      and successive waves of immigrants. Impressive U.S. GDP growth in the 19th and
      20th centuries owed more than a little to the subsidies provided by immigrants.
      Early waves of immigrants stimulated economic growth that in turn attracted, welcomed,
      and incorporated later waves. Each immigrant wave struggled, and most of them
      eventually achieved rising wages; some even rose out of the working class to become
      employers. Immigration and growth facilitated each other in a cycle that many
      found “exceptional.”


      As each immigrant wave arrived, its members mostly endured the worst jobs and
      the lowest pay and lived in the worst housing and neighborhoods underserved by
      public services, such as inferior schools for their children. When the next wave
      arrived, its members accepted the same. The economic growth that earlier waves
      of immigrants contributed to eventually enabled their struggles for better jobs,
      pay, and housing to succeed. That growth also enabled the later waves of immigrants
      who replaced the earlier ones at the lowest rungs of the nation’s social ladder.


      Thus, almost all immigrants could reasonably foresee better years ahead. The United
      States could boast about a remarkable degree of “social mobility.” Carefully exaggerated
      by “rags to riches” fables like those in the many novels of Horatio Adler (1832–1899),
      working-class belief in social mobility served social peace and often blunted
      socialism’s appeal.


      This analysis has so far treated migration in terms of its national or macroeconomic
      effects. Migration also has microeconomic effects: its impact on the employee-employer
      relationship. Immigrants usually work for less pay than native-born employees
      will accept. Undocumented immigrants accept still less. Because immigrants can
      represent a real competitive threat, the native-born, better-paid workers can
      fear, resent, and oppose their presence. Demagogues often see opportunities to
      obtain votes by reflecting and reinforcing that resentment and opposition. If
      the migrants display “racial” differences, demagogues can integrate racism (traditional
      or new) to aggravate the competition between immigrant and native-born employees.


      Employers have often played immigrants against native-born employees and undocumented
      immigrants against both. Employers’ divide and conquer methods have prevented
      united actions by native and immigrant employees and blocked or destroyed labor
      unions and strikes. On the other hand, in recent years, significant portions of
      the U.S. labor movement have revived partly by pointedly unifying immigrant (documented
      and undocumented) and non-immigrant employees and, thereby, defeating employers.
      Not surprisingly, some employers, worried about a reviving labor movement, cultivated
      a backlash to reinforce divisions among employees. Demonization of immigration
      appealed to them. Denunciations of and demands to remove diversity, equity, and
      inclusion (DEI) commitments became popular covers for and companions to anti-immigrant
      agitation.


      In the United States, recent presidents have sought votes by using hostile words
      and actions against immigrants. Those presidents’ plans and resulting deportations
      responded to several years of large immigration. Political demagogues and racists
      played their usual roles. Trump lifted them into his campaigns and presidencies.
      His second term targets the most massive deportation in U.S. history.


      U.S. employers will regret the deportations’ reduction of profitable and low-wage
      immigrant employees (and especially undocumented employees). Of course, employers
      retain their usual alternative of automation: replacing ever more workers with
      computers, robots, and AI. Millions deprived of government jobs (via Trump, Musk,
      and DOGE) will join those technologically displaced to compete for shrinking job
      opportunities in the U.S. private sector. The Trumpian objective is a working
      class cleansed of immigrants, unions, and DEI sensitivities. It is a MAGA world
      that has successfully resubordinated most non-whites, women, immigrants, and all
      others deemed inferior by the likes of Trump and Musk, and those they select.


      Immigration always served chiefly the needs of U.S. capitalism. Migration was
      always costly, dangerous, and painful to the migrants who mostly lacked other
      ways to survive. The U.S. working class was often threatened by immigration and
      thus saw it negatively, but it lacked the political power to stop it. On the other
      hand, the working class also appreciated the survival and opportunities immigration
      offered their families and ancestors. In that way, they saw immigration positively.


      Over several recent decades, slow, uneven economic growth redistributed U.S. wealth
      and income upward. A declining U.S. empire coupled with rising global competition
      (especially from China), climate change’s mounting effects, and consequent global
      conflicts drove large migrations to the United States just as its jobs, incomes,
      and opportunities were being squeezed. Immigration’s perceived negative effects
      came to outweigh the positive ones. Enough of the U.S. working class’s sympathy
      for and appreciation of immigration declined to give right-wing demagogues their
      latest big opportunity.


      The demagogues exploited the changed conditions and attitudes of the United States
      working class to shake up U.S. politics. Daily executive orders have undone the
      formerly stable political consensus of alternating GOP and Democratic governments
      during the upswing of the U.S. empire in the 19th and 20th centuries. Since then,
      as the U.S. empire and capitalism commenced their mutually reinforcing decline,
      Republicans and Democrats turned ever more harshly on each other. Their old political
      establishment crumbled in bitter conflicts.


      Immigration became one flashpoint, one way to define a new political direction
      out of the decline that no party politician could dare admit to. Trump has so
      far best grasped the opportunity to ride an extreme position on immigration—mass
      deportation—to power. However, since it will soon become apparent that deporting
      immigrants solves little and worsens the U.S. decline, the political project’s
      prospects are dubious.


      Much the same applies to other projects envisaged by him and Elon Musk. These
      include the neocolonialist plans to take over the Panama Canal, Greenland, and
      Gaza, and make Canada the 51st state of the United States. These also include
      imposing tariffs around the world and disconnecting the United States from global
      efforts related to climate change and health initiatives (WHO). Abandoning the
      Ukraine war and shifting its costs onto the Europeans may provoke their resistance
      and reactions frustrating Trump and Musk in unanticipated ways.


      As with immigration, the political economics of other Trump-Musk projects (and
      much of Project 2025) raise similar profound questions about their logic, blind
      spots, and unintended consequences. The deep contradictions of anti-immigration—and
      other projects—are not overcome by hiding them under the veneer of slogans like
      “America First.” We continue to experience the American version of what “declining
      empire” means.'
    one_sentence_summary: The article argues that while deporting immigrants may yield
      short-term electoral gains for politicians through years of demonization, such
      policies are economically detrimental and ignore the historical contributions
      of immigrants to the American economy, highlighting a troubling shift in public
      perception and political rhetoric surrounding immigration.
    paragraph_summary: The article critiques the political and economic rationale behind
      the deportation of immigrants in the United States, arguing that such actions
      are primarily driven by politicians seeking electoral gains through the demonization
      of immigrants, rather than sound economic reasoning. It highlights the historical
      contributions of immigrants to the American economy, emphasizing that successive
      waves of immigrants have fueled growth and social mobility, despite facing significant
      hardships. The author contends that the recent anti-immigration sentiment, particularly
      under the Trump administration, reflects a misunderstanding of immigration economics
      and serves to distract from broader issues of economic inequality and decline.
      The article also notes that while deportation may appeal to certain political
      bases, it ultimately undermines the U.S. economy by reducing the labor force and
      exacerbating existing social tensions, suggesting that the political strategies
      surrounding immigration are fraught with contradictions and may lead to unintended
      negative consequences.

    url: https://www.counterpunch.org/2025/01/31/settler-colonialism-it-ends-with-us-in-palestine-and-israel/
    text: 'My birth emerged from European capitalism’s fascistic catastrophe in the
      1920s–1940s. That catastrophe also produced Israel’s experiment with settler colonialism
      in Palestine. This article refers to both these incidents to analyze the current
      Palestine-Israel catastrophe.


      My reasons or qualifications to write such an article start with the fact that
      my maternal grandmother and grandfather were killed at the Nazis’ Mauthausen concentration
      camp. My father’s sister was killed in Auschwitz. My mother and her sister spent
      years in different concentration camps. Because of these events, my parents fled
      Europe and started a family in the United States. Like some other descendants
      of victims who witnessed such atrocities, I have tried to understand their victimization
      and the complex effects this had on my life directly and indirectly.


      Descendants differ in their responses to what happened. Some turn inward seeking
      safety in a survival-focused disengagement from the larger world and its history.
      Some try for comfort by believing that part or all of the world has moved beyond
      the conditions that produced fascism’s victimizations. Some suffer long-simmering
      mixtures of impotence, rage, and fear that it will happen again. Among them are
      those who fight fascism wherever they see it reemerge and also those who perpetrate
      further cycles of victimization against others. Still others try to work out an
      understanding by writing articles and books.


      Israel tried to operate settler colonialism on the pattern of earlier European
      settler colonialisms established around the world. That effort linked to me indirectly
      in a remarkably personal way. Without grasping why, I chose to participate in
      a program for Harvard and Radcliffe undergraduates that took 20 of us to East
      Africa in the early 1960s as volunteers for a summer of teaching. I began to learn
      there what settler colonialism meant. Further studies grew into my doctoral dissertation
      later at Yale based on research in the records of London’s Colonial Office and
      the British Museum. My resulting book, The Economics of Colonialism: Britain and
      Kenya, 1870–1930 (New Haven, Yale University Press, 1974), tried to analyze Kenya’s
      settler colonialist economy.


      Britain had expelled the native population and reserved the nation’s fertile highlands
      for a few thousand of its white émigrés. In addition to land and police protection,
      Britain provided its émigrés with coffee seeds, transport, and a market to operate
      a Kenya-grown coffee export economy. The millions of Kenyan Blacks forcibly relocated
      into constricted reservations found them to be inadequate to sustain their lives.
      Their survival thus required them to do low-wage labor on the coffee plantations
      of the white settlers. Taxes on those low wages helped finance the British colonial
      government that enforced a ruthlessly exploitative settler colonial system. This
      economic and racialized apartness in Kenya paralleled the better-known apartheid
      in South Africa.


      Such economic systems provoke constant resistance ranging from desperate individual
      and small group acts to mass movements to organized rebellions. These acts of
      resistance occurred in Kenya, South Africa, and elsewhere too. Britain routinely
      repressed them. In Kenya, eventually, organizers gathered around Jomo Kenyatta
      and mobilized the so-called Kenya Land and Freedom Army to rebel. Their fight
      widely came to be known as the 1950s Mau Mau uprising against the British government.
      That uprising’s death counts included 63 British military officers, 33 settlers,
      more than 1,800 native policemen and auxiliary soldiers, and the widely held guesstimate
      of more than 11,000 Kenyan rebels. The British repressed the rebellion, imprisoned
      Kenyatta, and loudly declared victory.


      Britain’s victory, however, sounded the death knell for its Kenya colony. Mau
      Mau showed the British the rising levels of resistance and rebellion they would
      face indefinitely from the settler colonies they had created. British politicians
      saw these as mushrooming costs of the colonies they could not afford. Since the
      end of World War II, European colonialisms had been dissolving almost everywhere.
      British leaders could not escape accommodating the historical reality. Shortly
      after Mau Mau, Britain acknowledged Kenya’s national independence, freed Kenyatta,
      and accepted him as Kenya’s new leader. Independence ended Kenya’s settler colonialism.


      The Kenya lesson in settler colonialism deeply impacted British leaders but proved
      one that Israeli leaders refused to learn from. Given the particular histories
      of Zionism and European Jews, most Israeli leaders were determined to impose settler
      colonialism on the Palestinian people and to preserve it by force.


      Israeli leaders’ declaration of independence in May 1948 provoked immediate Palestinian
      and Arab resistance that has continued to this moment. Mass movements and broad
      rebellions have punctuated that resistance and enjoyed increasing external support
      (from Arab, Islamic, and other sources). The demise of previous European settler
      colonialisms left a legacy of immense difficulties for Israeli efforts to erect
      and sustain another.


      One crucial aspect of their response to those difficulties was to form an alliance
      with a world power that could help defend its settler colonialism. The resulting
      close alliance with the United States positioned Israel as its front-line agent
      in the Middle East, the United States’s dominant military extension to where major
      global energy resources were located. Undercutting Israel’s early socialist, collectivist,
      and kibbutzim components was facilitated by the alliance with the United States.
      Most Zionist leaders willingly paid the price of this alliance. Another price
      was Israel’s military, economic, and political dependence on the United States.
      Finally, Israeli leaders cultivated strong cultural and family connections to
      financially and politically influential partner communities inside the U.S. and
      Europe. In these ways, Israeli leaders hoped that settler colonialism might survive
      and grow despite many examples in history that proved otherwise.


      For some decades it seemed, to many inside and outside Israel, that its leaders’
      strategy and connections might secure its settler colonialism. But then what happened
      in Kenya began to repeat itself in Israel (each in different conditions). Palestinians
      resisted, mass movements followed, and finally, powerful, organized rebellions
      arose. Israeli victories over each in turn proved to be mere preludes to later,
      higher forms of opposition with ever more global support. Israeli victories resembled
      those achieved by their British counterparts in Kenya.


      It is equally clear now in Israel and Palestine that the prospect of endless warfare
      into the future is going to likely cost ever more lives and injuries, physical
      and psychical damages, and economic and political losses. The victims who survived
      Israel’s extreme violence in Gaza are already surfacing more motivated, better
      trained, and with more effective weapons to take up their fight. The children
      of those victims will likewise include many determined to end Israel’s settler
      colonialism.


      History, and now time itself, is on the Palestinians’ side. Even a staunch Israeli
      supporter like former Secretary of State Antony Blinken had to admit a stark reality
      (although he neither admitted its historic meaning nor its political implications).
      He said, “Indeed, we assess that Hamas has recruited almost as many new militants
      as it has lost. That is a recipe for an enduring insurgency and perpetual war.”


      Britain’s dying empire forced its acceptance of Kenya’s independence in 1963 and
      the end of its settler colonialism. The current decline of the United States empire
      is forcing something similar in Israel. After the latest and the worst Gaza war,
      Israel’s crucial ally is inching closer to the conclusion Britain reached in Kenya
      after the Mau Mau uprising.


      For growing numbers of United States leaders, the risks and costs of its alliance
      with Israel are rising faster than the benefits. Many have been persuaded, including
      United States citizens, that providing Israel with funds and weapons rendered
      the United States “complicit in a genocide” and, therefore, isolated globally.
      The ceasefire imposed by Donald Trump has followed. Whether and how it functions
      and how Israel resists and evades the ongoing criticism will matter far less than
      the more basic trajectory underway now. History suggests that Benjamin Netanyahu
      or his successors will eventually be disconnected from the United States. Their
      lost alliance will hasten the end of Israel’s settler colonialism.'

    paragraph_summary: The article explores the historical parallels between European
      settler colonialism, particularly in Kenya, and the ongoing situation in Palestine-Israel,
      drawing on the author's personal experiences as a descendant of Holocaust victims.
      The author reflects on the impacts of European fascism and the atrocities of World
      War II, which led to the establishment of Israel and its settler colonial practices
      in Palestine. Despite initial successes, Israeli leaders have failed to learn
      from the lessons of past colonial failures, such as Britain's experience in Kenya,
      where rising resistance ultimately led to independence. The article argues that
      the current trajectory of conflict in Israel and Palestine, exacerbated by the
      decline of U.S. support, suggests that the continuation of settler colonialism
      in Israel may be unsustainable, as historical patterns indicate that resistance
      will grow stronger over time, potentially leading to a similar outcome as seen
      in Kenya.

  - title: 'United States in 2025: Social Problems Denied via Rhetorics of Refusal'
    url: https://www.counterpunch.org/2025/01/20/united-states-in-2025-social-problems-denied-via-rhetorics-of-refusal/
    text: 'Societies survive and grow when they successfully navigate their contradictions.
      Eventually, however, accumulating contradictions overwhelm existing means of navigating
      them. Then social problems arise that persist or worsen inside such societies
      because they are unsuccessfully navigated or go unattended. Sometimes, the dominant
      conscious reaction to such social problems is denial, a refusal to see them. Denial
      of internal social problems displaces navigating the contradictions that cause
      them. The resulting social decline, like the set of internal contradictions it
      reflects, is denied and ignored. Instead, narratives or rhetorics can arise that
      position such societies as victims of abuse by foreigners. The United States in
      2025 illustrates this process: its rhetorics of refusal aim to end its victimization.


      In today’s United States, one such rhetoric refuses to allow continued abuse by
      foreigners “threatening our national security.” This rhetoric blames bad U.S.
      political leadership for its failure to put America first and thereby make it
      great again. Another rhetoric demands that “we” refuse to allow “our democracy”
      to be destroyed by foreign enemies (and their domestic equivalents): people who
      are said to hate, not understand, or undervalue “our democracy.” Still another
      rhetoric of refusal sees foreigners “cheating” the United States in trade and
      migration processes. Most Americans embrace one or more of such rhetorics. Yet,
      as we propose to show here, such rhetorics are ever less effective.


      One reactionary rhetoric, Trump’s, gestures toward former greatness by literally
      renewing American imperialism. He threatens to retake the Panama Canal, change
      Canada into the 51st of the United States, conquer Greenland from Denmark, and
      possibly invade Mexico. All those foreigners are said to threaten national security
      or else “cheat” the United States. Trump’s typical bloviating aside, this is remarkable
      expansionism. Such repeated colonialist gestures feed broader notions of making
      America greater again.


      Colonialism repeatedly helped European capitalism navigate its internal contradictions
      (temporarily escaping the social problems it caused). Eventually, however, it
      could no longer do so. After World War II, anti-colonialism limited that escape.
      The subsequent European neo-colonialisms and the informal colonialism of the American
      empire had shorter life spans. China and the rest of the BRICS countries are now
      everywhere closing that escape. Hence the frustrated rage of Trump’s insistence
      on refusing that ending by deliberately reopening the idea of an escape hatch
      of colonial expansions. It resembles Netanyahu’s idea (if not yet his violence)
      in trying to reopen that hatch for Israel by driving Palestinians out of Gaza.
      United States support for Netanyahu likewise associates the U.S. with colonialist
      violence in a world overwhelmingly committed to end colonialism and its unwanted
      legacy.


      The United States boasts the world’s strongest military establishment. The dominant
      rhetoric in the United States casts everything it does as self-defense necessitated
      by foreign enemies. That justifies the government spending much more on defense
      than on the few internal social problems that rhetoric even recognizes. Yet the
      United States lost the wars in Vietnam, Afghanistan, Iraq, and now Ukraine, and
      these countries’ military establishments were far from the world’s strongest.
      It turns out that the proliferation of nuclear weapons and technical competition
      among nuclear powers have changed military balances around the world. The United
      States’ gross underestimates of Russia’s warfare capacities in 2022 illustrate
      the change very dramatically. They also illustrate that a rhetoric stressing a
      refusal to be victimized by foreign militaries undercut or displaced sober analyses
      of a militarily changed world. Now the world observes not only changed global
      military configurations but also the costly denials of them by U.S. leaders. Political
      and economic leaders everywhere else are now rethinking their strategies accordingly.
      Rhetorics of refusal to be victimized can become self-destructive.


      Another reason those leaders are redesigning their growth plans follows from the
      intertwined declines of the U.S. empire and the U.S. capitalist system. What U.S.
      leaders deny, many foreign leaders have incentives to see, evaluate, and take
      advantage of. The BRICS members (9) and partners (9), as of January 2025, account
      for nearly half the world’s population and 41 percent of the world’s GDP (in purchasing
      power parity terms). Four other nations have been invited and are likely to join
      in 2025: Vietnam, Turkey, Algeria, and Nigeria. Indonesia just joined as a full
      BRICS partner adding its roughly 280 million population. In contrast, the G7—the
      world’s second-largest economic bloc—accounts for about 10 percent of the world’s
      population and 30 percent of its GDP (also in purchasing power parity terms).
      Moreover, as data from the International Monetary Fund documents, recent years
      show a widening gap between the annual GDP growth rates of the G7-leading United
      States and the BRICS-leading China and India.


      Across the history of capitalism from its earlier times in England through the
      American empire’s peak early in the 21st century, most nations focused chiefly
      on the G7 in strategizing economic growth, debt, trade, investments, currency
      exchange rates, and balances of payments. Large- and medium-sized enterprises
      did likewise. Yet over the last 15–20 years, countries and enterprises have faced
      an altogether new, different global situation. China, India, and the rest of the
      BRICS countries offer an alternative possible focus. Everyone can now play the
      two blocs off against one another. Moreover, in this play, the BRICS now hold
      better, richer cards than the G7. Rhetorics of refusal spin these changes in the
      world economy as the evil intentions of foreign others—who likely hate democracy.
      The United States should righteously refuse and thereby frustrate those intentions,
      they argue. In contrast, far less attention is paid to how internal U.S. social
      problems both shape and are shaped by a changing global economy.


      The changing world economy and the relative decline of the G7 within it have turned
      U.S. capitalism away from neoliberal globalization toward economic nationalism.
      Tariffs, trade wars, and “America first” ideological pronouncements are concurrent
      forms of such turning inward. Another form is the call to bring parts of the outside
      of the United States inside: Trump’s unsubtle imperialistic threats directed at
      Canada, Mexico, Denmark, and Panama. Yet another form is the advisory many major
      U.S. colleges and universities are sending to enrolled students from other countries
      (over a million last year). It suggests they consider the likelihood of great
      visa difficulties in completing their degrees amid increasing U.S. government
      hostility toward foreigners. A reduced foreign student presence will undercut
      U.S. influence abroad for years to come (much as it fostered that influence in
      the past). U.S. higher education institutions, already facing serious financial
      difficulties, will find them deepening as paying foreign students choose other
      nations for their degrees. “America first” rhetoric risks the self-destruction
      of the United States’ global position.


      Politically, the U.S. strategy since World War II was to contain perceived foreign
      threats by a combination of “hard” and “soft” power. They would enable the United
      States to eliminate communism, socialism, and, after the Soviet implosion of 1989,
      terrorism, wherever possible, overtly or covertly. Hard power would be deployed
      by the U.S. military via hundreds of foreign military bases surrounding nations
      perceived to be threatening and via invasions if, when, and where deemed necessary.
      Hard power also took the form of implicit threats of nuclear warfare (made credible
      by the U.S. atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki) and by total U.S. arms
      race expenditures on nuclear and non-nuclear weapons that no other countries,
      alone or in groups, could match.


      “Soft power” would serve globally to project particular definitions of democracy,
      civil liberties, higher education, scientific achievement, and popular culture.
      These definitions were presented as best and most exemplified by what actually
      existed in the United States. In this way, the United States could be exalted
      as the global peak of civilized human achievement: a kind of partner discourse
      to other discourses that denied internal social problems. Enemies could then readily
      be demonized as inferior.


      U.S. soft power was and remains a kind of political advertising. The usual commercial
      advertiser promotes only everything positive (real or plausible) about his client’s
      product. Typically, everything negative (real or plausible) is associated by that
      same advertiser only with his client’s competitor’s product. One might call this
      “advertising communication.” In the 20th century’s Cold War, U.S. soft power entailed
      an application of advertising communication where the United States and its supporters,
      public and private, functioned as both client and advertiser. The United States
      advertised itself as “democracy” and the USSR as its negative opposite or “dictatorship.”
      Cold War advertising communication continues today in the slightly changed form
      of “democracy” versus “authoritarianism.” But like advertising, after too many
      repetitions its influence lessens.


      Unfortunately for the United States, economic problems now besetting its capitalist
      system—both those caused by accumulated internal contradictions and those caused
      by its declining position within the world economy—directly undercut its soft
      power projections. Brandishing tariffs and repeatedly threatening to increase
      them reflect the need for governmental protection for decreasingly competitive
      U.S.-based firms. U.S. rhetorics that instead blame foreigners for “cheating”
      sound increasingly hollow. Deporting millions of immigrants signals an economy
      no longer strong and growing enough to absorb them productively (what once “made
      America great” and showed that greatness to the world). U.S. rhetorics denouncing
      “foreign invasions” of immigrants encounter growing skepticism and even ridicule
      inside as well as outside the United States.


      The gross inequality of wealth and income in the United States and the global
      exposure of billionaires’ power over government (Musk over Trump, CEOs donating
      millions of dollars to Trump’s inauguration celebration) replace perceptions of
      the United States as exceptional in its vast middle class. The record levels of
      government, corporate, and household debt alongside abundant signs that such indebtedness
      is worsening do not help project the United States as an economic model. The year
      2024’s experience with a dominant U.S. strategy denying social problems while
      rhetorically stressing the dangers of evil foreign forces suggests it may be approaching
      exhaustion. The year 2025 may then provide conditions for a profound challenge
      to that strategy matching the challenges confronting the global position of U.S.
      capitalism.'
    one_sentence_summary: The article discusses how the United States, facing internal
      contradictions and social problems, employs denial and victimization narratives
      to justify its declining global influence and militaristic expansionism, while
      simultaneously underestimating the shifting dynamics of the world economy and
      the rise of BRICS nations, ultimately risking self-destruction through its inward-focused
      nationalism and rhetoric.
    paragraph_summary: The article discusses how societies, including the United States,
      struggle to manage internal contradictions, leading to social problems that are
      often ignored or denied. In the U.S., dominant narratives blame foreign threats
      for domestic issues, with rhetoric emphasizing victimization and a need to prioritize
      national security. This denial of internal contradictions, coupled with an increasingly
      ineffective response to global changes, has resulted in a shift towards economic
      nationalism and a decline in soft power. The U.S. faces challenges from rising
      powers like China and the BRICS nations, which now hold significant economic sway,
      while the U.S. grapples with its own economic inequalities and declining competitiveness.
      The article suggests that the current U.S. strategy of blaming foreign adversaries
      for its problems may be reaching a tipping point, necessitating a reevaluation
      of its approach to both domestic and international issues.

  - title: Political Economy Contradictions as We Lurch Into 2025
    url: https://www.counterpunch.org/2024/12/23/political-economy-contradictions-as-we-lurch-into-2025/
    text: 'The Republicans (GOP), traditionally the U.S.’s anti-tax party, now promise
      to use tariffs to wage trade wars, to massively deport immigrants, and to stop
      drug traffic. But tariffs are simply the name of one kind of tax (on imported
      goods and services). So the GOP becomes both anti-tax and pro-tax. Likewise, the
      traditional party of minimal government, today’s GOP now favors massive subsidies
      to industries that big government will select as well as economic sanctions and
      bans on enterprises and whole countries that big government will select. Beyond
      the right-wing ideology and financial self-serving, Trump reflects deeper contradictions
      in the GOP’s evolution.


      The GOP, traditionally the laissez-faire party of private enterprise, now favors
      increased government control of what private enterprises can and cannot offer
      in markets for reproductive healthcare, control medications and devices, and also
      for vaccines and drugs. The GOP, traditionally supporting “freedom,” now insists
      on blocking the free movement of people across borders and favors protectionist
      economic policy over a commitment to “free trade.” Some of Trump’s cabinet nominees
      voice traditional GOP views while others pronounce the new anti-traditional positions.
      Some nominees do both. Trump does not resolve the deep contradictions in the GOP’s
      message, thereby confusing both its messengers and its public audiences. In the
      moment, those contradictions give Trump some power. Amid the confusion, he decides.
      But soon conflicts among U.S. policies will expose the incoherence of Trump’s
      project and thereby sap his power.


      The Democratic party was, at least since the Great Depression of the 1930s, the
      “progressive” party of working people, unions, and oppressed minorities. Yet the
      rise of the “centrists” across recent decades shifted the Democrats rightward.
      As they became grateful recipients of corporate and billionaires’ donations, the
      Democrats increasingly supported the donor class by fielding “moderate” candidates,
      moderating their policies and programs, and publicly marginalizing the party’s
      remaining progressive wing. Privately, the Democrats’ centrist leaders pleaded
      and maneuvered to retain the traditional support of labor unions, oppressed minorities,
      and educated professionals. Moderation rendered the Democrats’ pursuit of gains
      for their traditional supporters ever less effective. So too did Democrats’ hold
      on those constituencies’ electoral commitments and loyalties dissipate. Success
      with donors contradicted deepening failures with voters, most starkly exposed
      in the 2024 election.


      Multiple, intense, and persistent contradictions within both parties suggest that
      some underlying, historic shifts may be underway. In my view, the first of those
      shifts is the peaking and subsequent decline in recent decades of the U.S. empire
      and its allies (especially the G7). This shift reflects and feeds the concurrent
      rise of the Global South, China, and the BRICS. A second shift is the accumulation
      of U.S. capitalism’s internal economic problems and difficulties. These are inadequately
      acknowledged, let alone solved. Chief among the problems are the long-term worsening
      of wealth and income inequalities and the persistent boom-bust or recession-inflation
      cycles for which no solution has been found.


      In short, both the GOP and the Democrats have denied both shifts. Indeed, denial
      has so far been the parties’ shared response to the linked declines of global
      empire and domestic capitalism. Denial rarely solves problems. It usually enables
      or provokes them to worsen until they explode.


      The key contradictions roiling political parties and their economic policies work
      parallel effects among professional economists. Unresolved, stale debates among
      economists react back upon policies, politicians, and public discourse to render
      them frustratingly powerless to fix what the public sees increasingly as a broken
      system. Starting with Adam Smith, David Ricardo, and the doctrine of laissez-faire
      and, especially since John Maynard Keynes, a huge portion of the profession has
      centered its work around an ongoing, seemingly endless debate. The question is
      whether our capitalist system is best served by minimal versus large, ongoing
      government interventions in its operation. Should we privilege pro-laissez-faire
      economics (the so-called neoclassical tradition) or governmental interventionist
      economics (the so-called Keynesian tradition) or some “synthesis” of both?


      This debate figured prominently in U.S. university economics classes 20, 40, and
      60 years ago much as it does in such classes today. The themes of that debate
      echoed prominently in the language of politics then and now. Occasionally, a few
      politicians recognized that the overdrawn oppositions, in theory, did not correspond
      all that well with actual practical politics. Nixon once said, “We are all Keynesian
      now.” Clinton boasted that he had “ended welfare as we know it.” Trump regularly
      excoriates Democrats as “radical left lunatics” and includes “fascists” among
      them. All three presidents were proved wrong, albeit quite self-assured, in making
      such confused and confusing statements.


      Yet the centrality of the private-versus-government dispute in both economic theory
      and policy continues. Its social usefulness lies more in what it excludes rather
      than in anything positive it includes. Putting that debate at the core of economics
      has helped prevent alternative cores from emerging that would challenge both neoclassical
      and Keynesian economics. One such alternative core would question whether top-down
      hierarchical organizations of production (the employer-employee model) better
      serve societies than horizontally egalitarian, democratic organizations (the worker
      coop model). Debates might then focus on which organization of production better
      preserves the natural environment, reduces income and wealth inequalities, overcomes
      cyclical economic instability, or advances the physical and mental health of people.


      The contradictions agitating discourses and practices these days may stem from
      the exhaustion of old economic and political traditions even as a new tradition
      is not yet clearly emerging. On the one hand, the U.S. and the UK now join Europe
      in turning clearly toward government-run protectionism instead of free trade.
      On the other, state-supervised China and India, among others, support free trade.
      The economic growth records of the USSR in the 20th century and of China in the
      21st century undermine preferences for private over state-regulated capitalisms.
      The old debate yields no new light on such central economic issues these days
      as the rise of the BRICS bloc in the world economy relative to the declines of
      an already smaller G7 bloc and the U.S. dollar in world trade.


      Of course, economists and politicians whose resumes mark them as leading proponents
      of neoclassical economics and privatization keep trying—like their Keynesian counterparts—to
      sustain the old debates that made them relevant. If they succeed, it will be because
      a still prevailing system prefers to rehash the old rather than welcome and explore
      what is emerging. In any case, however, relentless change will continue to work
      its ways on a passing U.S. empire and its capitalist system.

  - title: A Reformist Program on Immigration (Or What Harris Might Have Said)
    url: https://www.counterpunch.org/2024/11/26/a-reformist-program-on-immigration-or-what-harris-might-have-said/
    text: 'The immigration issue has split and/or weakened both center and left parties
      and movements across many nations in recent years. Serious economic and social
      problems afflicting national working classes have been “managed”—at least temporarily—by
      scapegoating immigrants as if they were responsible for those problems. Leaders
      on the left fear that many among their supporters are vulnerable to that scapegoating.
      In contrast, leaders on the right often see that scapegoating as a means to achieve
      electoral gains. Trump reflected and strengthened the view that such scapegoating
      can get votes. The widespread perception that Kamala Harris too would be “tough
      on immigrants” showed that she offered no real alternative program on immigration.
      Thus, the classically reactionary posing of the issue as “protecting the nation
      against an immigrant ‘invasion’” widely prevailed.


      Appeals to morality, multiculturalism, and compassion for the plight of most immigrants
      failed to dissuade many on the left from disengaging and moving politically rightward.
      The center or moderate left needs but lacks clear, strong support for immigrants
      that does not alienate portions of their traditional electoral base. “Me-too”
      opposition to immigration, even if less harsh and hostile than that of the professional
      demagogues, will fail, as Kamala Harris’s campaign discovered. Moreover, classic
      left reformism suggests a radically different program on immigration. It is derived
      from the reformist program (the “Green New Deal”) to address climate change when
      it faced a parallel problem with job-holders in polluting industries. A parallel
      reformist program to deal with immigration might be called an “Inclusive New Deal.”


      In contrast, conservative, right-wing, and fascistic political forces have used
      extreme opposition to immigration to grow their ranks. Those forces boldly accuse
      immigrants of bringing crime, disease, downward pressure on wages, competition
      for jobs, and burdensome, costly demands on schools, hospitals, and other public
      services. Even in the United States, a country mostly composed of successive immigrant
      waves (who obliterated and replaced the indigenous people), many of those immigrants’
      descendants now hold anti-immigrant views. Despite massive evidence to the contrary,
      they rationalize those views by insisting that, unlike former immigrants, today’s
      differ in being “unwilling to work.”


      Rightists advance their radical “solutions” such as sharply tightening immigration
      rules, refusing all further immigration, and deporting millions. Even where moral,
      ethical, and religious traditions call us to welcome immigrants, right-wingers
      have found that anti-immigration politics can work well. They attack center-leftists
      for seeking future votes by being pro-immigration or only weakly anti-immigration.
      In the United States, they attack the Democratic Party for not putting their American-born
      constituents first. Patriotism, as defined by such rightists, now entails a strict
      anti-immigrant position that displaces traditional religions’ endorsement of the
      opposite.


      Immigrants forced to arrive as slaves, Black people in the United States, for
      example, fared differently: their integration was mostly slower and much more
      partial. Brown immigrants who arrived as other than slaves also suffered slower
      and partial integration. Anti-Black-and-Brown racism added further discrimination
      and life difficulties to the experience of those immigrants. Institutionalized
      racism denied opportunities for such immigrant communities to develop their members’
      levels of education, job skills, businesses, personal wealth, and social confidence.
      All immigrants suffer delays in their access to those qualities and capabilities,
      but the addition of racism worsens and lengthens those delays, including in U.S.
      society today. The difficulties usually endured by immigrants slow and skew the
      development of the economy they have entered. The occasional explosions of immigrants’
      resentments and bitterness at their treatment—and the usually very violent subsequent
      repressions—then add further damage to their host economies.


      Repeated efforts by those opposed to immigration have rarely succeeded in stopping
      it. The broad range of social forces—including the persistent effects of colonial
      and neo-colonial subjugation, uneven capitalist development, and climate change—that
      propel people to emigrate usually outweigh their concerns for their own economic,
      personal safety, and family interests. For employers, immigration can cheapen
      labor costs by expanding the supply of labor power (especially when the opposite
      is threatened by falling birthrates or when capital accumulation risks bidding
      up wages). Undocumented immigrants offer employers notoriously outrageous opportunities
      for super-exploitation. Hence, they often support it.


      An important social cost of immigration is the opportunity it has regularly presented
      to demagogic politicians. They have repeatedly scapegoated immigrants to deflect
      genuine mass discontent where it might otherwise threaten the domestic employer
      class. Is there unemployment? The demagogue suggests that jobs are being preferentially
      reserved for immigrants. Are public services inadequate? The demagogue suggests
      that immigrants are placing excessive demands on them and corrupt officials are
      directing them to immigrants to secure cheap labor or votes. Demagogues often
      insist—again despite evidence to the contrary—that immigrants commit more crimes
      and bring and spread more disease than the native-born.


      The campaigns of Donald Trump and many Republicans scapegoated immigrants. Many
      Democrats’ campaigns likewise featured the scapegoating of immigrants. In contrast,
      the real, basic economic problems of the United States were not seriously addressed
      in the latest presidential election campaigns. One of those is the immense gap
      between haves and have-nots that has widened over the last 40 years. Another is
      the economic instability that has the economy oscillating between inflation and
      recessions. Still another is the obvious decline of the American empire (the relatively
      declining roles of U.S. exports, imports, investments, and the dollar) within
      the global economy. These issues were marginalized or, more often, ignored. Instead,
      candidates relentlessly scapegoated 12 million undocumented immigrants (among
      the poorest of the poor) as if they were the cause of and thus to blame for the
      deep problems of U.S. capitalism, an economy of 330 million people. Likewise,
      they excoriated China for the economic competition its economic growth has brought
      to the United States. Doing that conveniently deflects blame from the corporate
      employers who made the decision to move production from the United States to China.
      As usual, all social blame or criticism must be kept from touching the U.S. capitalist
      system that accounts for those profit-driven decisions.


      Deep, costly, and lasting consequences have followed the demagoguery and divisions
      in societies that split over immigration. Much energy, time, and money is diverted
      from dealing with the nation’s real economic problems to obsessive “coping with”
      immigration (homeland security budgets, border patrol budgets, and wall construction
      and maintenance). Still more is devoted to housing, policing, feeding, and otherwise
      “processing” undocumented immigrants. If high-priority policy instead created
      good jobs with good incomes for immigrants, huge portions of these social costs
      would be unnecessary. Moreover, worthwhile alternatives to failed existing immigration
      policies are available if sufficient political power places them on the social
      and political agendas of societies confronting immigration. A remarkable flaw
      of today’s global capitalism lies in its provocation of massive migration of people
      alongside its massive, costly failure to plan or manage that migration.


      One such alternative policy could solve together the recurring problems of unemployment,
      inadequate housing and social services, and immigration. In the U.S. case, another
      Marshall Plan or “Inclusive” New Deal, green or otherwise, is needed. It could
      create jobs performing public services (paid at or above the current median for
      such jobs) that would be provided, as a right, to every unemployed citizen as
      priority #1. As priority #2, equivalent jobs would be provided, as a right, to
      all immigrants. As priority #3, the jobs thus created would include expanding
      the housing and all other social services needed to adequately accommodate the
      entire population, native plus immigrant. The tragic social divisiveness of immigrant-vs-native
      competition for jobs might thereby be sharply reduced.


      Such an Inclusive New Deal could be funded by (1) billions of dollars no longer
      needed for unemployment insurance, (2) increased income and other taxes paid by
      newly employed native and immigrant workers, (3) increased taxes paid by businesses
      profiting from increased spending by those workers, and (4) an annual wealth tax
      of 2 percent on all personal wealth above $20 million. Immigration could be reduced
      for the first five years of this Inclusive New Deal to get it fully established
      and running.


      A major side benefit of this Inclusive New Deal would be the huge boost in receipts
      for Social Security. Another such benefit would be the reduced demands placed
      on social services by the better physical and mental health of all newly employed
      workers. Finally, as a social dividend from such an Inclusive New Deal, the official
      work week in the United States for all workers could be reduced from 40 to 36
      hours (with no pay reduction).


      Imagine the enormous social benefits that would accrue to the entire U.S. population,
      native and immigrant, from this different reformist approach to the immigration
      issue. In the United States and beyond, such an approach would reduce the social
      divisions over jobs, incomes, housing, homelessness, social services, and immigration.
      A strong, growing economy attracts immigrants, integrates them productively, and
      thereby impresses the world. A weak, declining economy not only fails to employ
      all its people productively but by deporting immigrants advertises its failure
      to the world. A radical program would embrace the freedom to migrate as universal
      and therefore reorient the global location of investment to serve that freedom
      both domestically and internationally.

    url: https://www.counterpunch.org/2024/10/21/u-s-and-china-why-not-a-deal/
    text: 'An old theme within social theory holds that societies with very unequal
      distributions of wealth can sustain their social cohesion so long as total wealth
      is growing. Such total growth enables all who get a distributed share of that
      wealth—even those with the smallest shares—to experience at least some increase.
      The rich with the biggest shares can grab most of the growth so long as some is
      provided to those with small shares. The pie analogy works well: so long as the
      pie is growing all distributed shares of it can also grow. Some will grow more,
      others less, but all can grow. If all do grow, social stability is facilitated
      (assuming the society’s population accepts unequal shares). Modern capitalism’s
      prioritization of economic growth as urgently necessary reflects such social theory
      (much as economic growth has reinforced it).


      Of course, if instead, a society’s population prioritizes movement toward less
      unequal shares, economic growth becomes relatively less important. If a society’s
      population seriously accommodates climate change, economic growth can become still
      less important. Were social movements endorsing such priorities to grow and ally,
      they could well alter societies’ attitudes toward and commitments to economic
      growth.


      U.S. capitalism from 1820 to 1980 favored and fostered rising total wealth. The
      share going to wages grew while the share going to capital grew more. Notwithstanding
      many bitter capital/labor struggles, the United States as a whole exhibited considerable
      social cohesion. This was because, in part, a growing pie allowed nearly all to
      experience some growth in their real income. “Nearly all” could be rewritten as
      “whites.”


      In contrast, the last 40 years, 1980–2020, represent an inflection point inside
      the United States. The growth of total wealth slowed while corporations and the
      rich took greater relative shares. Therefore, middle-income people and the poor
      found their wealth either not growing much or not at all.


      The reasons for slowing U.S. wealth growth include chiefly the profit-driven relocations
      of capitalism’s dynamic centers. Industrial production moved from Western Europe,
      North America, and Japan to China, India, Brazil, and others. Financialization
      prevailed in the capitalism left behind. China and its BRICS allies increasingly
      match or exceed the United States and its G7 allies in levels of production, technical
      innovation, and foreign trade. The U.S. response to their competition—growing
      protectionism expressed by imposing tariffs, trade wars, and sanctions—mobilizes
      increasing retaliation that worsens the U.S. situation. This process is continuing
      with no end now visible. The U.S. dollar’s role in the world economy declines.
      Geopolitically, the United States sees former allies such as Brazil, India, and
      Egypt shift loyalties toward China or else toward a more neutral position relative
      to the United States and China.


      The combination of slowing total wealth growth with a larger share going to corporations
      and those they enrich undercuts the United States’ internal social cohesion. Political
      and cultural divisions inside the United States, exposed sharply in the Trump-Harris
      contest, have become social hostilities that further undermine the global position
      of the United States. Empires’ declines and their internal social divisions often
      accelerate each other. For example, consider the scapegoating of immigrants in
      the United States that now includes charging Haitians with eating pets and ignoring
      data showing the greater criminality of citizens relative to immigrants. White
      supremacy resurged to become more public and fuel increasingly divisive regionalism
      and racism. Struggles over the issues of patriarchy, sexuality, and gender are
      sharper than they have perhaps ever been. Long deferred protests over social conditions
      proliferate when empires decline, growth slows, and social cohesion unravels.


      Via a parallel logic, matters in China differ very significantly. For the last
      several decades, China’s GDP growth has been two to three times faster than that
      of the United States. The growth of average real wages in China has been faster
      than that in the United States by much larger multiples. These differences are
      stark and have been sustained for a generation. The Chinese leadership—its Communist
      Party and government—was thereby enabled to distribute the fruits of its rapid
      economic growth—its rising wealth—to support internal social cohesion. It did
      so by its policies of raising real wages and moving hundreds of millions from
      rural and agricultural to urban and industrial positions. For those Chinese people,
      this was a historic transition from poverty to middle-income status.


      China’s growth plus that of its BRICS allies produced a major competitor for the
      United States and the G7 by 2010. Both blocs now scour the globe looking for secure,
      cheap sources of food, raw materials, and energy. Both likewise seek access to
      markets, secure transport routes and supply chains, and friendly governments.
      Both subsidize cutting-edge technological advances such that the United States
      and China now virtually monopolize their achievement (relative to what Europe
      or Japan once did).


      U.S. policy-makers portray China’s global efforts as aggressive, threatening the
      U.S. empire and thereby potentially U.S. capitalism itself. Chinese policymakers
      see U.S. efforts (protectionist tariffs and trade restrictions, South China Sea
      maneuvers, foreign military bases and wars) as aimed to slow or stop China’s economic
      development. For them, the United States is blocking China’s growth opportunities
      and dynamism, possibly foreshadowing a resumption of years of China’s humiliation
      that it finds totally unacceptable. National security anxieties haunt both sides’
      rhetoric. Predictions spread of imminent military conflicts and even another world
      war.


      At a time when the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East lead many to call for immediate
      ceasefires and negotiated settlements, might history suggest something similar
      for the United States and China now? Britain tried twice (1776 and 1812) to use
      war to slow or stop the independence and growth of its North American colony.
      After failing twice, Britain changed its policies. Negotiations enabled the new
      United States and Britain increasingly to trade with and economically develop
      one another. Britain focused on retaining, profiting from, and building up the
      rest of its empire. The United States declared that its imperial focus would henceforth
      be South America (the “Monroe Doctrine”). This remained the deal until World War
      II ended Britain’s empire and allowed the United States to extend its own.


      Why not a comparable deal between the United States and China, bringing in the
      G7, BRICS, and the Global South? With genuine global participation, might such
      a deal finally end empires? The very real dangers—ecological as well as geopolitical—that
      the world now faces encourage finding some kind of negotiated agreement on a multipolar
      world. After World War I, such goals inspired the League of Nations. After World
      War II, they inspired the United Nations. The realism of those goals was challenged
      then. It cannot suffer that indignity again now. Might we manage to achieve those
      goals now without World War III?

    paragraph_summary: The article explores the relationship between wealth distribution,
      social cohesion, and economic growth, particularly in the context of the United
      States and China. It argues that historically, societies with growing wealth can
      maintain social stability despite inequality, as even the less affluent benefit
      from overall growth. However, since 1980, the U.S. has experienced slowing wealth
      growth, with a larger share going to corporations and the wealthy, leading to
      increased social divisions and political strife. In contrast, China's rapid economic
      growth has allowed it to distribute wealth more equitably, fostering internal
      cohesion. The article suggests that the U.S. and China are now in a competitive
      geopolitical landscape, with both nations viewing each other's actions as threats.
      It proposes that, similar to historical precedents, a negotiated agreement between
      the U.S. and China could help avert conflict and promote a multipolar world, addressing
      the pressing global challenges of today.

    url: https://www.counterpunch.org/2024/09/09/the-decline-of-the-u-s-empire-where-is-it-taking-us-all/
    text: 'The evidence suggests that empires often react to periods of their own decline
      by over-extending their coping mechanisms. Military actions, infrastructure problems,
      and social welfare demands may then combine or clash, accumulating costs and backlash
      effects that the declining empire cannot manage. Policies aimed to strengthen
      empire—and that once did—now undermine it. Contemporary social changes inside
      and outside the empire can reinforce, slow, or reverse the decline. However, when
      decline leads leaders to deny its existence, it can become self-accelerating.
      In empires’ early years, leaders and the led may repress those among them who
      stress or merely even mention decline. Social problems may likewise be denied,
      minimized, or, if admitted, blamed on convenient scapegoats—immigrants, foreign
      powers, or ethnic minorities—rather than linked to imperial decline.


      The U.S. empire, audaciously proclaimed by the Monroe Doctrine soon after two
      independence wars won against Britain, grew across the 19th and 20th centuries,
      and peaked during the decades between 1945 and 2010. The rise of the U.S. empire
      overlapped with the decline of the British empire. The Soviet Union represented
      limited political and military challenges, but never any serious economic competition
      or threat. The Cold War was a lopsided contest whose outcome was programmed in
      from its beginning. All of the U.S. empire’s potential economic competitors or
      threats were devastated by World War II. The following years found Europe losing
      its colonies. The unique global position of the United States then, with its disproportional
      position in world trade and investment, was anomalous and likely unsustainable.
      An attitude of denial at the time that decline was all but certain morphed only
      too readily into the attitude of denial now that the decline is well underway.


      The United States could not prevail militarily over all of Korea in its 1950–53
      war there. The United States lost its subsequent wars in Vietnam, Afghanistan,
      and Iraq. The NATO alliance was insufficient to alter any of those outcomes. U.S.
      military and financial support for Ukraine and the massive United States and NATO
      sanctions war against Russia are failures to date and are likely to remain so.
      U.S. sanctions programs against Cuba, Iran, and China have failed too. Meanwhile,
      the BRICS alliance counteracts U.S. policies to protect its empire, including
      its sanctions warfare, with increasing effectiveness.


      In the realms of trade, investment, and finance, we can measure the decline of
      the U.S. empire differently. One index is the decline of the U.S. dollar as a
      central bank reserve holding. Another is its decline as a means of trade, loans,
      and investment. Finally, consider the U.S. dollar’s decline alongside that of
      dollar-denominated assets as internationally desired means of holding wealth.
      Across the Global South, countries, industries, or firms seeking trade, loans,
      or investments used to go to London, Washington, or Paris for decades; they now
      have other options. They can go instead to Beijing, New Delhi, or Moscow, where
      they often secure more attractive terms.


      Empire confers special advantages that translate into extraordinary profits for
      firms located in the country that dominates the empire. The 19th century was remarkable
      for its endless confrontations and struggles among empires competing for territory
      to dominate and thus for their industries’ higher profits. Declines of any one
      empire could enhance opportunities for competing empires. If the latter grabbed
      those opportunities, the former’s decline could worsen. One set of competing empires
      delivered two world wars in the last century. Another set seems increasingly driven
      to deliver worse, possibly nuclear world wars in this century.


      Before World War I, theories circulated that the evolution of multinational corporations
      out of merely national mega-corporations would end or reduce the risks of war.
      Owners and directors of increasingly global corporations would work against war
      among countries as a logical extension of their profit-maximizing strategies.
      The century’s two world wars undermined those theories’ appearance of truth. So
      too did the fact that multinational mega-corporations increasingly purchased governments
      and subordinated state policies to those corporations’ competing growth strategies.
      Capitalists’ competition governed state policies at least as much as the reverse.
      Out of their interaction emerged the wars of the 21st century in Afghanistan,
      Iraq, Syria, Ukraine, and Gaza. Likewise from their interaction, rising U.S.-China
      tensions emerged around Taiwan and the South China Sea.


      China presents a unique analytical problem. The private capitalist half of its
      hybrid economic system exhibits growth imperatives parallel to those agitating
      economies where 90–100 percent of enterprises are private capitalist in organization.
      The state-owned-and-operated enterprises comprising the other half of China’s
      economy exhibit different drives and motivations. Profit is less their bottom
      line than it is for private capitalist enterprises. Similarly, the Communist Party’s
      rule over the state—including the state’s regulation of the entire Chinese economy—introduces
      other objectives besides profit, ones that also govern enterprise decisions. Since
      China and its major economic allies (BRICS) comprise the entity now competing
      with the declining U.S. empire and its major economic allies (G7), China’s uniqueness
      may yield an outcome different from past clashes of empires.


      In the past, one empire often supplanted another. That may be our future with
      this century becoming “China’s” as previous empires were American, British, and
      so on. However, China’s history includes earlier empires that rose and fell: another
      unique quality. Might China’s past and its present hybrid economy influence China
      away from becoming another empire and rather toward a genuinely multipolar global
      organization instead? Might the dreams and hopes behind the League of Nations
      and the United Nations achieve reality if and when China makes that happen? Or
      will China become the next global hegemon against heightened resistance from the
      United States, bringing the risk of nuclear war closer?


      A rough historical parallel may shed some additional light from a different angle
      on where today’s class of empires may lead. The movement toward independence of
      its North American colony irritated Britain sufficiently for it to attempt two
      wars (1775–83 and 1812–15) to stop that movement. Both wars failed. Britain learned
      the valuable lesson that peaceful co-existence with some co-respective planning
      and accommodation would enable both economies to function and grow, including
      in trade and investment both ways across their borders. That peaceful co-existence
      extended to allowing the imperial reach of the one to give way to that of the
      other.


      Why not suggest a similar trajectory for U.S.-China relations over the next generation?
      Except for ideologues detached from reality, the world would prefer it over the
      nuclear alternative. Dealing with the two massive, unwanted consequences of capitalism—climate
      change and unequal distributions of wealth and income—offers projects for a U.S.-China
      partnership that the world will applaud. Capitalism changed dramatically in both
      Britain and the United States after 1815. It will likely do so again after 2025.
      The opportunities are attractively open-ended.

  - title: Why Poverty Reduction Under Capitalism is a Myth
    url: https://www.counterpunch.org/2024/08/27/why-poverty-reduction-under-capitalism-is-a-myth/
    text: 'From its beginnings, the capitalist economic system produced both critics
      and celebrants, those who felt victimized and those who felt blessed. Where victims
      and critics developed analyses, demands, and proposals for change, beneficiaries,
      and celebrants developed alternative discourses defending the system.


      Certain kinds of arguments proved widely effective against capitalism’s critics
      and in obtaining mass support. These became capitalism’s basic supportive myths.
      One such myth is that capitalism created prosperity and reduced poverty.


      Capitalists and their biggest fans have long argued that the system is an engine
      of wealth creation. Capitalism’s early boosters, such as Adam Smith and David
      Ricardo, and likewise capitalism’s early critics such as Karl Marx, recognized
      that fact. Capitalism is a system built to grow.


      Because of market competition among capitalist employers, “growing the business”
      is necessary, most of the time, for it to survive. Capitalism is a system driven
      to grow wealth, but wealth creation is not unique to capitalism. The idea that
      only capitalism creates wealth or that it does so more than other systems is a
      myth.


      What else causes wealth production? There are a whole host of other contributors
      to wealth. It’s never only the economic system, whether capitalist or feudal or
      slave or socialist. Wealth creation depends on all kinds of circumstances in history
      (such as raw materials, weather, or inventions) that determine if and how fast
      wealth is created. All of those factors play roles alongside that of the particular
      economic system in place.


      When the USSR imploded in 1989, some claimed that capitalism had “defeated” its
      only real competitor—socialism—proving that capitalism was the greatest possible
      creator of wealth. The “end of history” had been reached, it was said, at least
      in relation to economic systems. Once and for all, nothing better than capitalism
      could be imagined, let alone achieved.


      The myth here is a common mistake and grossly overused. While wealth was created
      in significant quantities over the last few centuries as capitalism spread globally,
      that does not prove it was capitalism that caused the growth in wealth. Maybe
      wealth grew despite capitalism. Maybe it would have grown faster with some other
      system. Evidence for that possibility includes two important facts. First, the
      fastest economic growth (as measured by GDP) in the 20th century was that achieved
      by the USSR. And second, the fastest growth in wealth in the 21st century so far
      is that of the People’s Republic of China. Both of those societies rejected capitalism
      and proudly defined themselves as socialist.


      Another version of this myth, especially popular in recent years, claims capitalism
      deserves credit for bringing many millions out of poverty over the last 200 to
      300 years. In this story, capitalism’s wealth creation brought everyone a higher
      standard of living with better food, wages, job conditions, medicine and health
      care, education, and scientific advancements. Capitalism supposedly gave huge
      gifts to the poorest among us and deserves our applause for such magnificent social
      contributions.


      The problem with this myth is like that with the wealth-creation myth discussed
      above. Just because millions escaped poverty during capitalism’s global spread
      does not prove that capitalism is the reason for this change. Alternative systems
      could have enabled an escape from poverty during the same period of time, or for
      more people more quickly, because they organized production and distribution differently.


      Capitalism’s profit focus has often held back the distribution of products to
      drive up their prices and, therefore, profits. Patents and trademarks of profit-seeking
      businesses effectively slow the distribution of all sorts of products. We cannot
      know whether capitalism’s incentive effects outweigh its slowing effects. Claims
      that, overall, capitalism promotes rather than slows progress are pure ideological
      assertions. Different economic systems—capitalism included—promote and delay development
      in different ways at different speeds in their different parts.


      Capitalists and their supporters have almost always opposed measures designed
      to lessen or eliminate poverty. They blocked minimum wage laws often for many
      years, and when such laws were passed, they blocked raising the minimums (as they
      have done in the United States since 2009). Capitalists similarly opposed laws
      outlawing or limiting child labor, reducing the length of the working day, providing
      unemployment compensation, establishing government pension systems such as Social
      Security, providing a national health insurance system, challenging gender and
      racial discrimination against women and people of color, or providing a universal
      basic income. Capitalists have led opposition to progressive tax systems, occupational
      safety and health systems, and free universal education from preschool through
      university. Capitalists have opposed unions for the last 150 years and likewise
      restricted collective bargaining for large classes of workers. They have opposed
      socialist, communist, and anarchist organizations aimed at organizing the poor
      to demand relief from poverty.


      The truth is this: to the extent that poverty has been reduced, it has happened
      despite the opposition of capitalists. To credit capitalists and capitalism for
      the reduction in global poverty is to invert the truth. When capitalists try to
      take credit for the poverty reduction that was achieved against their efforts,
      they count on their audiences not knowing the history of fighting poverty in capitalism.


      Recent claims that capitalism overcame poverty are often based on misinterpretations
      of certain data. For example, the United Nations defines extreme poverty as an
      income of under $1.97 per day. The number of poor people living on under $1.97
      per day has decreased markedly in the last century. But one country, China—the
      world’s largest by population—has experienced one of the greatest escapes from
      poverty in the world in the last century, and therefore, has an outsized influence
      on all totals. Given China’s huge influence on poverty measures, one could claim
      that reduced global poverty in recent decades results from an economic system
      that insists it is not capitalist but rather socialist.


      Economic systems are eventually evaluated according to how well or not they serve
      the society in which they exist. How each system organizes the production and
      distribution of goods and services determines how well it meets its population’s
      basic needs for health, safety, sufficient food, clothing, shelter, transport,
      education, and leisure to lead a decent, productive work-life balance. How well
      is modern capitalism performing in that sense?


      Modern capitalism has now accumulated around 100 individuals in the world who
      together own more wealth than the bottom half of this planet’s population (over
      3.5 billion people). Those hundred richest people’s financial decisions have as
      much influence over how the world’s resources are used as the financial decisions
      of 3.5 billion, the poorest half of this planet’s population. That is why the
      poor die early in a world of modern medicine, suffer from diseases that we know
      how to cure, starve when we produce more than enough food, lack education when
      we have plenty of teachers, and experience so much more tragedy. Is this what
      reducing poverty looks like?


      Crediting capitalism for poverty reduction is another myth. Poverty was reduced
      by the poor’s struggle against a poverty reproduced systemically by capitalism
      and capitalists. Moreover, the poor’s battles were often aided by militant working-class
      organizations, including pointedly anti-capitalist organizations.

      at Work, 2024) was produced by Economy for All, a project of the Independent Media

    one_sentence_summary: The article argues that the belief that capitalism is the
      primary driver of wealth creation and poverty reduction is a myth, as historical
      evidence suggests that wealth growth and poverty alleviation have occurred despite
      capitalism and often due to the struggles of the poor and alternative economic
      systems.
    paragraph_summary: The article critiques the common myths surrounding capitalism,
      particularly the beliefs that it is the sole creator of wealth and the primary
      driver of poverty reduction. While proponents of capitalism argue that it fosters
      prosperity and alleviates poverty, the author contends that these claims are misleading
      and ignore the contributions of various historical and social factors, as well
      as the successes of non-capitalist systems like socialism, particularly in countries
      like China. The article emphasizes that poverty reduction has often occurred despite
      capitalist opposition, with capitalists historically resisting measures aimed
      at alleviating poverty. It highlights the stark wealth inequality under modern
      capitalism, where a small number of individuals possess more wealth than half
      the global population, raising questions about capitalism's effectiveness in meeting
      societal needs. Ultimately, the author argues that crediting capitalism for poverty
      reduction overlooks the struggles of the poor and the role of anti-capitalist
      movements in achieving social progress.

  - title: Capitalism, Mass Anger and the 2024 Elections
    url: https://www.counterpunch.org/2024/08/14/capitalism-mass-anger-and-the-2024-elections/
    text: 'In the wake of his huge defeat on June 30, 2024, when 80 percent of voters
      rejected French “centrist” President Emmanuel Macron, he said he understood the
      French people’s anger. In the UK, Conservative loser Rishi Sunak said the same
      about the British people’s anger, as Labor leader Starmer now says as the anger
      explodes. Of course, such phrases from such politicians usually mean little or
      nothing and accomplish less. Such leaders and their parties just keep calculating
      how best to regain power when they lose it. In that, they are like the U.S. Democrats
      after Biden’s performance in his debate with Trump and like the U.S. Republicans
      after Trump’s loss in 2020. In both parties, a small group of top leaders and
      top donors made all the key decisions and then organized the political theater
      to ratify those decisions. Even surprises like Harris replacing Biden are temporary
      departures from resuming politics as usual.


      However, unlike Trump, the others missed opportunities to identify with an already
      organized mass base of angry people. Trump stumbled into that identification by
      saying loudly and crudely what traditional politicians treated as publicly unspeakable
      about immigrants, women, NATO, and traditional political taboos. That set the
      tone for Trump then doubling down by insisting he had won the 2020 election but
      had been cheated out of it. The mass anger of populations feeling victimized in
      their workaday lives found a spokesperson loudly claiming parallel victimizations.
      Trump and base grasped that together they might victimize their victimizers.


      Whether or not they can politically exploit voters’ anger, no mainstream leader
      in the collective West, including Trump, seems actually to “understand” it. They
      mostly see only as far as what they can plausibly blame on their opponents in
      the next election. Biden blamed Trump for a “bad” economy in 2020, while Trump
      reversed the same blame over the last year and will shortly adjust to blaming
      Harris. Presidential opponents blame the other for the “immigration crisis,” for
      inadequately protecting U.S. industry from Chinese competition, government budget
      deficits, and job exports.


      No mainstream leader “understands” (or dares to hint or suggest) that mass anger
      these days might be something more and different from any collection of specific
      complaints and demands (about guns, abortion, taxes, and wars). Even the demagogues
      who like to speak about “culture wars” dare not ask why such “wars” are hot now.
      Angry “Make America Great Again” (MAGA) folks are notably vague and poorly informed
      as their critics enjoy exposing. Rarely do those critics offer persuasive alternative
      explanations for MAGA anger (explanations that are neither vague nor poorly informed).


      In particular, we ask, might the anger that the MAGA movement enrolls express
      a genuine mass suffering that has not yet understood its cause? Might that cause
      be nothing less than the decline of Western capitalism and all it represents?
      If ideological taboos and blinders preclude admitting it, might that decline’s
      results—anxiety, despair, and anger—focus instead on suitable scapegoats? Are
      Trump and Biden, Macron and Sunak, and so many others competitively choosing scapegoats
      to mobilize an anger they misunderstand and dare not explore?


      After all, Western capitalism is no longer the world’s colonial master. The American
      empire that succeeded the European empires has now followed them into decline.
      The next empire will be Chinese or else the era of empires will give way to genuine
      global multipolarity. Western capitalism is likewise no longer the world’s dynamic
      growth center as that has moved eastward. Western capitalism is clearly losing
      its former position as the self-confident, unified, ultimate power behind the
      World Bank, United Nations, International Monetary Fund, and the U.S. dollar as
      world currency.


      In terms of global economic footprints as measured by national GDPs, the United
      States and its major allies (G7) comprise a total, aggregated GDP now that is
      already significantly less than the comparable aggregated GDPs of China and its
      major allies (BRICS). The footprints of the two global economic power blocs were
      roughly equal in 2020. The difference between the two footprints has been widening
      ever since and continues to do so. China and its BRICS allies are increasingly
      the world economy’s richest bloc. Nothing prepared the populations of Western
      capitalism for this changed reality or its effects. Especially the sections of
      those populations already forced to absorb the costly burdens of Western capitalism’s
      decline feel betrayed, abandoned, and angry. Elections are merely one way for
      some of them to express those feelings.


      Western capitalism’s rich, powerful, and small minority practices a combination
      of denial and adjustment to its decline. Prevailing politicians, mainstream media,
      and academics continue to orate, write, and act as if the collective West were
      still globally dominant. For them and their ways of thinking, their global dominance
      in the second half of the last century never ended. The wars in Ukraine and Gaza
      testify to that denial and exemplify the costly strategic mistakes it produces.


      When not denying the new reality, significant portions of Western capitalism’s
      corporate rich and powerful are adjusting their preferred economic policies away
      from neoliberalism toward economic nationalism. The chief rationale for that adjustment
      is that it serves “national security” because it may at least slow “China’s aggressiveness.”
      Domestically, the rich and powerful in each country use their positions and resources
      to shift the costs of Western capitalism’s decline onto the mass of their middle-income
      and poorer fellow citizens. They worsen income and wealth inequalities, cut governmental
      social services, and harden police behaviors and prison conditions.


      Denial facilitates the continued decline of Western capitalism. Too little is
      done too late against problems not yet admitted. Deteriorating social conditions
      flowing from that decline, especially for the middle income and the poor, provide
      opportunities for the usual right-wing demagogues. They proceed to blame the decline
      on immigrants, foreigners, excessive state power, the Democrats, China, secularism,
      abortion, and culture war enemies, hoping thereby to assemble a winning electoral
      constituency. Sadly, left-wing commentary focuses on refuting the right’s claims
      about its chosen scapegoats. While its refutations are often well-documented and
      effective in media combat against right-wing Republicans, the left too rarely
      invokes explicit, sustained arguments about mass anger’s links to declining capitalism.
      The left fails sufficiently to stress that government regulators, however well-intentioned,
      have been captured by and subordinated to specifically private capitalist profiteers.


      The mass of people therefore became deeply skeptical about relying on the government
      to correct or offset the failings of private capitalism. People grasp, often just
      intuitively, that today’s problem is the merger of capitalists and government.
      Left and right increasingly feel betrayed by all the promises of center-left and
      center-right politicians. More or less government intervention has changed too
      little in the trajectory of modern capitalism. To growing numbers, politicians
      of the center-left and center-right seem equally docile servants of the capitalist-government
      merger that constitutes modern capitalism with all its failures and flaws. Thus
      today’s right succeeds if, when, and where it can portray itself as not centrist,
      its candidates explicitly anti-centrist. The left is weaker because too many of
      its programs seem still linked to the idea that government interventions will
      correct or offset capitalism’s shortcomings.


      In short, mass anger is disconnected from declining capitalism in part because
      left, right and center deny, avoid, or neglect their link. Mass anger does not
      translate into or yet move to explicit anti-capitalist politics in part because
      too few organized political movements lead in that way.


      Thus, Rachel Reeves, the Chancellor of the Exchequer in Britain’s new Labour Party
      government—its top financial officer—blithely announces, “There is not a lot of
      money there.” She prepares the public—and preemptively excuses the new government—for
      how little the new government will even try to do. She goes further and defines
      her key goal as “unlocking private investment.” Even the words she chooses mirror
      what the old Conservatives want to hear and would themselves say. In declining
      capitalisms, electoral changes can and often do serve to avoid or at least postpone
      real change.


      Chancellor Reeves’s words assure major corporations and the 1 percent they enrich
      that Starmer’s Labour Party will not heavily tax them. This matters since it is
      precisely in major corporations and the rich that “a lot of money” is located.
      The wealth of the top 1 percent could easily fund a genuinely democratic rebuilding
      of a seriously depleted post-2008 UK economy. In stark contrast, the typical Conservative
      programs prioritizing private investment are what got the UK to its present sad
      state. They were the problem; they are not the solution.


      The Labour Party was once socialist. Socialism once meant a thoroughgoing critique
      of the capitalist system and advocacy of something totally different. Socialists
      sought electoral victories to win government power and use it to transition society
      to a post-capitalist order. But today’s Labour Party has thrown that history away.
      It wants to administer contemporary British capitalism just a bit less harshly
      than Conservatives do. It works to persuade the British working class that “less
      harsh” is the best they can hope and vote for. And British Conservatives can indeed
      smile and condescendingly approve such a Labour Party or else quibble with it
      over how much harshness today’s capitalism “needs.”


      Macron, also once a socialist, plays a similar role in France. Indeed, so do Biden
      and Trump in the United States, Justin Trudeau in Canada, and Olaf Scholz in Germany.
      All offer administrations of their contemporary capitalisms. None have programs
      aimed at solving modern capitalisms’ basic, accumulated, and persistently unsolved
      problems. Solutions would require first admitting what those problems are: cyclically
      recurring instability, increasingly unequal distributions of income and wealth,
      monied corruption of politics, mass media, and culture, and increasingly oppressive
      foreign policies that fail to offset a declining Western capitalism. Insistent
      denial across the collective West precludes admitting those problems, let alone
      fashioning solutions to them woven into programs for real change. Alternative
      governments administer; they dare not lead. Would a Kamala Harris-Tim Walz regime
      break with this pattern?


      Their administrations will experiment with and perhaps oscillate between free-trade
      and protectionist policies—as past capitalist governments often did. In the United
      States, recent GOP and Democrat steps toward economic nationalism remain vote-seeking
      exceptions to still widespread commitments to neoliberal globalization. Western
      megacorporations, including many based in the United States, welcome China’s new
      role as the global champion of free trade (even as it retaliates moderately against
      tariffs and trade wars initiated by the collective West). Support remains strong
      for negotiations to shape generally acceptable global divisions of trade and investment
      flows. The latter are seen as profitable as well as a means to avoid dangerous
      wars. Elections will continue to include clashes between capitalism’s free-trade
      and protectionist tendencies.


      But the more fundamental issue of 2024 elections is mass anger in the collective
      West aroused by its historic decline and the effects of that decline on the mass
      of average citizens. How will that anger shape the elections?


      The more extreme right wing recognizes and rides the deeper anger without, of
      course, grasping its relationship to capitalism. Marine Le Pen, Nigel Farage,
      and Trump are all examples. They all mock and deride the center-left and center-right
      governments that merely administer what they depict as a sinking ship that needs
      new, different leadership. But their donor base (capitalist) and long-standing
      ideology (pro-capitalist) block them from going beyond extreme scapegoating (of
      immigrants, ethnic minorities, heterodox sexualities, and foreign demons).


      The mainstream media likewise cannot grasp the relationship of mass anger to capitalism.
      Thus they dismiss the anger as irrational or caused by inadequate “messaging”
      from mainstream influencers. For many months, mainstream economic pundits have
      bemoaned the “strange” coexistence of a “great economy” and polls showing mass
      disappointment at the “bad” economy. By “strange” they mean “stupid” or “ignorant”
      or “politically-motivated/dishonest”: sets of words often condensed into “populist.”


      The left is jealous of the extreme right’s significant mass base now in working-class
      areas. In most countries, the left has spent the last many decades trying to hold
      on to its working-class base as the mainstream’s center-left movement pulled it
      away. That meant a greater or lesser shift from communist and anarchist to ever
      more “moderate” socialist and democratic affiliations. That shift included downplaying
      the goal of a comprehensively different post-capitalism in favor of the immediate
      goal of a state-fostered softer, humane capitalism where wages and benefits were
      greater, taxes more progressive, cycles more regulated, and minorities less oppressed.
      For that left, what mass anger it could recognize flowed from failures to achieve
      such a state-fostered softer capitalism, not from Western capitalism’s decline.


      As capitalism’s dynamic center moved to Asia and elsewhere in the global South,
      decline set in among its old, more-or-less abandoned centers. Old center capitalists
      participated in and profited greatly as the system relocated its dynamic center.
      Capitalists, both state and private, in the new centers profited even more. In
      the old centers, the rich and powerful shifted the burdens of decline onto the
      masses. In the new centers, the rich and powerful gathered the new capitalist
      wealth there mostly into their hands but with enough trickling down to satisfy
      large portions of their working classes. That’s how capitalism works and always
      has. For the mass of employees, however, the ride upwards when capitalism’s dynamic
      center is where they work and live is far more pleasant and hopeful than when
      decline sets in. The ride down provokes depression and traumas. When they fester
      without admission or discussion, they often morph into anger.'
    one_sentence_summary: In the aftermath of significant electoral defeats for centrist
      leaders like Emmanuel Macron and Rishi Sunak, the article argues that mainstream
      politicians fail to genuinely understand or address the deep-rooted anger stemming
      from the decline of Western capitalism, instead opting to blame opponents and
      mobilize anger through scapegoating, while the left struggles to connect this
      anger to a broader critique of capitalism itself.
    paragraph_summary: Following significant electoral defeats in 2024, leaders like
      French President Emmanuel Macron and UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak acknowledged
      public anger but failed to address its deeper roots, reflecting a broader trend
      among mainstream politicians in the West who prioritize regaining power over understanding
      the underlying issues. This anger, particularly among supporters of the MAGA movement,
      may stem from a collective sense of victimization linked to the decline of Western
      capitalism, which is increasingly overshadowed by rising economic powers like
      China. Despite the evident struggles of capitalism—marked by inequality, political
      corruption, and social unrest—politicians across the spectrum continue to offer
      superficial solutions while avoiding a candid discussion of capitalism's failures.
      The left, in particular, struggles to connect mass anger to the systemic issues
      of capitalism, often focusing instead on immediate reforms rather than a fundamental
      critique of the capitalist system itself. As Western capitalism faces decline,
      the rich and powerful shift the burdens onto the masses, leading to a growing
      disconnect and skepticism towards government, while right-wing populists exploit
      this anger without addressing its true causes. Ultimately, the article argues
      that without acknowledging the relationship between mass anger and capitalism's
      decline, political movements on both the left and right will continue to misinterpret
      and mismanage the discontent of the populace

  - title: Capitalism’s Unequal Distribution Deprives You of True Freedom
    url: https://www.counterpunch.org/2024/08/09/capitalisms-unequal-distribution-deprives-you-of-true-freedom/
    text: 'As the French economist Thomas Piketty most recently exposed, capitalism,
      across time and space, has always tended to produce ever-greater economic inequality.
      Oxfam, a global charity, reported that 2022’s 10 richest men together had six
      times more wealth than the poorest 3.1 billion people on earth. The lack of democracy
      inside workplaces or enterprises is both a cause and an effect of capitalism’s
      unequal distribution of income and wealth.


      Of course, inequality predates capitalism. Powerful feudal lords across Europe
      had blended autocracy with unequal distributions of wealth on their manorial estates.
      In fact, the largest and most powerful among the lords—the one named king—was
      usually also the richest. Although revolts against monarchy eventually retired
      most kings and queens (one way or another), similarly rich dictators reemerged
      inside capitalist enterprises as major shareholders and CEOs. Nowadays, their
      palaces imitate the grandeur of kings’ castles. The fortunes of kings and top
      CEOs are similarly extreme and attract the same kind of envy, adulation, and reverence.
      They also draw the same criticism. Inequalities that marked the economy, politics,
      and culture of European feudalism reappeared in capitalism despite the intentions
      of many who revolted against feudalism. The problem: the employer/employee relationship
      is far less a break from the master/slave and lord/serf relations of production
      than capitalism’s champions had hoped for, assumed, and promised in order to secure
      mass support for their revolutions against slavery and feudalism.


      The employer/employee relationship that defines capitalism has created staggering
      inequality by allowing the employer full control over production’s surplus. In
      the past, inequality provoked references to rich capitalists, variously, as “robber
      barons” or as “captains of industry” (depending on the public’s feelings about
      them). Today, they’re referred to as “the rich” or sometimes “the superrich.”


      Is it true that everyone is free in a capitalist system? The answer depends on
      what is meant by “free.” Compare the freedom of Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, or other
      rich capitalists with your freedom. Capitalism distributes some income to you
      and some to Musk, Bezos, and the other rich capitalists. However, to say that
      capitalism makes each of you free ignores the reality that capitalism’s unequal
      distribution of wealth makes you unfree relative to Musk, Bezos, and the other
      rich capitalists.


      Freedom was never only about keeping the government from bothering you; it was
      always also about being able to act, choose, and make a life. To call us all free,
      to use the same word for everyone, erases the very real differences in our access
      to resources, opportunities, and choices needed for life. Musk is free to enjoy
      life, going wherever he likes and doing almost anything you could imagine. He
      may work but need not. The financial cost of anything he might want or need is
      totally irrelevant to him. The overwhelming majority of Americans have nothing
      remotely like such freedom. To say that in capitalism, all are free, like Mr.
      Bezos is nonsense. His freedom depends on the resources at his disposal. You lack
      the freedom to undertake all sorts of actions and choices because those resources
      are not at your disposal.


      The freedom of the rich is not just different; their freedom negates the freedom
      of others. Unequal income and wealth always provoke anxiety among the rich. They
      fear the envy their wealth excites and invites. To protect their positions as
      systemically privileged recipients of income and, thus, accumulators of wealth,
      the rich seek to control both political and cultural institutions. Their goal
      is to shape politics and culture, to make them celebrate and justify income and
      wealth inequalities, not to challenge them. We turn now to how the rich shape
      culture to their benefit.


      Unequal access to culture is a feature of capitalism. Culture concerns how people
      think about all aspects of life—how we learn, make, and communicate meanings about
      the world. Our culture shapes what we find acceptable, what we enjoy, and what
      we come to decide needs changing. In European feudalism, access to culture for
      most serfs was shaped chiefly by what the church taught. In turn, the church carefully
      structured its interpretation of the Bible and other texts to reinforce feudal
      rules and traditions. Lords and serfs funded the church to complete the system.
      In modern capitalism, secular public schools undertake formal education alongside
      or instead of churches and other private schools. In today’s world, school education
      celebrates and reinforces capitalism. In turn, the state taxes employers and mostly
      employees to fund public schools and subsidizes private schools (which also charge
      students).


      Writers like Howard Zinn and Leo Huberman have penned histories of the U.S. showing
      that much of what standard school U.S. history textbooks lacked were accounts
      of the many class struggles against capitalism. Instead, rags-to-riches stories
      about people like Horatio Alger were popularized. Examinations of the roots of
      revolt and rebellion against low wages, bad working conditions, and all manner
      of hardship imposed on the workers of America, however, were not.


      In capitalism, mainstream media sources are themselves mostly organized as capitalist
      enterprises. They depend on, understand, and support profit maximization as the
      driving force of their enterprises. Their CEOs can and do make all sorts of definitive
      decisions about what is aired, how events are interpreted, whose careers blossom,
      and whose end. CEOs hire and fire, promote and demote. On mainstream radio, TV,
      and film, we almost never see exciting dramas about anti-capitalist revolutionaries
      who win the day by successfully persuading employees to join them. Rags-to-capitalist-riches
      dramas are, in comparison, routine storylines in countless mainstream media productions.


      In capitalism, culture is constrained to reinforce that system. Even individuals
      who privately criticize capitalism learn early in their careers to keep such criticisms
      private. Periodically, ideological battles can and do break out. If and when they
      coalesce with anti-capitalist upsurges elsewhere in society, cultural criticism
      of capitalism has been, and can again be, a powerful revolutionary force for systemic
      change. That is why defenders of the capitalist system instinctually and ceaselessly
      shape politics, economics, and culture to reinforce that system.


      Capitalism has often undermined democracy and equality because doing so has reinforced
      and actually strengthened the capitalist organization of the economy. As an example
      of capitalism’s corruption of democracy and equality, we consider the mid-American
      town of Kalamazoo, Michigan.


      As in so many other U.S. cities, Kalamazoo’s corporations and its rich have used
      their wealth and power to become richer and more powerful. By donating to politicians,
      threatening to take their businesses elsewhere, and hiring better lawyers than
      the city could afford, the rich reduced the amount of taxes they needed to pay
      to the local government. The rich funded costly, broadly targeted anti-tax campaigns
      that found a receptive audience among the already-overtaxed average citizens.
      Once deprived of the tax revenue from the rich, local politicians either (1) shifted
      more of the tax burden onto average citizens, (2) cut public services in the short
      run, and/or (3) borrowed money and thereby risked having to cut public services
      in the longer run to service city debts. Among those they borrowed from were sometimes
      the same corporations and the rich whose taxes had been reduced after they funded
      successful anti-tax campaigns.


      Eventually, the city saw an accumulation of resident complaints about steadily
      cut public services (uncollected garbage, neglected streets, and deteriorated
      schools), alongside rising taxes and government fees. This litany is familiar
      in many U.S. cities. Eventually, upper- and middle-income residents started to
      leave. That worsened the existing set of problems, so even more people left. Then,
      two of Kalamazoo’s wealthiest and most powerful capitalists—William U. Parfet
      and William D. Johnston—developed a solution they promoted to “save our city.”


      Parfet and Johnston established the “Foundation for Excellence in Kalamazoo.”
      They contributed, according to reports, over $25 million annually to it. Since
      such foundations usually qualify for tax-exempt status at federal, state, and
      local levels of government, the two gentlemen’s contributions lowered their personal
      tax bills. More importantly, the two could wield outsize local political influence.
      They would have much to say about how their foundation funded public services
      in Kalamazoo. In this city, the old democratic notion of everyone paying taxes
      to share in funding the public well-being was replaced by private charity. Public,
      reasonably transparent accountability was replaced by the less transparent, murkier
      foundation activities. Public accountability faded as the private whims of private
      foundations took over.


      What used to be called a “company town” (when a major employer substituted its
      rule for any democratic town rule) often amounted, in the words of PBS, to “slavery
      by another name.” In their modern form, they appear as “foundation cities.” Old
      company towns were rejected nearly everywhere across U.S. history. But, as the
      Kalamazoo example shows, they have returned with names changed.


      While capitalism’s general tendency is toward ever-greater inequality, occasional
      redistributions of wealth have happened. These moments have come to be called
      “reforms” and include progressive taxation of income and wealth, welfare entitlements,
      and minimum wage legislation. Redistributive reforms usually occur when middle-income
      and poor people stop tolerating deepening inequality. The biggest and most important
      example in U.S. history was the Great Depression of the 1930s. The New Deal policies
      of the federal government then drastically reduced the inequality of wealth and
      income distribution. Yet employers and the rich have never ceased their opposition
      to new redistributions and their efforts to undo old ones. U.S. politicians learn
      early in their careers what results when they advocate for redistributive reforms:
      an avalanche of criticism coupled with shifts of donors to their political opponents.
      Thus, in the U.S., after the end of World War II in 1945, the employer class changed
      the policies of the federal government. Over the past 80 years, most of what the
      New Deal won has been undone.


      Corporations and the rich hire accountants skilled in hiding money in foreign
      and domestic places that evade reporting to the U.S. Internal Revenue Service.
      Called “tax havens,” those hiding places keep funds that remain untouched by tax
      collectors. In 2013, Oxfam published findings that the trillions stashed away
      in tax havens could end extreme world poverty—twice over. Yet since the revelation
      of this shocking statistic, the inequality of wealth and income has become more
      extreme in nearly every nation on earth. Tax havens persist.


      Conflicts over income, wealth distribution, and wealth redistribution are thus
      intrinsic to capitalism and always have been. Occasionally they become violent
      and socially disruptive. They may trigger demands for system change. They may
      function as catalysts for revolutions.


      No “solution” to struggles over income and wealth redistribution in capitalism
      was ever found. The reason for that is a system that increasingly enriches a small
      group. The logical response—proposing that income and wealth be distributed more
      equally in the first place—was usually taboo. It was thus largely ignored. The
      French revolutionaries of 1789, who promised “liberty, equality, and fraternity”
      with the transition from feudalism to capitalism, failed. They got that transition,
      but not equality. Marx explained the failure to achieve the promised equality
      resulted from capitalism’s core structure of employer and employee preventing
      equality. In Marx’s view, inequality is inseparable from capitalism and will persist
      until the transition to another system.


      This adapted excerpt from Richard D. Wolff’s book Understanding Capitalism (Democracy
      at Work, 2024) was produced by Economy for All, a project of the Independent Media
      Institute.'
    one_sentence_summary: The article argues that capitalism inherently fosters economic
      inequality, as evidenced by the vast wealth disparity between the richest individuals
      and the poorest populations, and highlights how this inequality is perpetuated
      through undemocratic workplace structures, cultural narratives, and the influence
      of wealthy elites on political and social systems, ultimately undermining true
      freedom and democracy for the majority.
    paragraph_summary: The article discusses the inherent tendency of capitalism to
      generate increasing economic inequality, as highlighted by economist Thomas Piketty
      and supported by Oxfam's findings on wealth distribution. It argues that the employer-employee
      relationship within capitalism mirrors historical systems of inequality, such
      as feudalism, where a small elite controls significant resources, leading to a
      stark disparity in freedom and opportunities between the wealthy and the average
      person. The author critiques how capitalism undermines democracy and public accountability,
      exemplified by the case of Kalamazoo, Michigan, where wealthy individuals exert
      disproportionate influence over public services through private foundations, effectively
      replacing collective responsibility with private charity. Despite occasional redistributive
      reforms, the article asserts that the structural inequalities of capitalism remain
      entrenched, with the rich continuously resisting efforts to redistribute wealth.
      Ultimately, it suggests that true equality is unattainable within the capitalist
      framework, as highlighted by Marx's analysis of the system's core dynamics.

  - title: The Undemocratic Reality of Capitalism
    url: https://www.counterpunch.org/2024/08/06/the-undemocratic-reality-of-capitalism/
    text: 'Fans of capitalism like to say it is democratic or that it supports democracy.
      Some have stretched language so far as to literally equate capitalism with democracy,
      using the terms interchangeably. No matter how many times that is repeated, it
      is simply not true and never was. Indeed, it is much more accurate to say that
      capitalism and democracy are opposites. To see why, you have only to look at capitalism
      as a production system where employees enter into a relationship with employers,
      where a few people are the boss, and most people simply work doing what they are
      told to do. That relationship is not democratic; it is autocratic.


      When you cross the threshold into a workplace (e.g., a factory, an office, or
      a store), you leave whatever democracy might exist outside. You enter a workplace
      from which democracy is excluded. Are the majority—the employees—making the decisions
      that affect their lives? The answer is an unambiguous no. Whoever runs the enterprise
      in a capitalist system (owner[s] or a board of directors) makes all the key decisions:
      what the enterprise produces, what technology it uses, where production takes
      place, and what to do with enterprise profits. The employees are excluded from
      making those decisions but must live with the consequences, which affect them
      deeply. The employees must either accept the effects of their employers’ decisions
      or quit their jobs to work somewhere else (most likely organized in the same undemocratic
      way).


      The employer is an autocrat within a capitalist enterprise, like a king in a monarchy.
      Over the past few centuries, monarchies were largely “overthrown” and replaced
      by representative, electoral “democracies.” But kings remained. They merely changed
      their location and their titles. They moved from political positions in government
      to economic positions inside capitalist enterprises. Instead of kings, they are
      called bosses or owners or CEOs. There they sit, atop the capitalist enterprise,
      exercising many king-like powers, unaccountable to those over whom they reign.


      Democracy has been kept out of capitalist enterprise for centuries. Many other
      institutions in societies where capitalist enterprises prevail—government agencies,
      universities and colleges, religions, and charities—are equally autocratic. Their
      internal relationships often copy or mirror the employer/employee relationship
      inside capitalist enterprises. Those institutions try thereby to “function in
      a businesslike manner.”


      The anti-democratic organization of capitalist firms also conveys to employees
      that their input is not genuinely welcomed or sought by their bosses. Employees
      thus mostly resign themselves to their powerless position relative to the CEO
      at their workplace. They also expect the same in their relationships with political
      leaders, the CEOs’ counterparts in government. Their inability to participate
      in running their workplaces trains citizens to presume and accept the same in
      relation to running their residential communities. Employers become top political
      officials (and vice versa) in part because they are used to being “in charge.”
      Political parties and government bureaucracies mirror capitalist enterprises by
      being run autocratically while constantly describing themselves as democratic.


      Most adults experience working at least eight hours for five or more days per
      week in capitalist workplaces, under the power and authority of their employer.
      The undemocratic reality of the capitalist workplace leaves its complex, multilayered
      impacts on all who collaborate there, part time and full time. Capitalism’s problem
      with democracy—that the two basically contradict one another—shapes many people’s
      lives. Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, and the Walton family (descendants of Walmart’s
      founder), along with a handful of other major shareholders, decide how to spend
      hundreds of billions. The decisions of a few hundred billionaires bring economic
      development, industries, and enterprises to some regions and lead to the economic
      decline of other regions. The many billions of people affected by those spending
      decisions are excluded from participating in making them. Those countless people
      lack the economic and social power wielded by a tiny, unelected, obscenely wealthy
      minority of people. That is the opposite of democracy.


      Employers as a class, often led by major shareholders and the CEOs they enrich,
      also use their wealth to buy (they would prefer to say “donate” to) political
      parties, candidates, and campaigns. The rich have always understood that universal
      or even widespread suffrage risks a nonwealthy majority voting to undo society’s
      wealth inequality. So, the rich seek control of existing forms of democracy to
      make sure they do not become a real democracy in the sense of enabling the employee
      majority to outvote the employer minority.


      The enormous surpluses appropriated by “big business” employers—usually corporations—allow
      them to reward their upper-level executives lavishly. These executives, technically
      also “employees,” use corporate wealth and power to influence politics. Their
      goals are to reproduce the capitalist system and thus the favors and rewards it
      gives them. Capitalists and their top employees make the political system depend
      on their money more than it depends on the people’s votes.


      How does capitalism make the major political parties and candidates dependent
      on donations from employers and the rich? Politicians need vast sums of money
      to win by dominating the media as part of costly campaigns. They find willing
      donors by supporting policies that benefit capitalism as a whole, or else particular
      industries, regions, and enterprises. Sometimes, the donors find the politicians.
      Employers hire lobbyists—people who work full time, all year round, to influence
      the candidates that get elected. Employers fund “think tanks” to produce and spread
      reports on every current social issue. The purpose of those reports is to build
      general support for what the funders want. In these and other ways, employers
      and those they enrich shape the political system to work for them.


      Most employees have no comparable wealth or power. To exert real political power
      requires massive organization to activate, combine, and mobilize employees so
      their numbers can add up to real strength. That happens rarely and with great
      difficulty. Moreover, in the U.S., the political system has been shaped over the
      decades to leave only two major parties. Both of them loudly and proudlyendorse
      and support capitalism. They collaborate to make it very difficult for any third
      party to gain a foothold, and for any anti-capitalist political party to emerge.
      The U.S. endlessly repeats its commitment to maximum freedom of choice for its
      citizens, but it excludes political parties from that commitment.


      Democracy is about “one person, one vote”—the notion that we all have an equal
      say in the decisions that affect us. That is not what we have now. Going into
      a voting booth once or twice a year and picking a candidate is a very different
      level of influence than that of the Rockefeller family or George Soros. When they
      want to influence people, they use their money. That’s not democracy.


      In capitalism, democracy is unacceptable because it threatens the unequally distributed
      wealth of the minority with a majority vote. With or without formal institutions
      of democracy (such as elections with universal suffrage), capitalism undermines
      genuine democracy because employers control production, surplus value, and that
      surplus value’s distributions. For capitalism’s leaders, democracy is what they
      say, not what they do.

      opposed, as capitalist workplaces operate autocratically under the control of
      a few employers, who make key decisions without input from the majority of employees,
      thereby undermining true democratic principles.
    paragraph_summary: The article argues that capitalism and democracy are fundamentally
      opposed concepts, despite claims that they support each other. It highlights how
      capitalist workplaces operate under autocratic structures, where a small group
      of employers makes all significant decisions, leaving employees without a voice
      in their work environment. This lack of democratic participation extends beyond
      the workplace, influencing political systems where wealthy capitalists exert control
      through financial donations to political parties, shaping policies to protect
      their interests and maintain economic inequality. The piece emphasizes that true
      democracy, characterized by equal influence and decision-making power for all
      citizens, is undermined by the hierarchical nature of capitalism, where a wealthy
      minority dictates the terms of economic and political life, effectively sidelining
      the majority.

  - title: Tariffs Don’t Protect Jobs. Don’t Be Fooled.
    url: https://www.counterpunch.org/2024/07/12/tariffs-dont-protect-jobs-dont-be-fooled/
    text: 'Both Trump and Biden imposed high tariffs on imported products made in China
      and other countries. Those impositions broke with and departed from the previous
      half century’s policies favoring “free trade” (less or minimal government intervention
      in international markets). Free trade policies facilitated “globalization,” the
      euphemism for the post-1970 surge in U.S. corporations’ investing abroad: producing
      and distributing there, re-locating operations there, and merging with foreign
      enterprises there. Presidents before Trump had insisted that free trade plus globalization
      best served U.S. interests. Both Democratic and Republican administrations had
      enthusiastically endorsed that insistence. Dutifully performing ideological support
      duties, they stressed how globalization’s benefits to U.S. corporations would
      “trickle down” to the rest of us. Globalizing U.S. corporations used portions
      of their profits to reward both parties with donations and other electoral and
      lobbying supports.


      Our last two Presidents reversed that position. Against free trade they favored
      multiple government interventions in international trade, especially imposing
      and raising tariffs. Instead of advocating free trade and globalization, they
      promoted economic nationalism. Like their predecessors, Trump and Biden depended
      on financial support from corporate America as well as votes from the employee
      class. Many U.S. corporations and those they enriched had shifted their profit
      expectations in response to the competition they faced from new, powerful non-U.S.
      firms. The latter had emerged during the free-trade/globalization conditions after
      1970, above all in China. U.S. firms increasingly welcomed or demanded protection
      from those competitors. Accordingly, they financed changes in the political winds
      and shifts in “public opinion” toward economic nationalism.


      Trump and Biden thus endorsed pro-tariff policies that protected many corporations’
      profits. Those policies also appealed to those for whom economic nationalism offered
      ideological comforts. For example, many in the United States grasped the relative
      decline of the United States and its G7 allies in the global economy and the relative
      rise of China and its BRICS allies. They welcomed an aggressive counteraction
      in the forms of tariff and trade wars. Both corporations (including mass media)
      and their subservient politicians worked to build popular and voter support. That
      was needed to pass the tax, budget, subsidy, tariff, and other laws that would
      realize the shift to economic nationalism. A key argument held that “tariffs protect
      jobs.” A political struggle pitted the defenders of “free trade” against those
      demanding “protection.” Over the last decade, those defenders have been losing.


      These days, most candidates and parties perform this particular ideological task
      for capitalism: persuading Americans that tariffs protect jobs. Note, however,
      that over the 50 years before around 2015, the same parties and their candidates
      mostly performed the opposite ideological task. Then they denounced tariffs as
      unnecessary, inefficient, and counterproductive government interferences. “Free
      international markets” would, they insisted, be much better for workers and capitalists.
      However, we need not and should not have been fooled then or now. Neither ideological
      claim is true.


      Free trade profits some industries, but not others. Those that profit rely on
      exporting their outputs to foreign markets, invest there, or rely on importing
      products from there. Similarly, tariffs profit some industries (those they protect),
      but not others. As industries evolve and change, so do their relationships with
      international trade. Correspondingly, their attitudes toward free trade versus
      tariffs change.


      Capitalist economies almost always pit pro-free trade against pro-tariff protection
      industries. Their battles vary from open, public, and intense to quiet and under-the-table.
      Their weapons include bribes, donations, and other kinds of deals offered to politicians
      mostly by the employers in the interested industries. Both sides also compete
      to enlist the public and especially voter support—“public opinion”—in order to
      swing politicians their way. Employers on each side spend millions to persuade
      the employee class to support their side. Politicians usually split according
      to which side offers more donations threatens more opposition in the next election,
      or has spent more to shape public opinion. Each side seeks to prevail, to make
      government policies favor free versus tariff-protected trade. One way to achieve
      that is endless repetition by politicians, business leaders, journalists, and
      academics of one side’s perspective in the hope and expectation that it becomes
      “common sense.”


      Each side’s arguments are driven by their respective industries’ financial self-interest,
      not any shared commitment to the “truth” about tariffs versus free trade. As we
      show below, the truth is precisely that neither tariffs nor their opposite, free
      trade, necessarily protect jobs. At best, both protect some jobs at the cost of
      losing others. The truth is that we cannot know—and thus cannot measure—all the
      effects on profits or jobs caused by either free trade or protectionism. So politicians
      cannot know what the net effect on jobs will be of either free or protected trade
      policies of governments.


      A simple example can clarify the basic points. Chinese auto-makers currently sell
      high-quality electric vehicles (EVs), cars, and trucks, globally, at very competitive
      prices. Those EVs can be found on roadways around the world, but not in the United
      States. That is because, until recently, a 27.5 percent tariff was applied in
      the United States. For example, if a Chinese EV’s port-of-entry price was, say,
      $30,000, it would cost a U.S. buyer $30,000 plus the 27.5 percent tariff (an additional
      $8,250) for a total U.S. price of $38,250. Recently, President Biden raised that
      tariff from 27.5 percent to 100 percent, thereby raising the Chinese EV’s price
      for potential U.S. buyers to $60,000. The EU plans similarly to raise its tariff
      against Chinese EVs from 10 percent to 48 percent, thereby raising the price to
      potential EU buyers to $44,400.


      Those tariffs protect makers of electric vehicles inside the U.S. and EU precisely
      because those EV makers need not add any tariff to the prices they charge. Thus,
      for example, if EVs made in the U.S. and EU had cost $40,000, they would have
      been uncompetitive with the Chinese EVs priced at $30,000. Prospects of profit
      for them would have been grim. With the tariffs now imposed by the U.S. and proposed
      by the EU, their EV makers see profit bonanzas. Makers in the EU can raise their
      EV price from $40,000 to, say, $43,000, and still be cheaper than Chinese EV imports
      suffering the planned EU tariff and thus priced at $44,400. EV makers in the U.S.
      can raise their prices to, say, $50,000, sharply improving their profits while
      still outcompeting Chinese EVs priced at $60,000 (including the 100 percent tariff).


      Barring interference from other factors (possible automation, changing tastes
      for cars, and so forth), we may assume that the raised tariffs increased the profits
      of EV makers inside the U.S. and EU. We may also assume that those tariffs also
      saved jobs at those U.S. EV makers. But that is never the end of the story. EV
      jobs are not the only jobs affected by raised tariffs on EVs.


      For example, many corporations in the United States buy fleets of EVs as inputs.
      Many compete with corporations outside the United States who likewise buy such
      fleets as their inputs. The raised U.S. tariff seriously disadvantages EV fleet-buying
      firms inside the United States. Firms inside the United States cannot buy Chinese
      electric vehicles for $30,000 each. They have to pay much more for the tariff-protected
      U.S.-made EVs. In stark contrast, their competitors outside the United States
      can buy Chinese EVs at the far cheaper $30,000 price. It follows that those outside
      competitors can offer lower prices for whatever products they sell because they
      enjoy lower (because free of tariffs) input costs. Those firms will gain buyers
      for their products around the world at the expense of their inside-the-U.S. competitors.


      Jobs will likely be lost in such competitively disadvantaged firms inside the
      United States. While raising tariffs on Chinese EVs may have protected U.S. workers
      at EV producers inside the United States, it also deprived other U.S. workers
      of jobs in other U.S. industries competitively disadvantaged by the EV tariff.


      In our examples above, U.S. and EU makers of EVs can and likely will raise their
      prices because of tariff protection. In this way, tariffs tend to worsen inflations.
      Inflations in turn tend to hurt exports as rising prices lead customers to buy
      elsewhere. Reduced exports usually mean reduced jobs making such exports.


      Still more factors shape tariffs’ job effects. Often “forgotten” by tariff boosters
      are possible retaliations by affected other countries. Evidence already suggests
      retaliatory Chinese tariffs coming on imports of U.S.-made large-engine vehicles.
      If that happens, U.S. exports of such engines to China will shrink or end. Jobs
      entailed in those exports will also end, offsetting job gains from the U.S. tariffs
      imposed on Chinese EVs.


      Since China is the chief target of U.S. and EU tariff policies it is important
      to see how China can retaliate in ways that threaten large U.S. and EU job losses.
      China has now successfully surrounded itself with allies in the BRICS (a total
      of 11 countries). The economic damage inflicted upon China by U.S. tariffs incentivizes
      China to offset much or all of that damage by shifting to sell output instead
      to the world outside of the United States and the EU and especially to its BRICS
      partners. As China redirects its exports, that will also impact where its imports
      will be sourced. All those changes will affect many U.S. and EU industries and
      the jobs they sustain.


      Honest economists shrug and plead irreducible uncertainty when asked whether tariffs
      will “protect” jobs. No matter how hard-pressed or bribed to give a definitive
      answer, honesty precludes it. Nonetheless, politicians eager to get votes by promising
      that a tariff they impose will protect jobs can rest easy. They will easily find
      economists who will give or sell them the answers they want to hear. Trump and
      Biden did and do.


      The implications of this analysis for the U.S. working class are significant.
      The struggle between free traders and protectionists pits shifting alliances of
      capitalist employers against one another. One alliance of capitalist employers
      fights another to win the working class’s votes. Each side promotes its false
      narrative about what is the best policy for jobs.


      The working class should not be fooled or distracted by these free trade versus
      protectionism struggles among capitalists. Whoever wins them remains profit-driven
      first and foremost. The ultimate impact on jobs is not a priority for any of them.
      It never was. The working class’s interest in shaping the quantity and quality
      of jobs can only be genuinely prioritized if society progresses beyond capitalism.
      That happens when employees (running democratic worker coops) replace employers
      (dominating hierarchical capitalist enterprises) in the driver seats of factories,
      offices, and stores. When employees have become their own employers, they will
      make the quantities and qualities of a society’s jobs a key policy objective rather
      than a side-effect of policies focused elsewhere.

    one_sentence_summary: Both Trump and Biden shifted U.S. trade policy from free trade
      to economic nationalism by imposing high tariffs on imports, particularly from
      China, which has led to a complex interplay of job protection and loss across
      various industries, highlighting the nuanced and often contradictory impacts of
      such tariffs on the economy.
    paragraph_summary: The article discusses the shift in U.S. trade policy under Presidents
      Trump and Biden, who both moved away from decades of free trade and globalization
      towards economic nationalism characterized by high tariffs on imports, particularly
      from China. This reversal reflects a broader change in corporate interests, as
      many U.S. companies now seek protection from foreign competition that has emerged
      during the globalization era. While tariffs are argued to protect jobs in certain
      industries, the article highlights the complexity of their impact, noting that
      they can also lead to job losses in other sectors and contribute to inflation.
      The authors emphasize that the debate between free trade and protectionism primarily
      serves the interests of capitalist employers rather than the working class, who
      should not be misled by the narratives of either side. Ultimately, the article
      advocates for a shift towards worker cooperatives, where employees have control
      over their workplaces, prioritizing job quality and quantity over profit-driven
      motives.

  - title: A Professor on ‘Authorities’ Who Order Police to Crush Student Protests
    url: https://www.counterpunch.org/2024/06/03/a-professor-on-authorities-who-order-police-to-crush-student-protests/
    text: 'The Washington Post’s journalists recently exposed what many already suspected
      or knew. Donors from society’s richest 1 percent pressured university administrators
      and political leaders to use police and other means to crush peaceful student
      protests. The students wanted a change in United States and Israeli policy and
      action to secure an immediate ceasefire in Gaza. Growing numbers of faculty are
      joining the students’ protests. They too have been unjustly persecuted by the
      same “authorities.”


      Of course, the lawful role U.S. police are supposed to play is quite different.
      As “peacekeepers” police should act to make it safe for any and all sides of disputes
      over U.S. foreign (or domestic) policies to engage in free speech. When university
      leaders collaborate with police to shut down free speech, both abuse their power.
      Students around the world have confronted those abuses as have U.S. students in
      the past. Our students now confront them yet again.


      As a professor myself, I am embarrassed when university administrators justify
      calling in the police to “remove” students from university “private property”
      (such as lawns). They argue as if real estate concerns outweighed the education
      and public importance entailed by peaceful student protests on urgent, life-and-death
      public issues of the day. Real estate justifications also reveal university administrators’
      ignorance. Huge tax exemptions subsidize private universities in the United States
      with public money. They get expensive public services delivered to them gratis.
      The rest of the U.S. public pays the taxes that fund those public services. Likewise,
      massive government grants support general university purposes (added on to grants
      for specific academic research projects) for both “private” and public institutions.
      To significant degrees, all colleges and universities are publicly funded institutions.
      They are thus perfectly appropriate locations for public expressions of opinion
      about important public issues. University administrators try to hide slavish pandering
      to rich donors when they try fake “private property” excuses for calling the police
      on students. Punishing students seeking peace in Gaza brings deep and lasting
      shame on the universities who do that.


      The same applies to all those authorities who use the old “violence” ploy to cover
      their pandering. They pose as driven to prevent or end mostly unreal campus violence.
      Meanwhile, these same authorities mostly support real, infinitely worse violence
      in Ukraine and Gaza. In contrast, student protestors for peace in Gaza have every
      reason to avoid campus violence precisely because it risks dissuading some other
      students from joining them. Enemies of the protest try to associate it with violence
      precisely to constrain the protests’ growth. Years ago, university administrators,
      police, and politicians likewise wildly exaggerated the minimal violence they
      blamed on anti-Vietnam war protesters. Unlike those authorities, those protesters
      actually helped end that war and its horrific violence.


      Protests disrupt “business as usual” to open time and space for public discussion
      and action around an urgent public issue. That is why workers strike, marchers
      crowd streets for the rights of minorities and women, and vigils for peace gather
      at traffic intersections. In recent years, millions of French people wearing yellow
      vests shut down France to ask for social changes. In the spring of 2024, general
      strikers similarly shut down Argentina. Protesters explain why they want change.
      Their protests ask others to engage with the question of change.


      Protests also attest to a society’s social health: its ability to overcome the
      resignation, reticence, and fear that too often prevent or delay social problems
      from getting public attention. The absence of protest often drives urgent social
      problems underground. There they fester and eventually burst forth more disruptively
      than earlier protests would have been. Let protesters make their points. If counter-protesters
      wish, let them do likewise with their points. That is what “free speech” means.
      When the “authorities” in power fear the criticism, questions, and demands of
      the people they control, almost any public protests quickly become intolerably
      frightening to them. Their control is challenged and they react in ways that undercut
      their empty claims to be “democratic.” We all have a right and duty to affirm
      genuine free speech.


      The larger world is changing. The horrors in Gaza, the forming of a new, powerful
      student movement critical of U.S. foreign policy, and undemocratic efforts to
      stop free speech all flow from global changes. Our world is now fast becoming
      very different from what it was for most of our parents’ lives. Just as the British
      empire rose, peaked, and then fell, the American empire that followed it rose,
      peaked, and is now declining. Americans are only beginning to grasp that reality
      as denying it remains the majority’s position. Each of us confronts the changes
      in the world based on our own histories. Therefore, before drawing conclusions
      about Gaza and the student protests, I need to explain where I am coming from,
      my family’s history, and how it contextualizes my engagement with a changed and
      changing world.


      My mother and her sister were both incarcerated in concentration camps in the
      late 1930s (my aunt in a German camp, my mother in a French camp). Their parents
      (my grandparents) were killed in a different German concentration camp. My mother
      was born and raised in Berlin, Germany, and attended the University of Berlin
      until she fled Germany in 1936. My father, born in Metz (a disputed French/German
      city on the border), attended several German and Swiss universities, became a
      lawyer and eventually a judge in Germany before leaving for France in 1933. His
      sister was picked up by the Gestapo in Paris in the late 1930s and later killed
      in Auschwitz. Many other family members died in ways linked to fascism and/or
      World War II. All those who “survived” suffered severe traumas, often aggravations
      of other traumas they had suffered earlier in their lives.


      My parents, beyond surviving, additionally underwent the refugee experience in
      the United States. The English language and U.S. customs were largely unknown
      to them. They had no money. Their European professional credentials were not honored
      in the United States. When I was born, my father was a steel worker in a Youngstown,
      Ohio, factory, and my mother was a “homemaker” in that period’s words. As the
      first child of refugee “survivors” of multiple traumas, I was heavily pressured
      to “succeed” in the new country. My unspoken task was somehow to compensate for
      all the losses and injuries my parents always carried with them everywhere. I
      also listened closely to the snippets of information about fascism, Europe, World
      War II, and contemporary history that emerged from countless conversations in
      and around my family. This is the background for how I “relate” to the events
      in Israel, Gaza, and the United States over recent decades, especially since last
      October. “Relate” here includes confronting today’s student protests, their attempted
      repression, and writing this article.


      The uniform premise of discussions of fascism, war, and related subjects within
      my family was that they all represented the most recent of a long list of human
      tragedies across history. They could have happened anywhere and probably did.
      And they could happen and probably would happen again anywhere. Perhaps the best
      that we could reasonably hope for was that some sort of political action we might
      undertake now could reduce the probability, frequency, or horrors of future tragedies.


      For me, that meant I should seek to understand how societies work, act to change
      them, and thereby contribute to achieving the best that could reasonably be hoped
      for. Notions that any nation or region was uniquely prone to or immune from becoming
      Nazis were not taken seriously. Germany was in no way uniquely prone to nazification.
      Likewise, “denazification laws,” “civil liberty traditions,” or slogans like “never
      again” gave no nation immunity from becoming partly or wholly nazified. That included
      Israel.


      My father fought fascism as a student in Germany, then as a journalist across
      Europe, as a labor lawyer in Germany, and later as a naturalized U.S. citizen
      combatting the racism directed against African Americans and against Puerto Rican
      immigrants in New York City. He was respectful of Marxism as an intellectual tradition
      and a political movement but personally kept his distance from it. He was always
      a European left social democrat: comfortable in the United States of Franklin
      Delano Roosevelt (FDR) from his arrival in 1939 until FDR’s death in 1945. He
      became progressively more uncomfortable after 1945. He neither missed nor denied
      the rightward shifts of politics in the United States and Western Europe after
      1945. He sensed the maturation of conditions that could again enable new nazisms
      to emerge. He explicitly wondered about such possibilities, especially for a fascism
      to emerge and take power in the United States but also in other places including
      Israel.


      As my mother grew older, she mused often that “the Jews learned nothing from the
      Holocaust” and “the Jewish Zionists learned nothing from the Holocaust beyond
      ‘Better to perpetrate one than to suffer it again’.” My mother, 9 years younger
      than my father, had to leave the University of Berlin in 1936 after police identified
      her as a courier for the anti-Hitler underground. A frequently heard comment from
      one or the other of my parents: Jews have very often been the enemies and victims
      of nationalisms, often after long periods of living and intermarrying in neighborhoods
      where Jews and non-Jews comingled peacefully. What drove non-Jews to turn on Jewish
      neighbors were worsening economic and social problems affecting both Jewish and
      non-Jewish communities. In both communities, few identified the sources of their
      problems as capitalism, imperialism, and colonialism: the taboos against such
      reasoning were too strong.


      There were still too few Marxists to teach and explain the effects of capitalism.
      The Marxists and their allies that were active then analyzed social problems in
      ways and using terms heavily influenced by the Russian Revolution and the specific
      interpretation of Marxism promoted by the USSR. That interpretation became dominant
      over other, alternative interpretations because the unrivaled prestige of the
      first and only successful Marxist revolution in 1917 Russia made its interpretation
      dominant. Soviet Marxism defined capitalism as an economic system that combined
      private property (privately owned and operated enterprises) with free markets
      (enterprises and workers distributing goods and services to one another via exchange).
      Soviet Marxists and those who followed their lead argued that the capitalist system
      produced the inequalities of wealth and income, the instabilities of the “business
      cycle,” and the corruptions of politics by money that all together could lead
      to fascism and Nazis. In contrast, socialists proposed to advance beyond capitalism
      via (1) seizure of the state by the working class (by revolution or ballot victories),
      (2) state takeovers of enterprises, and (3) state planning instead of markets.
      They called such a socialism a rational economic system working in the interests
      of the majority working class rather than a minority capitalist class of owners.
      Such a socialism was the opposite, the antidote for, and the alternative to fascism.


      Meanwhile, the emerging Nazis analyzed society by focusing on altogether different
      concepts such as race and nation. They defined the social problem as national
      and racial in origin: the German nation/Aryan race was being victimized by the
      Jewish nation/race. My father quoted Engels to the effect that such antisemitism
      was the stupid person’s socialism.


      How had Germans in fact suffered (or, in Nazi terms, been victimized)? In and
      by the loss of World War I (1918), the huge reparations bill charged to Germany
      afterward, the worst inflation in modern European history that devastated its
      middle classes’ savings (1923), and then the Great Crash (1929) and its global
      Depression aftermath. German capitalists and the right-wing parties they funded
      took political advantage of all those events by deeming them victimizations. They
      blamed non-Germans for them: Bolsheviks from whom German socialists and communists
      had imported their evil ideologies. Nazis stressed the presence of Jews in the
      German left as their basis to rewrite history as a conspiracy to subordinate Germans
      (and others) to Jewish global financial rule. That project drew much inspiration
      from earlier writings across Europe accompanying antisemitic upsurges there. Casting
      Jews as thus a threatening race/nation, Nazis could mobilize Germans for their
      self-defense against the Jewish threat. Self-defense could and did justify repression,
      property dispossession, arrest, and eventually physical extermination of Jews.
      Similarly now for many Israelis, the war on Gaza is justified as an exercise in
      defense against Palestinians and the deep threat they are seen to represent. Aggressive
      U.S. foreign policies likewise refer to their military arm as the Department of
      Defense.


      Germany’s extreme problems after World War I culminating in the impact of the
      global Great Depression after 1929 overwhelmed its leaders. They found no traditional
      way forward as the mass of Germans became ever more desperate. Therefore they
      accepted the way offered by Hitler. His genocidal tendencies found a fertile ground
      that led to scapegoating especially of Jews. The Nazis filled the jails, concentration
      camps, and eventually the ovens and graves of Germany and many of its allies (Poland,
      Austria, Italy, Spain, and occupied France) with all their scapegoats.


      There was always opposition to Nazism. Alongside the Jewish opposition, there
      were also many others, especially among socialists and communists. Those oppositions
      suffered countless tragic losses but also proved spectacularly productive of heroic
      and productive breakthroughs in thought, association, and action. Those breakthroughs
      shaped world history after 1945. They helped to make us the critics of received
      norms of racial, gender, and class discrimination. In particular, they strengthened
      and transformed post-war anti-imperialism and anti-capitalism. Most colonialisms
      were overthrown by the colonized.


      My parents’ and their families’ traumas generated among the survivors a certain
      sympathy and empathy for the idea that Jews (and also LGBTQ+ people, the Roma,
      and others persecuted by Nazis) might finally and somehow find safety in the world.
      That extended to a romanticized early image of Israel—and especially its kibbutzim
      collectivities. But starting in the 1950s, as the kibbutzim declined and Israeli
      governments accepted ever more subordination to U.S. foreign policies, my parents’
      sympathies diminished.


      Qua religion, Judaism had been long abandoned not only by my mother and father
      but also by their parents. Those generations were proudly “free-thinkers” or what
      my father once called “post-religion.” Holding on to religious symbols and rituals
      at a time when they seemed ever more inappropriate, absurd, or worse struck them
      as unwanted modes of separation from the progressive tendencies of the larger
      society. Both my sister and I grew up and shared in that framework as have my
      children.


      The previous paragraphs sketch some context for how I approach the Israeli-Palestine
      conflict and U.S. student protests. The Israelis and Palestinians are trapped
      in a dead-end. Different as it is in most details from Germany in the 1930s, the
      Palestine-Israel conflict is similarly driven toward ever more deeply irrational
      objectives and strategies. For safety, some Jewish Zionists undertook a 20th-century
      settler colonialism in Palestine similar to what the British, French, German,
      and other European nations had undertaken in earlier centuries. Back then it was
      possible to “succeed” in military, political, and ideological terms in establishing
      and profiting from such settler colonialisms for long periods. There were centuries
      of time to ethnically cleanse indigenous people, to enable invading settler colonists
      to herd them into areas “reserved” for their impoverishment. Israel’s is the attempt
      much, much later to establish and secure a settler colonialism in radically altered
      historical conditions. Now most of the world’s people fight for and celebrate
      freedom from (ending) settler and other colonialisms. Their opposition offsets
      and now threatens to overwhelm the immense support Israel received and receives
      from the US and its shrinking number of other supporters.


      Colonial subjects always resisted and fought back against the colonizers. Resistance
      repressed went and grew underground. Periodically then it exploded into view surprising
      the colonizers with its ever deeper roots, persistence, and intensities. Eventually
      and everywhere, resistance to colonialism developed the self-consciousness, theories,
      organizations, and weaponry to overcome colonialism at least to the point of acquiring
      formal political independence. My own PhD dissertation sought to identify the
      roots overdetermining this process in Britain’s settler colonialism in Kenya.
      There, accumulated resistances and repressions peaked in the Mau Mau rebellion.
      It freed Kenya’s people by ending Kenya’s colonial status. Acquiring real political
      independence is the next step now engaging many formerly colonized territories.
      Real economic independence—as required by real freedom—is yet a further step now
      gingerly explored by China, India, and Brazil.


      Colonial history thus suggests the poorest of prospects for Israeli settler colonialism
      prevailing over a colonized Palestine. The conditions of existence for any such
      prevalence are not there now nor likely to emerge. Israel’s history thus displays
      repeated Palestinian uprisings and repeated Israeli repressions. Both become increasingly
      violent and vindictive. Stuck in a dead end, resistors and repressors resort to
      ever more extreme actions such as Hamas’s attack last October and Israel’s destruction
      of Gaza ever since. Israeli officials refer to Palestinians as “animals” and speak
      publicly about expelling millions of them from the country. Palestinian officials
      insist a genocide is being imposed by Israel upon them. Netanyahu’s allies join
      in banning and arresting opponents of his policies. How much further along that
      road will they go? U.S. students in response have given birth to a new mass movement
      that is changing the country as you read this.


      Hitler’s genocide ended when outside forces intervened to fight and win World
      War II. Inside forces (Jewish resistance, resistance to German occupation, and
      anti-fascism) helped in key ways. Will the forces already inside Israel and Palestine
      together with outside forces intervene and stop the Palestine-Israel catastrophe?
      Students and faculties at colleges and universities across the world are now in
      the movement for such interventions. Each of them is now making personal choices
      about whether and how to participate in that movement. Each person’s choice will
      affect the rest of that person’s life.


      Many students and teachers are at work trying to understand honestly how Palestinian
      and Israeli societies evolved, separately and in relation, such that they came
      to today’s horrific situation. They use classes, readings, and libraries seriously
      to interrogate concepts like “settler colonialism,” “apartheid,” “self-defense,”
      and “antisemitism/anti-Zionism.”


      Many students and teachers proceed unafraid to ask about how capitalism may have
      operated on both the Israeli and Palestinian sides—and among their supporters—in
      producing today’s dead end. The point of asking is to inquire further about an
      urgent issue: could basic social changes help overcome the Israeli-Palestine dead
      end by providing a new beginning on an economic foundation better than capitalism?
      Might the kibbutzim, had their numbers and importance within the Israeli economy
      been facilitated, have produced a different politics? Might the growth of worker
      cooperatives within the Palestinian territories have functioned likewise? Had
      such coops and kibbutzim built upon their shared economic structures to fashion
      political alliances, how differently might the whole Middle East have evolved?


      Yes, these are big, bold, new ways of thinking about the present, horrific dead-end
      in Gaza. Students and universities have often led the rest of society in such
      new ways. Yes, universities around the world now struggle with huge free-speech
      vs. police issues provoked by the Gaza events. But the old, defensive, aggressive
      ways of thinking and acting have more than failed to solve the Israeli-Palestine
      problem. They made it worse. Old defensive, aggressive ways of thinking also misunderstand
      a changed world, one in which the U.S. dominance coming out of World War II has
      now peaked and is receding. A declining empire is a new experience and context
      for everything else happening around us. Our generation is living through that
      process of decline. We need to think critically about historic dead ends without
      past generations’ fear of using anti-capitalist traditions of thought.


      The student and faculty protest movement around demands for a Gaza ceasefire is
      doing that. For that it deserves applause and to be joined. To the students now
      leading us I offer my gratitude.'
    one_sentence_summary: The Washington Post revealed that wealthy donors pressured
      universities and authorities to suppress student protests advocating for peace
      in Gaza, highlighting a troubling trend of prioritizing donor interests over free
      speech and public discourse on critical issues, while also drawing parallels to
      historical abuses of power and the importance of protest in a healthy democracy.
    paragraph_summary: The Washington Post recently revealed that wealthy donors have
      pressured university administrators and political leaders to suppress peaceful
      student protests advocating for a ceasefire in Gaza, a situation that has garnered
      increasing support from faculty members facing similar repression. The article
      argues that police should serve as protectors of free speech, not as enforcers
      of power against students expressing their views on critical public issues. It
      criticizes university officials for prioritizing real estate concerns over the
      educational significance of protests, highlighting that universities are largely
      publicly funded and thus appropriate venues for such expressions. The author draws
      parallels between current protests and historical movements, emphasizing the importance
      of dissent in a healthy society and warning against the dangers of repressing
      free speech. The piece also reflects on the author's personal history with fascism
      and trauma, framing the Israeli-Palestinian conflict as a contemporary manifestation
      of colonial struggles, and calls for a reevaluation of U.S. foreign policy and
      support for a new student movement advocating for peace and justice in the region.

  - title: A Class Analysis of the Trump-Biden Rerun
    url: https://www.counterpunch.org/2024/04/12/a-class-analysis-of-the-trump-biden-rerun/
    text: 'By “class system” we mean the basic workplace organizations—the human relationships
      or “social relations”—that accomplish the production and distribution of goods
      and services. Some examples include the master/slave, communal village, and lord/serf
      organizations. Another example, the distinctive capitalist class system, entails
      the employer/employee organization. In the United States and in much of the world,
      it is now the dominant class system. Employers—a tiny minority of the population—direct
      and control the enterprises and employees that produce and distribute goods and
      services. Employers buy the labor power of employees—the population’s vast majority—and
      set it to work in their enterprises. Each enterprise’s output belongs to its employer
      who decides whether to sell it, sets the price, and receives and distributes the
      resulting revenue.


      In the United States, the employee class is badly split ideologically and politically.
      Most employees have probably stayed connected—with declining enthusiasm or commitment—to
      the Democratic Party. A sizable and growing minority within the class has some
      hope in Trump. Many have lost interest and participated less in electoral politics.
      Perhaps the most splintered are various “progressive” or “left” employees: some
      in the progressive wing of the Democratic Party, some in various socialist, Green,
      independent, and related small parties, and some even drawn hesitatingly to Trump.
      Left-leaning employees were perhaps more likely to join and activate social movements
      (ecological, anti-racist, anti-sexist, and anti-war) rather than electoral campaigns.


      The U.S. employee class broadly feels victimized by the last half-century’s neoliberal
      globalization. Waves of manufacturing (and also service) job exports, coupled
      with waves of automation (computers, robots, and now artificial intelligence),
      have mostly brought that class bad news. Loss of jobs, income, and job security,
      diminished future work prospects, and reduced social standing are chief among
      them. In contrast, the extraordinary profits that drove employers’ export and
      technology decisions accrued to them. Resulting redistributions of wealth and
      income likewise favored employers. Employees increasingly watched and felt a parallel
      social redistribution of political power and cultural riches moving beyond their
      reach.


      Employees’ class feelings were well grounded in U.S. history. The post-1945 development
      of U.S. capitalism smashed the extraordinary employee class unity that had been
      formed during the Great Depression of the 1930s. After the 1929 economic crash
      and the 1932 election, a reform-minded “New Deal” coalition of labor union leaders
      and strong socialist and communist parties gathered supportively around the Franklin
      D. Roosevelt administration that governed until 1945. That coalition won huge,
      historically unprecedented gains for the employee class including Social Security,
      unemployment compensation, the first federal minimum wage, and a large public
      jobs program. It built an immense following for the Democratic Party in the employee
      class.


      As World War II ended in 1945, every other major capitalist economy (the UK, Germany,
      Japan, France, and Russia) was badly damaged. In sharp contrast, the war had strengthened
      U.S. capitalism. It reconstructed global capitalism and centered it around U.S.
      exports, capital investments, and the dollar as world currency. A new, distinctly
      American empire emerged, stressing informal imperialism, or “neo-colonialism,”
      against the formal, older imperialisms of Europe and Japan. The United States
      secured its new empire with an unprecedented global military program and presence.
      Private investment plus government spending on both the military and popular public
      services marked a transition from the Depression and war (with its rationing of
      consumer goods) to a dramatically different relative prosperity from the later
      1940s to the 1970s.


      Cold War ideology clothed post-1945 policies at home and abroad. Thus the government’s
      mission globally was to spread democracy and defeat godless socialism. That mission
      justified both increasingly heavy military spending and McCarthyism’s effective
      destruction of socialist, communist, and labor organizations. The Cold War atmosphere
      facilitated undoing and then reversing the Great Depression’s leftward surge of
      U.S. politics. Purging the left within unions plus the relentless demonization
      of left parties and social movements as foreign-based communist projects split
      the New Deal coalition. It separated left organizations from social movements
      and both of them from the employee class as a whole.


      Despite many employees staying loyal to the Democratic Party (even as they disconnected
      from the persecuted left components of the New Deal), the Cold War pushed all
      U.S. politics rightward. The Republican Party cashed in by being aggressively
      pro-Cold War and raising funds from employers determined to undo the New Deal.
      The Democratic Party leadership reduced its former reliance on weakening unions
      and the demoralized, deactivated remnants of the New Deal coalition. Instead that
      leadership sought funds from the same corporate rich that the Republicans tapped.
      The predictable results included the failure of the Democratic Party to reverse
      the rightward shift of U.S. politics. The Dems likewise abandoned most efforts
      to build on the achievements of the New Deal or move further toward social democracy.
      They increasingly failed even to protect what the New Deal had achieved. These
      developments deepened the alienation of many workers from the Democratic Party
      or political engagement altogether. A vicious downward cycle, with occasional
      temporary upsurge moments, took over “progressive” politics.


      That vicious cycle entrapped especially older, white males. Among employees, they
      had gained the most from the 1945-1975 prosperity. However, after the 1970s, employers’
      profit-driven automation and their decisions to relocate production abroad seriously
      undermined their employees’ jobs and incomes, especially in manufacturing. This
      part of the employee class eventually turned against “the system”—against the
      prevailing economic tide. They mourned a disappearing prosperity. At first, they
      turned right politically. The Cold War had isolated and undermined the left-wing
      institutions and culture that might otherwise have attracted anti-system employees.
      Left-leaning mobilizations against the system as a wholewere rare (unlike more
      single-issue mobilizations around issues like gender, race, and ecology). Neither
      unions nor other organizations had the social support needed to organize them.
      Or they simply feared to try. Even more recently the rising labor and union militancy
      has so far only secondarily and marginally raised themes of systematic anti-capitalism.


      Republican politicians and media personalities seized the opportunity to transform
      the disappearing post-1970s prosperity into an idealized American past. They carefully
      avoided blaming that disappearance on profit-driven capitalism. They blamed Democrats
      and “liberals” whose social welfare programs cost too much. Excessive taxes were
      wasted, they insisted, on ineffective social programs for “others” (the non-white
      and non-male). If only those others worked as hard and as productively as white
      males did, Republicans repeated, they would have enjoyed the same prosperity instead
      of seeking a “free ride from the government.” Portions of the employee class persuaded
      by such reasoning switched from Democrat to Republican and then often responded
      to Trump’s “Make America Great Again” (MAGA) mantra. Their switch stimulated Republican
      politicians to imagine a possible new mass base much broader than their existing
      mix of religious fundamentalists, gun lovers, and white supremacists. Leading
      Republicans glimpsed political possibilities unavailable since the Great Depression
      of the 1930s had turned U.S. politics leftward toward social democracy.


      Emerging from within or around the Republican Party, the new 21st-century far
      Right revived classic U.S. isolationist patriotism around America First slogans.
      They combined that with a loosely libertarian blaming of all social ills on the
      inherent evil of government. By carefully directing neither criticism nor blame
      toward the capitalist economic system, Republicans secured the usual support (financial,
      political, journalistic) from the employer class. That included employers who
      had never prospered much from the neoliberal globalization turn, those who saw
      bigger, better opportunities from an economic nationalist/protectionist turn,
      and all those long focused on the employer-driven project of undoing the New Deal
      politically, culturally, and economically. These various elements increasingly
      gathered around Trump.


      They opposed immigration, often via hysterical statements and mobilizations against
      “invasions” fantasized as threatening America. They defined government spending
      on immigrants (using native and “hard-working” Americans’ taxes) as wasted on
      unmeritorious “others.” Trump championed their views and reinforced parallel scapegoating
      of Black and Brown citizens and women as unworthy beneficiaries of government
      supports exchanged for their voting Democratic. Some Republicans increasingly
      embraced conspiracy theories (QAnon and others) to explain diverse plots aimed
      at dethroning white Christianity from dominating American society. MAGA and America
      First are slogans that articulate resentment, bitterness, and protest at perceived
      victimization. Repurposing Cold War imagery, Trumpers synonymously targeted liberals,
      Democrats, Marxists, socialists, labor unions, and others seen as close allies
      plotting to “replace” white Christians. Trump referred to them publicly as “vermin”
      that he would defeat/destroy once he became President again.


      The larger part of the U.S. employee class has not (yet) been won over by the
      Republicans. It has stayed, so far, with the Democrats. Yet aggravated social
      divisiveness has settled everywhere into U.S. culture and politics. It frightens
      many who stay within the Democratic Party, seeing it as the lesser evil despite
      its “centrist” leaders and their corporate donors. The latter include especially
      the financial and hi-tech megacorporations that profitably led the post-1975 neoliberal
      globalization period. The centrist leadership studiously avoided offending its
      corporate patrons while using a modified Keynesian fiscal policy to achieve two
      objectives. The first was support for government programs that helped solidify
      an electoral base increasingly among women, and Black and brown citizens. The
      second was support for aggressively projecting U.S. military and political power
      around the world.


      The U.S. empire protected by that policy proved especially profitable for the
      financial and hi-tech circles of the United States’ biggest businesses. At the
      same time, another part of the U.S. employee class also began to turn against
      the system, but it found the new Right unacceptable and “centrism” only slightly
      less so. The Democratic party has so far retained most of these people although
      many have increasingly moved toward “progressive” champions such as Bernie Sanders,
      Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez, and Cori Bush. Cornel West and Jill Stein carry similar
      banners into this year’s election but they insist on doing that from outside the
      Democratic Party.


      Hostility has intensified between the two major parties as their opposition has
      become more extreme. This keeps happening because neither found nor implemented
      any solutions to the deepening problems besetting the United States. Ever more
      extreme wealth and income inequalities undermine what remains of a sense of community
      binding Americans. Politics ever more controlled by the employer class and especially
      the super-rich produce widespread debilitating anger, resignation, and rage. The
      relatively shrinking power of the United States abroad drives home a sense of
      impending doom. The rise of the first real economic superpower competitor (China)
      raises the specter of the U.S. global unipolar moment being replaced, and soon.


      Each major party blames the other for everything going wrong. Both also respond
      to the declining empire by moving rightward toward alternative versions of economic
      nationalism—“America First”—in place of the cheerleading for neoliberal globalization
      that both parties indulged in before. Republicans carefully refuse to blame capitalism
      or capitalists for anything. Instead, they blame bad government, the Democrats,
      the liberals, and China. Democrats likewise carefully refuse to blame capitalism
      or capitalists for anything (except the “progressives,” who do that moderately).
      Democrats mostly blame Republicans who have “gone crazy” and “threaten democracy.”
      They erect new versions of their old demons. Russia and Putin stand in for the
      USSR and Stalin as chief awful foreigners with Chinese “communists” a close second.
      Trying to hold on to the political middle, the Democrats denounce Republicans
      and especially the Trump/MAGA people for challenging the last 70 years of political
      consensus. In that Democratic Party version of the “good old days,” reasonable
      Republicans and Democrats then alternated in power dutifully. The result was that
      the U.S. empire and U.S. capitalism prospered first by helping to end the exhausted
      European empires and then by profiting from the United States’ unipolar global
      hegemony.


      Biden’s plans pretend the U.S. empire is not in decline. In 2024, he offers more
      of the old establishment politics. Trump basically pretends the same about the
      U.S. empire but carefully selects problem areas (e.g., immigration, Chinese competition,
      and Ukraine) that he can represent as failures of Democratic leadership. Nothing
      fundamental is amiss with the U.S. empire and its prospects in his eyes. All that
      is necessary is to reject Biden and his politics as incapable of reviving it.
      Trump’s plans thus call for a much more extreme economic nationalism run by a
      leaner, meaner government.


      Each side deepens the split between Republicans and Democrats. Neither dares admit
      the basic, long-term declining empire and the key problems (income and wealth
      inequality, politics corrupted by that inequality, worsening business cycles,
      and mammoth debts) accumulated by its capitalist foundation. The parties’ jousting
      turns on substitute issues that offer temporary electoral advantages. It also
      reinforces the public’s incapacity for systemic critique and change. Both parties
      endlessly appeal to a population whose alienation deepens as relentless systemic
      decline worms its way into everyone’s daily life and troubles. Both parties increasingly
      expose their growing irrelevance.


      Neither party’s campaign offers solutions to systemic decline. Gross miscalculations
      of a changed world economy and shrinking U.S. political power abroad underlay
      both parties’ failed policies in relation to Afghanistan, Iraq, Ukraine, and Gaza.
      The turn toward economic nationalism and protectionism will not stop the decline.
      Something bigger and deeper than either Party dares consider is underway. Capitalism
      has moved its dynamic centers yet again over the last generation. This time the
      move went from western Europe, North America, and Japan to China, India, and beyond,
      from the G7 to BRICS. Wealth and power are correspondingly shifting.


      The places capitalism leaves behind descend into mass depression, overdose deaths,
      and sharpening social divisions. These social crises keep worsening alongside
      deepening inequalities of wealth, income, and education. Steadily if also maddeningly
      slowly, the rightward shift of U.S. politics after 1945 has finally arrived at
      social exhaustion and ineffectuality. Perhaps thereby the United States prepares
      another possible New Deal with or without another 1929-style crash.


      Hopefully, then, one crucial lesson of the New Deal will have been learned and
      applied. Leaving the capitalist class structure of production unchanged—a minority
      of employers dominating a majority of employees—enables that minority to undo
      whatever reforms any New Deal might achieve. That is what the U.S. employer class
      did after 1945. The solution now must include moving beyond the employer-employee
      organization of the workplace. Replacing that with a democratic community organization—what
      we elsewhere call worker cooperatives—is the missing element that can make progressive
      reforms stick. When employees and employers are the same people, no longer will
      a separate employer class have the incentive and resources to undo what the employee
      majority wants. Replacing employer/employee-organized workplaces with worker coops
      is the very different “great replacement” we need. On the basis of reforms secured
      in that way, we can build a future. We can avoid repeating the last half-century’s
      failure even to preserve the reforms imposed on a capitalism that crashed and
      burned in the 1930s.

    paragraph_summary: The article discusses the evolution and current state of the
      class system in the U.S., particularly focusing on the employer/employee dynamic
      that characterizes capitalism. It highlights how the employee class has become
      ideologically and politically fragmented, with many feeling victimized by neoliberal
      globalization, job losses, and diminishing social standing. The historical context
      of the post-World War II era is examined, noting the rise of the U.S. as a global
      economic power and the decline of leftist movements due to Cold War politics,
      which alienated many workers from the Democratic Party. As economic inequalities
      deepen, both major political parties have failed to address systemic issues, leading
      to increased polarization and the rise of far-right sentiments. The article argues
      for a fundamental restructuring of workplace organization towards democratic community
      models, such as worker cooperatives, to empower employees and ensure that reforms
      are sustainable, thereby avoiding the historical pitfalls of capitalism that have
      led to social crises and political disillusionment.

  - title: Empire Decline and Costly Delusions
    url: https://www.counterpunch.org/2024/03/08/empire-decline-and-costly-delusions/
    text: 'When Napoleon engaged Russia in a European land war, the Russians mounted
      a determined defense, and the French lost. When Hitler tried the same, the Soviet
      Union responded similarly, and the Germans lost. In World War 1 and its post-revolutionary
      civil war (1914-1922), first Russia and then the USSR defended with far greater
      effect against two invasions than the invaders had calculated. That history ought
      to have cautioned U.S. and European leaders to minimize the risks of confronting
      Russia, especially when Russia felt threatened and determined to defend itself.


      Instead of caution, delusions prompted ill-advised judgments by the collective
      West (roughly the G7 nations: the U.S. and its major allies). Those delusions
      emerged partly from the collective West’s widespread denial of its relative economic
      decline in the 21st century. That denial also enabled a remarkable blindness to
      the limits that decline imposed on the collective West’s global actions. Delusions
      also flowed from a basic undervaluation of Russia’s defensiveness and its resulting
      commitments. The Ukraine war starkly illustrates both the decline and the costly
      delusions it fosters.


      The United States and Europe seriously underestimated what Russia could and would
      do to prevail militarily in Ukraine. Russia’s victory—at least so far after two
      years of war—has proven decisive. Their underestimation stemmed from a shared
      inability to grasp or absorb the changing world economy and its implications.
      By mostly minimizing, marginalizing, or simply denying the decline of the U.S.
      empire relative to the rise of China and its BRICS allies, the United States and
      Europe missed that decline’s unfolding implications. Russia’s allies’ support
      combined with its national determination to defend itself have so far defeated
      a Ukraine heavily funded and armed by the collective West. Historically, declining
      empires often provoke denials and delusions that teach their people “hard lessons”
      and impose on them “hard choices”. That is where we are now.


      The economics of the U.S. empire decline constitutes the continuing global context.
      The BRICS countries’ collective GDP, wealth, income, share of world trade, and
      presence at the highest levels of new technology increasingly exceed those of
      the G7. That relentless economic development frames the decline of the G7’s political
      and cultural influences as well. The massive U.S. and European sanctions program
      against Russia after February 2022 has failed. Russia turned especially to its
      BRICS allies to quickly as well as comprehensively escape most of those sanctions’
      intended effects.


      UN votes on the ceasefire issue in Gaza reflect and reinforce the mounting difficulties
      facing the U.S. position in the Middle East and globally. So does the Houthis’
      intervention in Red Sea shipping and so too will other future Arab and Islamic
      initiatives supporting Palestine against Israel. Among the consequences flowing
      from the changing world economy, many work to undermine and weaken the U.S. empire.


      Trump’s disrespect for NATO is partly an expression of disappointment with an
      institution he can blame for failing to stop empire’s decline. Trump and his supporters
      broadly downgrade many institutions once thought crucially central to running
      the U.S., empire globally. Both the Trump and Biden regimes attacked China’s Huawei
      corporation, shared commitments to trade and tariff wars, and heavily subsidized
      competitively challenged U.S. corporations. Nothing less than a historic shift
      away from neoliberal globalization toward economic nationalism is underway. An
      American empire that once targeted the whole world is shrinking into a merely
      regional bloc confronting one or more emerging regional blocs. Much of the rest
      of the world’s nations—a possible “world majority” of the planet’s people—are
      pulling away from the U.S. empire.


      U.S. leaders’ aggressive economic nationalist policies distract attention from
      the empire’s decline and thereby facilitate its denial. Yet they also cause new
      problems. Allies fear that economic nationalism in the United States already has
      or will soon adversely affect their economic relations with the United States;
      “America first” targets not only the Chinese. Many countries are rethinking and
      reconstructing their economic relations with the United States and their expectations
      about those relations’ futures. Likewise, major groups of U.S. employers are reconsidering
      their investment strategies. Those who invested heavily overseas as part of the
      neoliberal globalization frenzies of the last half century are especially fearful.
      They anticipate costs and losses from policy shifts toward economic nationalism.
      Their pushback slows those shifts. As capitalists everywhere adjust practically
      to the changing world economy, they also quarrel and dispute the direction and
      pace of change. That injects more uncertainty and volatility into a thereby further
      destabilized world economy. As the U.S. empire unravels, the world economic order
      it once dominated and enforced likewise changes.


      “Make America Great Again” (MAGA) slogans have politically weaponized U.S. empire’s
      decline, always in carefully vague and general terms. They simplify and misunderstand
      it within another set of delusions. Trump will, he promises repeatedly, undo that
      decline and reverse it. He will punish those he blames for it: China, but also
      Democrats, liberals, globalists, socialists, and Marxists whom he lumps together
      in a bloc-building strategy. There is rarely any serious attention to the economics
      of the G7’s decline since to do so would critically implicate capitalists’ profit-driven
      decisions as key causes of the decline. Neither Republicans nor Democrats dare
      do that. Biden speaks and acts as if the U.S. wealth and power positions within
      the world economy were undiminished from what they were across the second half
      of the 20th century (most of Biden’s political lifetime).


      Continuing to fund and arm Ukraine in the war with Russia, like endorsing and
      supporting Israel’s treatment of Palestinians, are policies premised on denials
      of a changed world. So too are successive waves of economic sanctions despite
      each wave failing to achieve its goals. Using tariffs to keep better, cheaper
      Chinese electric vehicles off the U.S. market will only disadvantage U.S. individuals
      (via such Chinese electric vehicles’ higher prices) and businesses (via global
      competition from businesses buying the cheaper Chinese cars and trucks).


      Perhaps the greatest, costliest delusions that follow from a denial of years of
      decline dog the upcoming presidential election. The two major parties and their
      candidates offer no serious plan for how to deal with the declining empire they
      seek to lead. Both parties took turns presiding over the decline, yet denial and
      blaming the other is all either party offers in 2024. Biden offers voters a partnership
      in denial that the empire is declining. Trump promises vaguely to undo the decline
      caused by bad Democratic leadership that his election will remove. Nothing either
      major party does entails sober admissions and assessments of a changed world economy
      and how each plans to cope with that.


      The last 40 to 50 years of the economic history of the G7 witnessed extreme redistributions
      of wealth and income upward. Those redistributions functioned as both causes and
      effects of neoliberal globalization. However, domestic reactions (economic and
      social divisions increasingly hostile and volatile) and foreign reactions (emergence
      of today’s China and BRICS) are undermining neoliberal globalization and beginning
      to challenge its accompanying inequalities. U.S. capitalism and its empire cannot
      yet face its decline amid a changing world. Delusions about retaining or regaining
      power at the top of society proliferate alongside delusional conspiracy theories
      and political scapegoating (immigrants, China, Russia) below.


      Meanwhile, the economic, political, and cultural costs mount. And on some level,
      as per Leonard Cohen’s famous song, “Everybody Knows.”

      decline and the rise of alternative global powers like China and the BRICS, have

      evident in the ongoing Ukraine war and the shifting dynamics of global economic
      relations.
    paragraph_summary: The article discusses the historical patterns of military conflict

      resilience, leading to their defeats. It argues that U.S. and European leaders
      have similarly miscalculated Russia's capabilities in the ongoing Ukraine war,
      driven by delusions stemming from a denial of the West's relative economic decline

      led to failed sanctions against Russia and a shift in global economic dynamics,
      undermining the influence of the G7. The article critiques U.S. political leaders
      for perpetuating denial about the empire's decline, as both major parties offer
      vague solutions without addressing the underlying economic realities. The consequences
      of this denial manifest in increasing domestic and international tensions, as

  - title: What Is to Be Done?
    url: https://www.counterpunch.org/2024/01/11/what-is-to-be-done-8/
    text: 'In 1863, the Russian social critic, Nikolay Chernyshevsky, published a novel
      entitled “What Is to Be Done?” Its story revolves around a central heroine, Vera
      Pavlovna, and her four dreams. It brilliantly intertwines her personal life and
      the social turmoil of Russia’s transition at the time from feudalism to capitalism.
      Chernyshevsky, a revolutionary imprisoned by the Czarist government, wrote a novel
      that was nothing less than a pioneering work of socialist feminism. In it, he
      also passionately appealed for an urban, industrial economy based on worker cooperatives,
      a modern and transformed version of Russia’s earlier agrarian communes. An appreciative
      Lenin entitled one of his most important political pamphlets, published in 1902,
      “What Is to Be Done?”


      Two decades later, after the Soviet revolution defeated foreign invaders and domestic
      enemies in a long civil war, Lenin returned to the theme of worker cooperatives.
      In Soviet circumstances, much changed from Chernyshevsky’s Russia, Lenin argued
      forcefully for the USSR’s activists to recognize the enormous importance of building,
      spreading, and respecting cooperatives as key to Soviet socialism’s future. Worker
      coops, he argued, answered the burning political question among activists then:
      what is to be done? Here I want to adapt and apply Lenin’s argument to today’s
      social conditions that are raising that same question even more urgently.


      Today’s capitalism is global—the basic economic structure of the world economy
      features its core employer-employee model. The “relations of production” inside
      enterprises (factories, offices, and stores) position a small minority of workplace
      participants as employers. They make all the basic “business decisions” about
      what, how, and where to produce and what to do with the product (and revenue when
      they sell it). They alone make all those decisions. Employees, the majority of
      workplace participants, are excluded from those decisions.


      Capitalism today is also globally divided into two major blocs: one old and one
      new. The old is allied with the United States. Besides being older, the G7 is
      now the smaller of the two blocs, having shrunk in relative global importance
      over recent decades. It includes the UK, Germany, France, Italy, Canada, and Japan
      as well as the United States. The now fast-rising newer bloc, the BRICS, first
      included Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa. Recently, it invited
      six new member states to join, as of January 2024: Egypt, Iran, Saudi Arabia,
      Ethiopia, and Argentina. Since 2020, the BRICS’ total GDP exceeded that of the
      G7, and that gap between them keeps growing.


      The G7’s “mature capitalisms” all survived and grew because workers accepted the
      employer-employee organization of workplaces. Amid and despite the G7 nations’
      endless ideological celebrations of democracy, workers accepted the total absence
      of democracy inside capitalist enterprises. With some exceptions and resistance,
      it became routine common sense that representative democracy somehow belonged
      in residential communities but not in the communities at work. Inside capitalist
      enterprises, autocracy was the norm. Employers ruled employees but were not democratically
      accountable to them. Employers in each capitalist enterprise enriched a select
      circle by delivering portions of the revenue to themselves, to owners of the enterprise,
      and to a few top executives. That select circle wielded extraordinary political
      and cultural influence. It replicated the absence of democracy inside its enterprises
      by keeping the democracy outside them merely formal. Governments in capitalism
      were typically shaped by that select circle’s paid lobbyists, campaign donations,
      and paid mass-media productions. In modern capitalism, the kings and queens banished
      in earlier centuries reappeared, altered, and relocated, as CEOs inside ever larger
      capitalist enterprises dominating whole societies.


      Employees’ actual or anticipated opposition to democracy’s exclusion inside workplaces
      has always haunted capitalism. One major way employers can deflect such opposition
      is by narrowly defining their obligation to employees in terms of wages paid to
      enable consumption. Wages adequate for consumption became the necessary and explicitly
      sufficient compensatory reward for work. Implicitly, they likewise became the
      employees’ compensation for the absence of democracy within the workplace. Rising
      levels of employee consumption signaled a “successful” capitalism. In stark contrast,
      rising democracy inside the workplace never became a comparable standard for evaluating
      the system.


      Making consumption the point and purpose of work contributed to a social overvaluation
      of consumption per se. Advertising contributed to that overvaluation too. Modern
      capitalist society added “consumerism” to its catalog of moral failings. Clerics
      thus routinely caution us not to lose sight of spiritual values in rushing to
      consume (of course, those spiritual values rarely include democratic rights inside
      workplaces).


      Confronted and outcompeted by China and the BRICS, G7’s declining empires and
      economies now risk that mass consumption will increasingly be constrained. In
      declining empires, the rich and powerful preserve their wealth and privileges
      while offloading the costs of decline onto the mass of employees. Automating jobs,
      exporting them to lower-wage regions, importing cheap immigrant labor, and mass
      campaigns against taxes are the tried-and-true mechanisms to accomplish that offloading.


      Such “austerities” are now in full swing nearly everywhere. They explain a good
      part of the mass working-class anger and bitterness in the older (G7-type) capitalisms
      expressed in gestures against social “elites.” Given capitalism’s long favoritism
      shown to its right-wing versus its left-wing critics, it should surprise no one
      that the anger and bitterness first take right-wing forms (Trump, Boris Johnson,
      Wilders, Alternative for Germany, and Meloni).


      The political temptation for the left will be to focus again as it did in the
      past on demanding rising consumption now that a declining capitalism undermines
      it. Capitalism promised a rising consumption that it now fails to deliver. Fair
      enough, but that is not enough. Often in the past, capitalism was able to deliver
      rising real wages and workers’ living standards. And it may yet again. Indeed,
      China is now delivering just that.


      The clear lesson is that the left needs a new and different answer to the question
      of what is to be done. Its criticism must effectively criticize and oppose capitalism
      when and where it is delivering rising wages and likewise when and where it is
      not.


      Now is the time to expose and attack capitalism’s deprivation of democracy in
      the workplace and the resulting social ills (inequalities, instabilities, and
      merely formal political democracy). Workers’ goals never needed to be and should
      never have been limited to raising wages, important as that was and is. Those
      goals can and should include a demand for full democracy inside the workplace.
      Otherwise, whatever reforms and gains workers’ struggles achieve can subsequently
      be undone (as happened to the New Deal in the United States and social democracy
      in many other countries). Workers have had to learn that only democratized workplaces
      can secure the reforms workers win. What is to be done in the old, declining centers
      of capitalism is for class struggles to include the democratization of enterprises.
      A transition toward economies grounded on worker-cooperative enterprises is the
      strategic target.


      In the new, ascending capitalisms in the world, the BRICS, a different logic leads
      again toward worker cooperatives as a focal goal for socialist politics and organizing.
      Among the BRICS, the same employer-employee model organizes factories, offices,
      and stores. Unlike the G7, the employers are relatively more often not private.
      Rather, some employers run privately owned enterprises, while others are state
      officials who operate enterprises owned by the state. In the People’s Republic
      of China, where roughly half of enterprises are private and half public, nearly
      all have adopted the employer-employee organizational model.


      Where the state takes a large, major, or commanding role in economic development
      and especially where one or another socialist ideology accompanies and justifies
      that role, a turn toward a focus on worker cooperatives is now timely. It will
      attract many in those countries as socialism’s necessary next step. The “development”
      or socialism accomplished there—macro-level changes already achieved (via decolonization
      struggles and revolutions)—are celebrated but also widely understood as insufficient.
      Bigger social goals and changes motivated those struggles and revolutions. Democratizing
      enterprises takes “development” to a whole new level reaching toward those goals.


      There is yet another source of the answer that now responds to the question: what
      is to be done? The qualities of democracy that have been achieved within the G7,
      the BRICS, or most other countries, to date have been more formal than substantive.
      Where elections of representatives occur, the influences of wealth and income
      inequalities, the social power wielded by CEOs, and their controls over mass media
      render democracy more symbolic than real. Many people know it; still more feel
      it. Extending democracy into the economy and specifically into the internal organization
      of enterprises represents a major step in moving political democracy beyond merely
      formal and symbolic to substantive and real. And much the same applies to moving
      socialism beyond its earlier forms.


      The old cry to workers of the world to unify—“You have nothing to lose but your
      chains”—was an early, partial answer to the question: What is to be done? After
      a century and a half of development and socialisms, we can now provide a much
      fuller and more specific answer to that question. To get beyond capitalism’s core—the
      production relations of employer versus employee—we need explicitly to replace
      those relations with a democratized workplace, to substitute workers’ self-directed
      cooperatives for hierarchical capitalist business.

    paragraph_summary: The article discusses the historical and contemporary significance
      of worker cooperatives in the context of capitalism, drawing on the ideas of Russian
      social critic Nikolay Chernyshevsky and Lenin. Chernyshevsky's 1863 novel "What
      Is to Be Done?" highlighted the need for a socialist feminist approach to the
      social upheaval in Russia, advocating for an economy based on worker cooperatives.
      Lenin later emphasized the importance of cooperatives in the Soviet Union as a
      means to achieve socialism. The article critiques modern capitalism's employer-employee
      model, which perpetuates inequality and lacks workplace democracy, particularly
      in the context of the declining G7 nations and the rising BRICS bloc. It argues
      that the left must shift its focus from merely demanding higher wages to advocating
      for democratized workplaces and cooperatives, as this is essential for securing
      workers' rights and achieving substantive democracy. The author calls for a new
      socialist politics that prioritizes the establishment of worker cooperatives as
      a strategic goal to address the inadequacies of both capitalism and traditional
      forms of socialism.

    text: 'Democracy is incompatible with class-divided economic systems. Masters rule
      in slavery, lords in feudalism, and employers in capitalism. Whatever forms of
      government (including representative-electoral) coexist with class-divided economic
      systems, the hard reality is that one class rules the other. The revolutionaries
      who overthrew other systems to establish capitalism sometimes meant and intended
      to install a real democracy, but that did not happen. Real democracy—one person,
      one vote, full participation, and majority rule—would have enabled larger employee
      classes to rule smaller capitalist classes. Instead, capitalist employers used
      their economic positions (hiring/firing employees, selling outputs, receiving/distributing
      profits) to preclude real democracy. What democracy did survive was merely formal.
      In place of real democracy, capitalists used their wealth and power to secure
      capitalist class rule. They did that first and foremost inside capitalist enterprises
      where employers functioned as autocrats unaccountable to the mass of their employees.
      From that base, employers as a class purchased or otherwise dominated politics
      via electoral or other systems.


      Socialism as a critical movement, before and after the 1917 revolution in Russia,
      targeted the absence of real democracy in capitalism. Socialism’s remarkable global
      spread over the last three centuries attests to the wisdom of having stressed
      that target. Capitalism’s employee class came to harbor deep resentment toward
      its employer class. Shifting circumstances determined how conscious that resentment
      became, how explicit its expressions, and how varied its forms.


      A certain irony of history made the absence of real democracy in socialist countries
      an ongoing target of many socialists in those countries. More than a few socialists
      commented on the shared problem of that absence in both capitalist and socialist
      countries notwithstanding other differences between them. The question thus arose:
      why would the otherwise different capitalist and socialist systems of the late
      20th and early 21st centuries display quite similar formal democracies (apparatuses
      of voting) and equally similar absences of real democracy? Socialists developed
      answers that entailed a significant socialist self-criticism.


      Those answers and self-criticism flowed from a recognition that in both capitalist
      and socialist systems, business enterprises (factories, offices, stores) were
      organized overwhelmingly around the dichotomy of employer and employee. This was
      and remains true of private enterprises, whether more or less state-regulated,
      and likewise of state-owned-and-operated business enterprises. In parallel fashion,
      much the same was true in slave economic systems: the master-slave organization
      of productive activities prevailed in both private and state enterprises. Similarly,
      the lord-serf organization of production prevailed in both state (royal) and private
      (vassal) feudal enterprises.


      Real democracy proved equally incompatible with slave, feudal, capitalist, and
      socialist systems in so far as the socialist systems retained the prevailing employer-employee
      structure of their enterprises. In fact, the three kinds of modern socialist systems
      all display that employer-employee structure. Western European social democracies
      do so because they leave most production in the hands of private capitalist enterprises
      that were always built on employer-employee foundations. Moreover, when they established
      and operated public or state-owned-and-operated enterprises, they copied those
      employer-employee structures.


      Soviet industries—chiefly publicly owned and operated—positioned state officials
      as employers in relation to employees. Finally, the People’s Republic of China
      comprises a hybrid form of socialism combining a mix of both of the other forms,
      a roughly equal split of private and state enterprises. China’s hybrid socialism
      shares the employer/employee organizational structure in both its state and private
      enterprises. All three kinds of socialism—social democratic, Soviet, and Chinese—broke
      in many important ways from the capitalism that preceded them. But they did not
      break from the basic employer-employee organization of enterprises, that relationship
      which Marx’s Capital pinpoints as the source of exploitation, that appropriation
      by employers of the surplus produced by employees.


      All three kinds of modern socialism remain crucially incomplete in terms of having
      not yet gone beyond the employer-employee organization of production. It follows
      that socialists’ self-criticism—that actually existing socialist systems fell
      short of their standard of real democracy—may be linked crucially to those systems’
      retention of the employer-employee relationship at their economic core.


      Employers and employees are, together, defined by a specific class structure.
      They are its poles, the two possible positions individuals hold in production.
      They emerged with capitalism out of the disintegrations of previous systems. Such
      prior systems included (1) feudalism and its economic structure’s two positions
      of lord and serf, and (2) slavery and its economic structure’s two positions of
      master and slave. Because masters, lords, and employers are usually few relative
      to the numbers of slaves, serfs, and employees, and because they live off the
      surplus extracted from those slaves, serfs, and employees, they cannot allow a
      real democracy as it would directly threaten their class positions and privileges.
      In actually existing socialist societies, real democracy’s incompatibility with
      class-divided economic systems is encountered yet again.


      Because this time it is many socialists who make the encounter, they ask why modern
      socialism, a social movement critical of capitalism’s lack of real democracy,
      would itself merit a parallel criticism. Why have socialist experiments to date
      produced a self-criticism focused on their inability to create and maintain authentic
      democratic systems??


      The answer lies in the employer-employee relationship. It always was the key obstacle
      to real democracy, the cause and literally the definition of those classes whose
      oppositional existence precludes real democracy. Those socialists who faced the
      problem of real democracy articulated it as a definition of/demand for “classlessness.”
      Without classes, no ruling class. If the employees become, collectively, their
      own employer, the capitalist class opposition disappears. One group or community
      replaces two. Absent a class-divided economic system, efforts to bring real democracy
      to a society’s economy and politics could anticipate success.


      Socialist self-criticism can enable a solution to real democracy’s absence by
      advocating for a transition from an employer/employee-based economic system to
      one based on workers’ self-directed enterprises (or “worker coops” in common language).
      The incomplete socialisms constructed in the 20th century need to be upgraded
      by making that transition. That would get those socialisms nearer to completion,
      nearer to real democracy, and further from capitalist systems whose undying commitment
      to the employer-employee relationship precludes them from ever getting closer
      to real democracy.

      with class-divided economic systems, such as capitalism, socialism, feudalism,
      and slavery, where a ruling class (masters, lords, or employers) dominates the

      for a fundamental restructuring of economic relationships to realize the ideals

  - title: Why Capitalism Cannot Finally Repress Socialism
    url: https://www.counterpunch.org/2023/10/27/why-capitalism-cannot-finally-repress-socialism-2/
    text: 'Socialism is capitalism’s critical shadow. When lights shift, a shadow may
      seem to disappear, but sooner or later, with further shifts of light, it comes
      back. Capitalism’s ideologues have long fantasized that capitalism would finally
      outwit, outperform, and thereby overcome socialism: make the shadow vanish permanently.
      Like children, they bemoan their failure when, in the light of new social circumstances,
      the shadow reappears clear and sharp. Recent efforts to dispel the shadow having
      failed again, the contest of capitalism versus socialism resumes. In the United
      States, young people especially applaud socialism so much recently that think
      tanks like PragerU and the Hoover Institute at Stanford University urgently recycle
      the old anti-socialist tropes.


      In fact, the capitalism-versus-socialism contest does not really resume because
      it never really stopped. As changing social conditions changed socialism—a process
      that took time—it sometimes seemed to wishful thinkers that the systems struggle
      had ended with capitalism’s victory. Thus the 1920s saw anti-socialist witch hunts
      (especially the Palmer raids by the U.S. Department of Justice and the Sacco and
      Vanzetti persecution) that many believed at the time would extinguish U.S. socialism.
      What had happened in Russia in 1917 would not be allowed to sneak into the United
      States with all those European immigrants. The grossly unfair Sacco and Vanzetti
      trial (recognized as such even by the state of Massachusetts) did little to prevent—and
      much to prepare for—subsequent similar anti-socialist efforts by government officials
      in the United States.


      With the 1929 crash, socialism revived to become a powerful movement in the United
      States and beyond during the 1930s and 1940s. After World War II ended, the political
      right and most major capitalist employers tried once again to squash capitalism’s
      socialist shadow. They fostered McCarthy’s “anti-communist” crusades. They executed
      the Rosenbergs. By the end of the 1950s, once again, many in the United States
      could indulge the thought that capitalism had vanquished socialism. Then the 1960s
      upset that indulgence as millions—especially young people—enthusiastically rediscovered
      Marx, Marxism, and socialism. Shortly after that, the Reagan and Thatcher reaction
      tried a bit differently to resume anti-socialism. They simply asserted and reasserted
      to a receptive mass media that “there is no alternative” (TINA) to capitalism
      any longer. Socialism, where it survived, they insisted, had proved so inferior
      to capitalism that it was fading in the present and possessed no future. With
      the 1989 collapse of the USSR and Eastern Europe, many again believed that the
      old capitalism versus socialism struggle had finally been resolved.


      But of course, the shadow returned. Nothing more surely secures the future of
      socialism than the persistence of capitalism. In the United States, it returned
      with Occupy Wall Street, then Bernie Sanders’s campaigns, and now the moderate
      socialists bubbling up inside U.S. politics. Each time Trump and the far right
      equate liberals and Democrats with socialism, communism, Marxism, and anarchism,
      they help recruit new socialists. Socialism’s enemies understandably exhibit their
      frustration. With so little exposure to Hegel, the idea that modern society might
      be a unity of opposites—capitalism and socialism both reproducing and undermining
      one another—is not available to help them understand their world.


      Handling life’s contradictions has always, for many, entailed pretending they
      are not there. Very young children do something like that when they encounter
      a scary dog, cover their eyes with their hands, and believe so doing makes the
      dog vanish. With time, the children mature and grasp that the dog is still there
      despite hand-covered eyes. With time, too, adults will grasp that making the socialist
      other/shadow vanish is a capitalist project sure to fail. One effect of that failed
      project over the last 75 years is widespread ignorance of how socialism was continuing
      to change.


      Over the last two centuries, as socialism spread from Western Europe across the
      globe, it interacted with very diverse economic, political, and cultural conditions.
      Those interactions yielded multiple, different interpretations of socialism. For
      some, it was an evolving critique of capitalism, especially its injustices, inequalities,
      and cyclical instability. For others, it became the ongoing construction of an
      alternative economic system. More broadly, millions were brought to socialisms
      that aimed to change basic social institutions (family, city, government) that
      capitalism had subordinated to its needs. The different, multiple socialisms debated
      and influenced one another, accelerating change within them all.


      One kind of socialism that became prominent in the 19th and 20th centuries (and
      still exists) focuses on economics and government. It criticizes how governments
      are captured by the capitalist class and serve its social hegemony. It strategizes
      that using mass struggle (and eventually universal suffrage) can free the state
      from its subordination to capitalism and use it instead for transition beyond
      capitalism to socialism. In the 20th century, this kind of socialism offered a
      framework for constructing a socialist economic system alternative to capitalism.
      Such a socialist system entails the continuance of traditional capitalism: enterprises
      owned and operated mostly by private capitalists, individuals, or corporate groups.
      What it adds that makes it socialist is a government (often but not necessarily
      run by a socialist party) that closely regulates and supervises markets and enterprises.


      Such socialist governments aim to moderate key effects of private capitalism including
      its very unequal distributions of income and wealth, extreme business cycles,
      and unaffordable access by the general population to healthcare, education, and
      much else. Progressive taxation typifies socialist governments’ means of intervening
      in otherwise private capitalism. Moderate socialisms of this sort are found in
      many European nations, in the programs of many socialist parties around the world,
      and in the statements and writings of socialist individuals.


      Another kind of socialism shares moderate socialism’s focus on government and
      economics but differs from it by transforming many or all privately owned and
      operated enterprises into state-owned-and-operated ones. Often referred to as
      Soviet socialism—because the Soviet Union adopted it a decade after the 1917 revolution—this
      kind assigned greater powers to the state: to set prices, wages, interest rates,
      and foreign trade parameters according to a state plan for the economy.


      Because socialists around the world split over World War I and the Russian Revolution,
      one side (more aligned with the USSR) took the name “communist” while the other
      retained “socialist.” Soviet socialism was thus organized and operated by a state
      apparatus governed by the communist party of the USSR. Variations of soviet socialism
      in other countries (Eastern Europe and beyond) were established and operated similarly
      by communist parties there. The Soviet and other communist parties always referred
      to the Soviet Union as a socialist system. It was mostly the enemies of socialism—or
      those simply uninformed—that persisted in referring to the USSR as an example
      of “communism.”


      A third kind of socialism, comprising a hybrid form of the first two, is how the
      People’s Republic of China organizes its economy. There the Chinese Communist
      Party oversees a strong state apparatus that supervises a mixed economy of both
      state-owned-and-operated enterprises (on the Soviet model) and private capitalist
      enterprises (on the moderate socialism model). It is roughly a 50-50 split between
      state- and privately owned-and-operated enterprises in China. China had experimented
      with both moderate and Soviet socialisms since the 1949 revolution brought its
      Communist Party to power. Based on its critiques of both prior socialist models
      and the stunningly rapid economic growth achieved by the hybrid, a focus on fine-tuning
      the hybrid model seems settled policy in China today. The criticisms and opposition
      from both the Trump and Biden administrations have not changed that.


      A fourth model is newly important in and for this century even though examples
      of its way of organizing the production and distribution of goods and services
      exist throughout human history. People have often organized their collaborative
      production and distribution of goods and services as self-conscious communities
      within larger societies. Sometimes such productive communities were organized
      hierarchically with governing groups (councils of elders, chiefs, kings, lords,
      and masters) paralleling how they organized residential communities. At other
      times, they organized productive communities more horizontally as democratic cooperatives.
      A rapidly rising concept of socialism in the 21st century differs from the three
      basic models discussed above in its focus on and advocacy for the organization
      of workplaces as democratic, productive communities functioning within society.


      This fourth model emerges from a socialist critique of the other three. Socialists
      have acknowledged the lesser inequalities and greater economic growth achieved
      by the other models. However, socialists have also faced and considered when excessive
      powers were accorded to and abused by states and parties. Among critical socialists’
      analyses, some eventually concluded that previous socialisms focused too much
      on the macro-level of capitalist society and too little on the micro-level. Socialism
      cannot only be about the balance between private and state enterprises, about
      “free” versus state-regulated markets, and about market versus state-planned distributions
      of resources and products. That limitation can and should be broken. Failures
      at the macro level had causes at a micro level that socialists had too often neglected.


      When socialisms left the internal organizations of production and distribution
      enterprises inherited from capitalism largely unchanged, they made a major error.
      They left in place human relationships that undermined chances for enterprises
      in socialist economies to reach socialism’s goals. A truly democratic society
      cannot be built on a foundation of productive enterprises whose internal structure
      is the opposite of democratic. The employer-employee capitalist model is that
      foundational opposite. Capitalist employers are neither chosen by nor genuinely
      accountable to their employees. In worker cooperatives, by contrast, the employer-employee
      division is ended and replaced by a democratic community. The employees are likewise
      and collectively the employer. Their one-person-one-vote decisions, by the majority,
      govern what gets produced: how, where, and when. They likewise decide democratically
      what to do with the fruits of their collective labor, how enterprise revenues
      will be distributed among individual workers, and as investment funds and reserve
      funds.


      This fourth kind of socialism repairs the other three kinds’ relative neglect
      of the micro-level transformation of capitalism into socialism. It does not reject
      or refuse those other kinds; it rather adds something crucial to them. It represents
      an important stage reached by prior forms of and social experiments with socialism.
      Previous socialisms changed because of their results, good and bad. Those results
      provoked self-awareness, self-criticism, and determination to improve the emerging,
      new forms of socialism. Capitalism’s critical shadow returns again to challenge
      capitalism by inspiring a powerful new alliance of its victims with its critics.
      That has been, after all, the goal all along: to empower and inform social change
      beyond capitalism, to realize the slogan, “We can do better than capitalism.”

      in response to social conditions and crises. Despite attempts by capitalist ideologues
      to eradicate socialism, historical patterns reveal that socialism has consistently
      revived, particularly during economic downturns or social movements, such as the

  - title: 'G7 Versus BRICS: Power Struggles are Not Class Struggles'
    url: https://www.counterpunch.org/2023/10/19/g7-versus-brics-power-struggles-are-not-class-struggles/
    text: 'Class struggles interact with but are different from power struggles. The
      ancient conflicts between city-states Athens and Sparta were power struggles,
      while within each, slaves and enslavers engaged in class struggles. Britain and
      France were absolute monarchies in late European feudalism fully engaged in power
      struggles. At the same time, class struggles between lords and serfs internally
      agitated both “great” powers. Now, after slavery and feudalism have largely ended
      and capitalism prevails globally, great power struggles exist between the G7 and
      BRICS and among their member nations, as well as other nations. At the same time,
      class struggles exist between employers and employees in all nations. Power and
      class struggles condition and shape one another. Both have been and remain core
      aspects of history; so too have ideological habits of confusing and conflating
      them.


      Kaiser Wilhelm II, Germany’s monarch, said in 1914 as World War I began, “I no
      longer recognize [political] parties, I recognize only Germans.” He used nationalism
      to unify a class-divided Germany to help win the war. The Kaiser had been shaken
      by more than the increasingly serious struggles among world powers over colonies,
      world trade, and foreign investment. He was stunned too by the rise of Germany’s
      Marx-inspired Socialist Party across the decades before the war. Germany’s class
      of capitalist employers had been similarly shaken and stunned. For a country increasingly
      and deeply split between labor and capital, German nationalism was the employer
      class’s strategy both to thwart socialism and win the war. Key to that strategy
      was getting people to think (and self-identify) in terms of national and ultimately
      military struggles, and not class struggles.


      Germany’s strategy failed. It lost World War I, the monarchy ended, and its Socialist
      Party became Germany’s postwar government. Socialism emerged from the war far
      stronger in Germany than it had ever been. Much the same was true for World War
      I’s other combatant nations. More or less all of them had used nationalism to
      mobilize their war efforts and to undermine and displace class consciousness.
      For the war’s winners, nationalism may have served its purpose for them to achieve
      victory. Yet, it did not vanquish or banish socialism. Instead, socialism captured
      its first government (Russia) and split into socialist and communist wings that
      each drew mass attention and engagement. Both wings spread globally and quickly
      in the 1920s and even more in the 1930s as capitalism imposed its worst crash
      ever on most nations across the world.


      Now, a century later, power struggles intensify and sharpen across global capitalism.
      The power of the United States, hegemonic during the Cold War, is now declining.
      The earlier decline of Europe, punctuated by the loss of its colonies and two
      deeply destructive world wars, continues. Both Europe and the United States face
      the stunning, unprecedented speed of China’s economic growth and concomitant rise
      to global power status. Already, China’s network of alliances, especially the
      BRICS, confronts the United States and its alliances, especially the G7. The rise
      of China and the BRICS adds to their power struggles with the United States and
      the G7. That rise is also realigning power relations between the Global North
      and Global South and, in one way or another, among all nations and within international
      organizations.


      Class struggles have likewise continued in all societies, thereby evolving in
      different forms and foci. Most importantly, socialists now focus decreasingly
      on the struggle between private property and free markets as capitalism, versus
      state property and state planning as socialism. Many socialists reacted to 20th-century
      experiences with state power in the USSR and the People’s Republic of China by
      shifting their focus. State power and planning, while not dismissed as socialist
      goals, were seen increasingly as insufficient by themselves. Something more or
      different was needed to yield the post-capitalist system that socialists could
      and would embrace. Socialists refocused their priorities on the transformation
      of workplaces. Based on a critique of the capitalist hierarchy inside factories,
      offices, and stores—and its social effects—socialists increasingly stress proposals
      to democratically reorganize production there. Each worker in an enterprise will
      have an equal vote to decide what, where, and how to produce as well as how to
      dispose of the product (or net revenues where the product is marketed). The democratization
      of all workplaces (households as well as enterprises) becomes a central thrust
      of what socialism has come to mean.


      This kind of socialism grew out of but also challenged the macro, state-focused
      socialisms of the 19th and 20th centuries. Thus, where state-owned-and-operated
      enterprises continue to organize production around the employer-employee dichotomy,
      they invite socialists’ criticisms much as private-owned-and-operated enterprises
      do. The same applies to democratic socialisms or social democracies where enterprises
      remain privately owned and operated but are subject, along with markets, to heavy
      state supervision, taxation, and controls. Enterprises’ private versus state forms,
      important as their differences are for other reasons, often do not differ in class
      terms. Both typically display the employer/employee internal organization of production.
      If going beyond capitalism to socialism means a transition to micro-level workplace
      organizations that are democratic, then such transitions apply to both public
      as well as private enterprises.


      This newly emerging socialist focus challenges both the United States and China,
      the G7 and BRICS, despite the different balances of state and private enterprises
      among them. Further, the now fast (and thus dramatically) changing power relations
      among them have impacts on every nation’s class struggles. For example, G7 sanctions
      against Russia over the Ukraine war, and their inflationary impacts on Europe
      and the United States, have sharpened employer versus employee struggles as a
      result of those inflationary and anti-inflationary policies in many nations across
      the world. One of those policies—sharp interest rate rises by the U.S. Federal
      Reserve—is squeezing nations with large dollar-denominated external debts. The
      squeezed nations’ employers and employees react in ways that often intensify their
      class struggles.


      One major past and present problem has been the widespread tendency to confuse
      or conflate power and class struggles or else to see one and be blind to the other.
      Partly, these problems resulted from nationalist efforts, like Kaiser Wilhelm
      II’s, to repress class consciousness. While other problems emerged when cultures
      refused or rejected class consciousness perhaps because of their mass media’s
      dependence on capitalist owners and advertisers. Often both socialists and anti-socialists
      contributed to the confusion and blindness. That happened when the Cold War (1945-1990)
      and its lasting legacy effectively persuaded many on both sides to equate socialism,
      communism, and the USSR as one pole versus capitalism, democracy, the United States,
      and the “West” as the other pole.


      In today’s newly emerging international economic order, contending nationalisms
      are again strong. Power struggles once again capture headlines: U.S. versus Russia
      and China, the G7 versus BRICS, and the Global South versus Global North. Power
      categories not only displace class categories from analytical debates about major
      world affairs but that displacement also invades discussions about nations’ internal
      affairs. Power struggles are routinely mistaken for class struggles. Or class
      and class struggles disappear altogether from discourses.


      The rise and struggles of the BRICS against the G7 should not be confused with
      class struggles. No government among them is committed to replacing capitalism
      with socialism in the sense of transition beyond the employer-employee mode of
      internal workplace organization. Nor is any government among them committed to
      replacing capitalism in the older senses of moving systemically from private to
      public enterprise ownership and from markets to planning. Yet within all of them,
      there are groups and movements that are committed to replacing capitalism with
      socialism in accordance with one of its definitions.


      Karl Marx and others saw the conflict between the British Empire and its North
      American colony, culminating in the Revolutionary War and the War of 1812, as
      primarily a power struggle, and not a class struggle. Those wars did not pit slaves
      against enslavers, nor serfs against lords, nor employees against employers; they
      were power struggles. However, within them, moments of such class struggles did
      occur. The Napoleonic wars were power struggles, yet within them too, struggles
      of serfs against lords often occurred. The Napoleonic wars among feudal powers
      both weakened them all and stimulated capitalist classes to push for an end to
      feudalism across Europe. In the last two centuries of wars against colonialism
      and neocolonialism—power struggles—there were many class struggles interwoven
      with them.


      The power struggles now between the G7 and BRICS will interact with the class
      struggles going on within both blocs. The leaders, ideologues, and mass media
      of both blocs focus chiefly on those power struggles. The advocates of class change
      must clearly differentiate power from class struggles if they are to focus mass
      consciousness and activism on the latter. Thus, the BRICS bloc is surely challenging
      the G7’s and the U.S.’s hegemony in the world economy. The power struggle of competing
      blocs is not, however, a socialist movement challenging capitalism. Nor is China
      or the Global South now mounting such a challenge. The power struggles of China,
      BRICS, and the Global South against the U.S., the G7, and the Global North may
      provoke new class struggles as well as influence all those already underway. How
      they do so will depend in part on how we understand and engage with the difference
      between power and class struggles.

    one_sentence_summary: The article discusses the distinction and interaction between
      power struggles and class struggles throughout history, highlighting how contemporary
      global dynamics, particularly between the G7 and BRICS nations, reflect ongoing
      class conflicts within capitalist societies, while cautioning against conflating
      these two types of struggles in political discourse.
    paragraph_summary: The article explores the distinction between power struggles
      and class struggles throughout history, emphasizing that while the former often
      dominate headlines, the latter persistently shape societal dynamics. It contrasts
      historical power conflicts, such as those between Athens and Sparta or the G7
      and BRICS today, with internal class struggles, like those between employers and
      employees. The narrative highlights how nationalism has been used to suppress
      class consciousness, as seen in Kaiser Wilhelm II's Germany during World War I,
      and discusses the evolution of socialism, which has shifted focus from state ownership
      to democratizing workplace organization. The article warns against conflating
      power and class struggles, arguing that while current geopolitical tensions may
      provoke new class struggles, they do not inherently represent a socialist movement
      challenging capitalism. Understanding this distinction is crucial for fostering
      awareness and activism around class issues in the context of ongoing global power
      dynamics.

  - title: 'AI: Profit vs. Freedom'
    url: https://www.counterpunch.org/2023/09/25/ai-profit-vs-freedom/
    text: 'Artificial Intelligence (AI) presents a profit opportunity for capitalists,
      but it presents a crucial choice for the working class. Because the working class
      is the majority, that crucial choice confronts society as a whole. It is the same
      profit opportunity/social choice that was presented by the introduction of robotics,
      computers, and indeed by most technological advances throughout capitalism’s history.
      In capitalism, employers decide when, where, and how to install new technologies;
      employees do not. Employers’ decisions are driven chiefly by whether and how new
      technologies affect their profits.


      If new technologies enable employers to profitably replace paid workers with machines,
      they will implement the change. Employers have little or no responsibility to
      the displaced workers, their families, neighborhoods, communities, or governments
      for the many consequences of jobs lost. If the cost to society of joblessness
      is 100 whereas the gain to employers’ profits is 50, the new technology is implemented.
      Because the employers’ gain governs the decision, the new technology is introduced,
      no matter how small that gain is relative to society’s loss. That is how capitalism
      has always functioned.


      A simple arithmetic example can illustrate the key point. Suppose AI doubles some
      employees’ productivity. During the same work time, they produce twice as much
      as before the use of AI. Employers who use AI will then fire half of their employees.
      Such employers will then receive the same output from the remaining 50 percent
      of their employees as before the introduction of AI. To keep our example simple,
      let’s assume those employers then sell that same output for the same price as
      before. Their resulting revenues will then likewise be the same. The use of AI
      will save the employers 50 percent of their former total wage bills (less the
      cost of implementing AI) and those savings will be kept by employers as added
      profit for them. That added profit was an effective incentive for the employer
      to implement AI.


      If we imagine for a moment that the employees had the power that capitalism confers
      exclusively on employers, they would choose to use AI in an altogether different
      way. They would use AI, fire no one, but instead cut all employees’ working days
      by 50 percent while keeping their wages the same. Once again keeping our example
      simple, this would result in the same output as before the use of AI, and the
      same price for the goods or services and revenue inflow would follow. The profit
      margin would remain the same after the use of AI as before (minus the cost of
      implementing the technology). The 50 percent of employees’ previous workdays that
      are now available for their leisure would be the benefit they accrue. That leisure—freedom
      from work—is their incentive to use AI differently from how employers did.


      One way of using AI yields added profits for a few, while the other way yields
      added leisure/freedom to many. Capitalism rewards and thus encourages the employers’
      way. Democracy points the other way. The technology itself is ambivalent. It can
      be used either way.


      Thus, it is simply false to write or say—as so many do these days—that AI threatens
      millions of jobs or jobholders. Technology is not doing that. Rather the capitalist
      system organizes enterprises into employers versus employees and thereby uses
      technological progress to increase profit, not employees’ free time.


      Throughout history, enthusiasts celebrated most major technological advances because
      of their “labor-saving” qualities. Introducing new technologies would deliver
      less work, less drudgery, and less demeaning labor. The implication was that “we”—all
      people—would benefit. Of course, capitalists’ added profits from technical advances
      no doubt brought them more leisure. However, the added leisure new technologies
      made possible for the employee majority was mostly denied to them. Capitalism—the
      profit-driven system—caused that denial.


      Today, we face the same old capitalist story. The use of AI can ensure much more
      leisure for the working class, but capitalism instead subordinates AI to profiteering.
      Politicians shed crocodile tears over the scary vista of jobs lost to AI. Pundits
      exchange estimates of how many millions of jobs will be lost if AI is adopted.
      Gullible liberals invent new government programs aimed to lessen or soften AI’s
      impact on employment. Once again, the unspoken agreement is not to question whether
      and how the problem is capitalism nor to pursue the possibility of system change
      as that problem’s solution.


      In an economy based on worker coops, employees would collectively be their own
      employers. Capitalism’s core structure of enterprises—the employer versus employee
      system—would no longer prevail. Implementing technology would then be a collective
      decision democratically arrived at. With the absence of capitalism’s employer
      versus employee division, the decision about when, where, and how to use AI, for
      example, would become the task and responsibility of the employees as a collective
      whole. They might consider the profitability of the enterprise among their goals
      for using AI, but they would certainly also consider the gain in leisure that
      this makes possible. Worker coops make decisions that differ from those of capitalist
      enterprises. Different economic systems affect and shape the societies in which
      they operate differently.


      Across capitalism’s history, employers and their ideologues learned how best to
      advocate for technological changes that could enhance profits. They celebrated
      those changes as breakthroughs in human ingenuity deserving everyone’s support.
      Individuals who suffered due to these technological advances were dismissed as,
      “the price to pay for social progress.” If those who suffered fought back, they
      were denounced for what was seen as anti-social behavior and were often criminalized.


      As with previous technological breakthroughs, AI places on society’s agenda both
      new issues and old contentious ones. AI’s importance is not limited to the productivity
      gains it achieves and the job losses it threatens. AI also challenges—yet again—the
      social decision to preserve the employer-employee division as the basic organization
      of enterprises. In capitalism’s past, only employers made the decisions whose
      results employees had to live with and accept. Maybe with AI, employees will demand
      to make those decisions via a system change beyond capitalism toward a worker-coop-based
      alternative.'
    one_sentence_summary: The article argues that while AI presents a profit opportunity
      for capitalists, it also poses a significant choice for the working class, highlighting
      the need for a shift from the traditional employer-employee dynamic to a worker
      cooperative model that prioritizes collective decision-making and leisure over
      profit maximization.
    paragraph_summary: The article discusses the implications of Artificial Intelligence
      (AI) within the context of capitalism, highlighting the profit opportunities for
      employers versus the choices facing the working class. It argues that while AI
      can significantly increase productivity, it often leads to job losses as employers
      prioritize profits over employee welfare. The author contrasts the capitalist
      approach—where employers decide on technology implementation solely based on profit—with
      a potential worker cooperative model, where employees collectively make decisions
      about technology use, potentially prioritizing leisure and well-being over profit.
      The article critiques the capitalist system for perpetuating job insecurity and
      calls for a reevaluation of how technological advancements are integrated into
      society, suggesting that a shift towards worker cooperatives could empower employees
      and reshape the benefits of technological progress.

  - title: 'Economic Growth in G7 Versus BRICS: A Reality Check'
    url: https://www.counterpunch.org/2023/09/08/economic-growth-in-g7-versus-brics-a-reality-check/
    text: 'In the United Kingdom, the BBC prepared and published data from the International
      Monetary Fund (IMF) in January about different nations’ growth forecasts for 2023
      and 2024. The BBC foregrounded some really bad news for the UK. Of nine major
      industrial economies—the G7 (the U.S., Canada, Japan, Germany, the UK, France,
      and Canada), plus Russia, and China—the UK would be the only one to suffer real
      economic decline: a contraction in its 2023 GDP (its total annual, national output
      of goods and services). So dubious a distinction for the UK followed the long
      political night of rule by the Conservative Party. That night’s darker moments
      included austerity after the severe 2008-2009 global capitalist crash, scapegoating
      Europe for the UK’s economic troubles, Brexit taking place during the peak of
      that scapegoating, enjoyment of COVID cocktail parties by former Prime Minister
      Boris Johnson’s government that it prohibited for the British public, and endless,
      transparent, and cringeworthy lying to the public when caught and exposed. But
      the BBC’s report on the new IMF data was shocking about far more than the poor
      performance of the UK economy.


      For the rest of 2023, the IMF says China’s GDP will grow more than 5 percent or
      more than twice Japan’s GDP growth rate. All other G7 countries will grow their
      GDPs more slowly than Japan. China’s growth rate will be more than triple that
      of the U.S. in 2023. Finally, the IMF’s projected GDP growth for 2024 shows both
      Russia and China growing much faster than any G7 country. These comparative forecasts
      comprise a reality check that clashes with most politicians’ statements, mass
      media accounts, and propaganda barrages (worsened by the Ukraine war) emerging
      from the G7’s old capitalist establishment. The BBC report was thus both rare
      and arresting.


      For 30 years, skepticism and disparagements confronted China’s claims about its
      economic growth. When these attempts to debunk Beijing’s claims were subsequently
      proven wrong by the country’s stunning record of superior economic growth, the
      intensity of these efforts nonetheless mounted. Disbelief in China’s economic
      achievements grew even as in-person visits to China confirmed high rates of industrialization,
      internal migration and urbanization, and fast-rising mass consumption levels.
      The need to disregard China’s economic transition from extreme poverty to economic
      superpower status rivaling the U.S. reminds us of the Cold War-driven nonrecognition
      of Soviet economic achievements after 1945. A parallel nonrecognition figures
      again in the G7 sanctions strategy against Russia over the Ukraine war. For anyone
      seriously interested in understanding the momentous changes now sweeping across
      the world economy, one question looms. How do we account for the gap between what
      the old capitalist establishment says (and may even believe) and what is real?


      The answer is that we are confronted with a combination of denials and pretenses
      that are caused by the conjoined decline of U.S. capitalism and its global empire
      (or hegemony). Those declines have occasionally become clear enough, at least
      fleetingly, to observers within the old capitalist establishment. For example,
      such key moments include the U.S. military’s inability to “win” local wars even
      against poor countries such as Afghanistan and Iraq. Another example was the U.S.
      medical-industrial complex’s subpar performance in managing the high number of
      COVID deaths and illnesses. U.S. capitalism’s crash in 2020 and into 2021 was
      severe and then was followed immediately by a bad inflation and then a fast, destabilizing
      tightening of credit: not exactly a stellar economic record. Debt levels of the
      U.S. government, corporations, and households are at or near record levels. Inequalities
      of wealth and income, already extreme, keep rising. A public viewing such facts
      might reasonably wonder whether something bigger is at play beyond these events
      being seen in isolation. Might there possibly be a systemic problem?


      But before such a line of thought can jell into a conscious question, let alone
      any serious pursuit of an answer, denial sets in. A systemic breakdown seems an
      unbearable thought, so denial of systematicity is undertaken. Statements about
      specifics are carefully crafted to omit connecting them to their context of a
      declining capitalist system. Evasion of the systemic dimension leads to undervaluing
      the dangers each particular problem or crisis presents. Like rose-colored glasses,
      anti-systemic glasses make economic problems appear less dangerous, narrower,
      and more limited in effects than they actually are. The anti-systemic bias is
      a form of denial.


      Consider, for example, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen or other officials when
      they bemoan deepening U.S. economic inequality. They do not refute nor even seem
      able to imagine that within a declining capitalism, the richest and most powerful
      will use their positions to shift the costs of its decline onto others. For example,
      raising interest rates these days to counter inflation—instead of imposing wage-price
      freezes like former President Richard M. Nixon did in 1971 or imposing a goods
      rationing system as former President Franklin D. Roosevelt did in the 1940s—is
      an anti-inflation policy choice. The burden of this option falls more heavily
      on middle- and lower-income recipients than on the rich. Similar cost-shifting
      is entailed by a policy of huge federal budget deficits because they are financed
      by borrowing disproportionally from (and thus paying more interest to) the richest
      parts of society. Yet mainstream G7 discussions of those policy choices and deficits
      rarely link them to the decline of U.S. capitalism and its global hegemony.


      Complementing denial of systemic problems in G7 economies are loud pretenses about
      their good health in contrast to problems elsewhere. Like the repeated affirmations
      about a “great” U.S. economy contrasted with deep difficulties afflicting the
      Russian and Chinese economies. Ironically, those difficulties are regularly rendered
      as systemic, flowing from the “natures” of an “authoritarian” or socialist economic
      system. For example, in recent years, mainstream U.S. media reported that Russia’s
      ruble would soon “collapse,” that China’s building boom was collapsing, that China’s
      anti-COVID policies were wrecking its economy, and so on. Apropos Russia’s economy,
      the late U.S. Senator John McCain dismissed Russia as a “gas station masquerading
      as a country.” Around former President Donald Trump and President Joe Biden, the
      argument was often advanced that beyond all policy specifics (regarding tariffs,
      trade, sanctions, Hong Kong, and Taiwan), economic system change in China was
      necessarily a goal on the horizon.


      Reality undermines these denials and pretenses. That is one reason why they struggle
      so hard to obscure reality. For example, China’s economic performance, as measured
      by its world-leading GDP growth over the last quarter century, undergirds its
      confidence in and loyalty to its particular economic system. The BBC’s graphic
      only further confirms that confidence. By the same logic, that graphic challenges
      the systemic self-confidence of the old G7 capitalist establishment. Denials and
      pretenses are not likely to be sustainable responses to the widening differences
      between G7 performance and the emerging (and already larger in GDP terms) alternative
      gathered around the BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa).


      Of course, both G7 and BRICS are heterogeneous assemblages including many significant
      differences among their members. Nor is there any guarantee that either bloc will
      retain its capitalist or socialist components or make transitions between them.
      Relations between the G7 and BRICS, like any possible transitions among various
      forms of capitalism and socialism, are now crucial social issues and struggles.
      Social movements inside both blocs will shape those issues and those struggles.
      To do that, especially if wars are to be avoided, social movements will need to
      set aside denials and pretenses and face realities.

  - title: US Leaders Split on China Policy
    url: https://www.counterpunch.org/2023/08/04/us-leaders-split-on-china-policy/
    text: 'On the one hand, U.S. policy aims to constrain China’s economic, political,
      and military development because it has now become the United States’ chief economic
      competitor and thus enemy. On the other hand, U.S. policy seeks to secure the
      many benefits to the United States of its companies’ trade with and investments
      in China. U.S. debates over “decoupling” the two countries’ economies versus the
      milder version of the same thing—“de-risking”—exemplify, on both sides, U.S. policy’s
      split approach to China.


      The difficult reality for the United States is economic dependence on the world’s
      number two economy that deepens with China’s relentless march toward becoming
      the world’s number one. Likewise, China’s stunningly rapid growth over recent
      decades entangled it in a complex economic codependence with the U.S. market,
      the U.S. dollar, and U.S. interest rates. In stark contrast, neither the Soviet
      Union nor Russia ever offered the U.S. economic opportunities or competitive challenges
      comparable to what China now does. In this context, consider World Bank 2022 data
      on GDPs in Russia, Germany, China, and the United States: $1.5 trillion, $3.9
      trillion, $14.7 trillion, and $20.9 trillion, respectively.


      The political right wings of both major U.S. political parties and the military-industrial
      complex have long prevailed in shaping how U.S. mainstream media treat the country’s
      foreign policies. Over the last decade especially, the media has increasingly
      accused China of aggressively expanding its global influence, of authoritarianism
      at home, and of policies targeting the United States. Over recent decades, big
      business interests promote a quite different U.S. foreign policy prioritizing
      profitable coexistence between the United States and China. U.S. policy splits
      and oscillates between these two poles. One day Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase
      bank and U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen go to Beijing to support mutuality
      of interests while at the same time, President Biden labels Xi Jinping a “dictator.”


      The history and legacy of the Cold War accustomed U.S. media, politicians, and
      academics to traffic in hyperbolic denunciations of communism plus parties and
      governments they link to it. Right-wing political forces have always been eager
      to update anti-Soviet, Cold War logics and slogans for use against China’s government
      and Communist Party as continuing villains. Old (Taiwan and Hong Kong) and new
      issues (Uyghurs) mark an ongoing campaign.


      Yet as the Cold War wound down and then collapsed with the USSR’s demise, Nixon
      and Kissinger reconnected with a China already launched on an economic development
      surge that never stopped. Capitalists from the system’s old centers in the G7
      (Western Europe, North America, and Japan) poured investments into China to profit
      from its relatively much lower wages and its rapidly growing internal market.
      Over the last 50 years, consumer goods and capital goods flowed out of factories
      in China to markets around the world. China became deeply entangled in global
      supply chains. Exports from China brought an inflow of payments in U.S. dollars.
      China lent many of those dollars back to the U.S. Treasury to fund its growing
      budget deficits. China joined Japan as the two major creditor countries of the
      United States, the world’s greatest debtor country.


      China’s investment of its accumulating dollars in U.S. Treasury bonds helped to
      enable the fast-rising U.S. national debt over the last half-century. That helped
      keep U.S. interest rates low to fuel U.S. economic growth and its recoveries from
      several economic crashes. China’s relatively low-priced exports reflected its
      low wages and active government development supports. Those exports to the United
      States helped prevent inflation over most of those years. In turn, low prices
      reduced pressures from employees for higher wages and thereby supported U.S. capitalists’
      profits. In these and still other ways, U.S.-China connections became deeply embedded
      in the functioning and success of U.S. capitalism. Cutting those connections would
      risk very adverse economic consequences for the United States.


      Moreover, many proposals favoring such cutting are ineffective and ill-informed
      fantasies. If the U.S. government could force United States and other multinational
      corporations to close up shop in China, they would most likely move to other low-wage
      Asian locations. They would not return to the United States because its wages
      and other expenses are too high and thus non-competitive. Where they do go will
      entail sourcing inputs from China, already their most competitive producer. In
      short, forcing capitalists to leave China will help the United States minimally
      and hurt the Chinese minimally as well. Closing off the China market for U.S.
      microchip-makers is likewise a faulty fantasy. Without access to the booming Chinese
      market, U.S.-based companies will be uncompetitive with other chip-makers based
      in countries not closed out of the Chinese market.


      U.S. capitalism needs the inflow of most Chinese exports and needs inclusion in
      China’s markets. U.S. megabanks need access to China’s fast-growing markets or
      else European, Japanese, and Chinese banks will eventually outcompete the U.S.
      banks. Even if the United States could force or maneuver G7 banks to join a U.S.-led
      exit from China, China’s banks and those of its allies in India, Russia, Brazil,
      and South Africa (the BRICS) would control access to the profitable financing
      of China’s growth. In terms of aggregate GDPs, the BRICS are already a bigger
      economic system, taken together, than the G7 taken together, and the gap between
      them keeps widening.


      Were the United States to pursue its resumed Cold War crusade against China—economically,
      politically, and/or militarily without nuclear warfare—the results could risk
      major dislocations, losses, and costly adjustments for U.S. capitalism. With nuclear
      warfare, of course, the risks are still larger. Other than extreme parts of the
      U.S. right wing, no one wants to take such risks. The United States’ G7 allies
      surely do not. Already they are imagining their desired futures in a bipolar world
      split between falling and rising hegemons and perhaps counterhegemonic groupings
      of other nations. Most of the world recognizes China’s relentless growth and expansion
      as the major dynamic of today’s world economy. Most likewise see the United States
      as the major antagonist tilting against China’s rise into a global superpower
      position.


      What many observers of the China-U.S. clash miss are those of its causes and shapers
      located in the extreme tensions and contradictions besetting the employer-employee
      class conflicts within both superpowers. Those class conflicts in the United States
      respond to this basic question: whose wealth, income, and social position will
      have to bear the major burden of accommodating the costs of declining hegemony?
      Will the redistribution of wealth upward across the last 3-40 years persist, be
      stopped, or be reversed? Are rising labor militancy across the United States and
      the quasi-fascistic resurging U.S. right wing foretastes of struggles to come?


      China’s remarkable ascension rapidly transformed a rural, poor, agricultural economy
      into an urban, middle-income, and industrial economy. The parallel transformation
      in Western Europe took centuries and occasioned profound, bitter, and violent
      class struggles. In China, the transformation took a few decades and was likely
      the more profoundly traumatic for that reason. Will similar class struggles erupt
      there? Are they building beneath the surface of Chinese society already? Might
      the Global South be where global capitalism—the system defined by its employer-versus-employee
      productive core—goes finally to play the endgame of its profit-maximization fetish?


      Both the United States and China display economic systems organized around workplace
      organizations where a small number of employers dominate a large number of hired
      employees. In the United States, those workplace organizations are mostly private
      enterprises. China displays a hybrid system whose enterprises are both private
      and state-owned and operated, but where both types of workplace organizations
      share the employer-versus-employee organization. That organization typically features
      the employer class accumulating far more wealth than the employee class. Moreover,
      that wealthy class of employers can and usually does buy dominant political power
      as well. The resulting mix of economic and political inequality provokes tensions,
      conflicts, and social change.


      That reality is already well established in both the United States and China.
      Thus, for example, the United States has not raised its federal minimum wage of
      $7.25 per hour since 2009. Both major political parties are responsible. Yellen
      gives speeches bemoaning the deepening inequalities in the United States, but
      the deepening persists. In the tradition of blaming the victim, American capitalism
      tends to fault the poor for their poverty. Xi Jinping also worries openly about
      deepening inequalities: likely more urgent in nations calling themselves socialist.
      Even though China has taken significant steps to reduce its recently extreme economic
      inequalities, they remain a serious social problem there too. The U.S.-China clash
      depends as much on each nation’s internal class conflicts and struggles as it
      depends on their policies toward one another.


      China adjusts to the twists and turns in the United States’ split policy approach.
      It prepares for both eventualities: cutthroat competition abetted by intense economic
      nationalism possibly including military warfare or a conjointly planned peaceful
      economic coexistence. As China awaits the United States’ decisions on which way
      to guide the United States’ economic future, China’s growth will likely continue,
      matching and then surpassing the United States’ global economic footprint. China’s
      stunning economic growth success across the last 30 years secures China’s remarkable
      hybrid economy of private and state enterprises supervised by and subordinated
      to a powerful political party. An anxious world awaits the next chapter in capitalism’s
      always dangerously uneven mix of class and national struggles.

    paragraph_summary: The article discusses the complex and contradictory nature of
      U.S. policy towards China, which simultaneously seeks to constrain China's rise
      as a global economic and military competitor while also benefiting from trade
      and investment opportunities with the country. The U.S. faces a challenging economic
      dependence on China, which has rapidly grown into the world's second-largest economy,
      creating a deep codependence that was not present during the Cold War with the
      Soviet Union. The political landscape in the U.S. is divided, with some advocating
      for a confrontational approach towards China, while others, including major business
      interests, push for a more cooperative relationship. The article highlights the
      historical context of U.S.-China relations, the significant economic ties that
      have developed, and the internal class struggles within both nations that shape
      their interactions. It suggests that the future of U.S.-China relations will depend
      on how these internal conflicts evolve, as well as the broader geopolitical dynamics,
      with China likely to continue its economic ascent regardless of U.S. policy direction.

  - title: Why Capitalism is Leaving the US in Search of Profit
    url: https://www.counterpunch.org/2023/07/21/why-capitalism-is-leaving-the-us-in-search-of-profit/
    text: 'Early U.S. capitalism was centered in New England. After some time, the pursuit
      of profit led many capitalists to leave that area and move production to New York
      and the mid-Atlantic states. Much of New England was left with abandoned factory
      buildings and depressed towns evident to this day. Eventually employers moved
      again, abandoning New York and the mid-Atlantic for the Midwest. The same story
      kept repeating as capitalism’s center relocated to the Far West, the South, and
      the Southwest. Descriptive terms like “Rust Belt,” “deindustrialization,” and
      “manufacturing desert” increasingly applied to ever more portions of U.S. capitalism.


      So long as capitalism’s movements stayed mostly within the U.S., the alarms raised
      by its abandoned victims remained regional, not becoming a national issue yet.
      Over recent decades, however, many capitalists have moved production facilities
      and investments outside the U.S., relocating them to other countries, especially
      to China. Ongoing controversies and alarms surround this capitalist exodus. Even
      the celebrated hi-tech sectors, arguably U.S. capitalism’s only remaining robust
      center, have invested heavily elsewhere.


      Since the 1970s, wages were far lower abroad and markets were growing faster there
      too. Ever more U.S. capitalists had to leave or risk losing their competitive
      edge over those capitalists (European and Japanese, as well as U.S.) who had left
      earlier for China and were showing stunningly improved profit rates. Beyond China,
      other Asian, South American, and African countries also provided incentives of
      low wages and growing markets, which eventually drew U.S. capitalists and others
      to move investments there.


      Profits from those capitalists’ movements stimulated more movements. Rising profits
      flowed back to rally U.S. stock markets and produced great gains in income and
      wealth. That chiefly benefited the already rich corporate shareholders and top
      corporate executives. They in turn promoted and funded ideological claims that
      capitalism’s abandonment of the U.S. was actually a great gain for U.S. society
      as a whole. Those claims, categorized under the headings of “neoliberalism” and
      “globalization” served neatly to hide or obscure one key fact: higher profits
      mainly for the richest few was the chief goal and the result of capitalists abandoning
      the U.S.


      Neoliberalism was a new version of an old economic theory that justified capitalists’
      “free choices” as the necessary means to achieve optimal efficiency for entire
      economies. According to the neoliberal view, governments should minimize any regulation
      or other interference in capitalists’ profit-driven decisions. Neoliberalism celebrated
      “globalization,” its preferred name for capitalists’ choosing to specifically
      move production overseas. That “free choice” was said to enable “more efficient”
      production of goods and services because capitalists could tap globally sourced
      resources. The point and punchline flowing from exaltations of neoliberalism,
      capitalists’ free choices, and globalization were that all citizens benefited
      when capitalism moved on. Excepting a few dissenters (including some unions),
      politicians, mass media, and academicians largely joined the intense cheerleading
      for capitalism’s neoliberal globalization.


      The economic consequences of capitalism’s profit-driven movement out of its old
      centers (Western Europe, North America, and Japan) brought capitalism there to
      its current crisis. First, real wages stagnated in the old centers. Employers
      who could export jobs (especially in manufacturing) did so. Employers who could
      not (especially in service sectors) automated them. As U.S. job opportunities
      stopped rising, so did wages. Since globalization and automation boosted corporate
      profits and stock markets while wages stagnated, capitalism’s old centers exhibited
      extreme widening of income and wealth gaps. Deepening social divisions followed
      and culminated in capitalism’s crisis now.


      Second, unlike many other poor countries, China possessed the ideology and organization
      to make sure that investments made by capitalists served China’s own development
      plan and economic strategy. China required the sharing of incoming capitalists’
      advanced technologies (in exchange for those capitalists’ access to low-wage Chinese
      labor and rapidly expanding Chinese markets). The capitalists entering the Beijing
      markets were also required to facilitate partnerships between Chinese producers
      and distribution channels in their home countries. China’s strategy to prioritize
      exports meant that it needed to secure access to distribution systems (and thus
      distribution networks controlled by capitalists) in its targeted markets. Mutually
      profitable partnerships developed between China and global distributors such as
      Walmart.


      Beijing’s “socialism with Chinese characteristics” included a powerful development-focused
      political party and state. Conjointly they supervised and controlled an economy
      that mixed private with state capitalism. In that model private employers and
      state employers each direct masses of employees in their respective enterprises.
      Both sets of employers function subject to the strategic interventions of a party
      and government determined to achieve its economic goals. As a result of how it
      defined and operated its socialism, China’s economy gained more (especially in
      GDP growth) from neoliberal globalization than Western Europe, North America,
      and Japan did. China grew fast enough to compete now with capitalism’s old centers.
      The decline of the U.S. within a changing world economy has contributed to the
      crisis of U.S. capitalism. For the U.S. empire that arose out of World War II,
      China and its BRICS allies represent its first serious, sustained economic challenge.
      The official U.S. reaction to these changes so far has been a mix of resentment,
      provocation, and denial. Those are neither solutions to the crisis nor successful
      adjustments to a changed reality.


      Third, the Ukraine war has exposed key effects of capitalism’s geographic movements
      and the accelerated economic decline of the U.S. relative to the economic rise
      of China. Thus the U.S.-led sanctions war against Russia has failed to crush the
      ruble or collapse the Russian economy. That failure has followed in good part
      because Russia obtained crucial support from the alliances (BRICS) already built
      around China. Those alliances, enriched by both foreign and domestic capitalists’
      investments, especially in China and India, provided alternative markets when
      sanctions closed off Western markets to Russian exports.


      Earlier income and wealth gaps in the U.S., worsened by the export and automation
      of high-paying jobs, undermined the economic basis of that “vast middle class”
      that so many employees believed themselves to be part of. Over recent decades,
      workers who expected to enjoy “the American dream” found that increased costs
      of goods and services led to the dream being beyond their reach. Their children,
      especially those forced to borrow for college, found themselves in a similar situation
      or in a worse one. Resistances of all sorts arose (unionization drives, strikes,
      left and right “populisms”) as working-class living conditions kept deteriorating.
      Making matters worse, mass media celebrated the stupefying wealth of those few
      who profited most from neoliberal globalization. In the U.S., phenomena like former
      President Donald Trump, Vermont’s independent Senator Bernie Sanders, white supremacy,
      unionization, strikes, explicit anti-capitalism, “culture” wars, and frequently
      bizarre political extremism reflect deepening social divisions. Many in the U.S.
      feel betrayed after being abandoned by capitalism. Their differing explanations
      for the betrayal exacerbate the widely held sense of crisis in the nation.


      Capitalism’s global relocation helped raise the total GDP of the BRICS nations
      (China + allies) well above that of the G7 (U.S. + allies). For all the countries
      of the Global South, their appeals for development assistance can now be directed
      to two possible respondents (China and the U.S.), not just the one in the West.
      When Chinese entities invest in Africa, of course their investments are structured
      to help both donors and recipients. Whether the relationship between them is imperialist
      or not depends on the specifics of the relationship, and its balance of net gains.
      Those gains for the BRICS will likely be substantial. Russia’s adjustment to Ukraine-related
      sanctions against it not only led it to lean more on BRICS but likewise intensified
      the economic interactions among BRICS members. Existing economic links and conjoint
      projects among them grew. New ones are fast emerging. Unsurprisingly, additional
      countries in the Global South have recently requested BRICS membership.


      Capitalism has moved on, abandoning its old centers and thereby pushing its problems
      and divisions to crisis levels. Because profits still flow back to the old centers,
      those there gathering the profits delude their countries and themselves into thinking
      all is well in and for global capitalism. Because those profits sharply aggravate
      economic inequalities, social crises there deepen. For example, the wave of labor
      militancy sweeping across nearly all U.S. industries reflects anger and resentment
      against those inequalities. The hysterical scapegoating of various minorities
      by right-wing demagogues and movements is another reflection of the worsening
      difficulties. Yet another is the growing realization that the problem, at its
      root, is the capitalist system. All of these are components of today’s crisis.


      Even in capitalism’s new dynamic centers, a critical socialist question returns
      to agitate people’s minds. Is the new centers’ organization of workplaces—retaining
      the old capitalist model of employers vs. employees in both private and state
      enterprises—desirable or sustainable? Is it acceptable for a small group, employers,
      exclusively and unaccountably to make most key workplace decisions (what, where,
      and how to produce and what to do with the profits)? That is clearly undemocratic.
      Employees in capitalism’s new centers already question the system; some have begun
      to challenge and move against it. Where those new centers celebrate some variety
      of socialism, employees will more likely (and sooner) resist subordination to
      the residues of capitalism in their workplaces.'
    one_sentence_summary: The article discusses the historical shifts of U.S. capitalism
      from New England to various regions and ultimately abroad, highlighting how these
      relocations have led to economic decline, rising inequality, and social crises
      in the U.S., while simultaneously benefiting capitalists and creating new economic
      dynamics in countries like China and among BRICS nations.
    paragraph_summary: The article discusses the historical evolution of U.S. capitalism,
      which initially thrived in New England before shifting production to New York,
      the mid-Atlantic, and eventually the Midwest and beyond, leading to the decline
      of these regions into "Rust Belt" areas marked by deindustrialization. As capitalists
      increasingly relocated production overseas, particularly to China, they sought
      lower wages and faster-growing markets, resulting in significant profits that
      primarily benefited the wealthy elite while exacerbating income inequality and
      social divisions in the U.S. The rise of neoliberalism and globalization justified
      these movements as beneficial for society, despite the reality of stagnating wages
      and job opportunities for the working class. The article also highlights the growing
      economic challenge posed by China and its BRICS allies, which have gained from
      globalization while the U.S. faces a crisis of capitalism characterized by deepening
      social unrest and a questioning of the capitalist model itself. As labor movements
      gain momentum in response to these inequalities, the article raises critical questions
      about the sustainability and desirability of the current capitalist organization
      of workplaces.

  - title: It’s Hard for Americans to Engage in China-Bashing Without Tripping on Contradictions
    url: https://www.counterpunch.org/2023/07/10/its-hard-for-americans-to-engage-in-china-bashing-without-tripping-on-contradictions/
    text: 'The contradictions of China-bashing in the United States begin with how often
      it is flat-out untrue. The Wall Street Journal reports that the “Chinese spy”
      balloon that President Joe Biden shot down with immense patriotic fanfare in February
      2023 did not in fact transmit pictures or anything else to China. White House
      economists have been trying to excuse persistent U.S. inflation saying it is a
      global problem and inflation is worse elsewhere in the world. China’s inflation
      rate is 0.7 percent year-on-year. Financial media outlets stress how China’s GDP
      growth rate is lower than it used to be. China now estimates that its 2023 GDP
      growth will be 5 to 5.5 percent. Estimates for the U.S. GDP growth rate in 2023,
      meanwhile, vacillate around 1 to 2 percent.


      China-bashing has intensified into denial and self-delusion—it is akin to pretending
      that the United States did not lose wars in Vietnam, Afghanistan, Iraq, and more.
      The BRICS coalition (China and its allies) now has a significantly larger global
      economic footprint (higher total GDP) than the G7 (the United States and its allies).
      China is outgrowing the rest of the world in research and development expenditures.
      The American empire (like its foundation, American capitalism) is not the dominating
      global force it once was right after World War II. The empire and the economy
      have shrunk in size, power, and influence considerably since then. And they continue
      to do so. Putting that genie back into the bottle is a battle against history
      that the United States is not likely to win.


      Denial and self-delusion about the changing world economy have led to major strategic
      mistakes. United States leaders predicted before and shortly after February 2022—when
      the Ukraine war began—for example, that Russia’s economy would crash from the
      effects of the “greatest of all sanctions,” led by the United States. Some U.S.
      leaders still believe that the crash will take place (publicly, if not privately)
      despite there being no such indication. Such predictions badly miscalculated the
      economic strength and potential of Russia’s allies in the BRICS. Led by China
      and India, the BRICS nations responded to Russia’s need for buyers of its oil
      and gas. The United States made its European allies cut off purchasing Russian
      oil and gas as part of the sanctions war against the Kremlin over Ukraine. However,
      U.S. pressure tactics used on China, India, and many other nations (inside and
      outside BRICS) to likewise stop buying Russian exports failed. They not only purchased
      oil and gas from Russia but then also reexported some of it to European nations.
      World power configurations had followed the changes in the world economy at the
      expense of the U.S. position.


      War games with allies, threats from U.S. officials, and U.S. warships off China’s
      coast may delude some to imagine that these moves intimidate China. The reality
      is that the military disparity between China and the United States is smaller
      now than it has ever been in modern China’s history. China’s military alliances
      are the strongest they have ever been. Intimidation that did not work from the
      time of the Korean War and since then, will certainly not be effective now. Former
      President Donald Trump’s tariff and trade wars were aimed, U.S. officials said,
      to persuade China to change its “authoritarian” economic system. If so, that aim
      was not achieved. The United States simply lacks the power to force the matter.


      American polls suggest that media outlets have been successful in a) portraying
      China’s advances economically and technologically as a threat, and b) using that
      threat to lobby against regulations of U.S. high-tech industries. Of course, business
      opposition to government regulation predates China’s emergence. However, encouraging
      hostility toward China provides convenient additional cover for all sorts of business
      interests. China’s technological challenge flows from and depends upon a massive
      educational effort based on training far more STEM scientists than the United
      States does. Yet, U.S. business does not support paying taxes to fund education
      equivalently. The reporting by the media on this issue rarely covers that obvious
      contradiction and politicians mostly avoid it as dangerous to their electoral
      prospects.


      Scapegoating China joins with scapegoating immigrants, BIPOCs, and many of the
      other usual targets. The broader decline of the U.S. empire and capitalist economic
      system confronts the nation with the stark question: whose standard of living
      will bear the burden of the impact of this decline? The answer to that question
      has been crystal clear: the government will pursue austerity policies (cut vital
      public services) and will allow price inflation and then rising interest rates
      that reduce living standards and jobs.


      Coming on top of 2020’s combined economic crash and pandemic, the middle- and-lower-income
      majority have so far borne most of the cost of the United States’s decline. That
      has been the pattern followed by declining empires throughout human history: those
      who control wealth and power are best positioned to offload the costs of decline
      onto the general population.


      The real sufferings of that population cause vulnerability to the political agendas
      of demagogues. They offer scapegoats to offset popular upset, bitterness, and
      anger. Leading capitalists and the politicians they own welcome or tolerate scapegoating
      as a distraction from those leaders’ responsibilities for mass suffering. Demagogic
      leaders scapegoat old and new targets: immigrants, BIPOCs, women, socialists,
      liberals, minorities of various kinds, and foreign threats. The scapegoating usually
      does little more than hurt its intended victims. Its failure to solve any real
      problem keeps that problem alive and available for demagogues to exploit at a
      later stage (at least until scapegoating’s victims resist enough to end it).


      The contradictions of scapegoating include the dangerous risk that it overflows
      its original purposes and causes capitalism more problems than it relieves. If
      anti-immigrant agitation actually slows or stops immigration (as has happened
      recently in the United States), domestic labor shortages may appear or worsen,
      which may drive up wages, and thereby hurt profits. If racism similarly leads
      to disruptive civil disturbances (as has happened recently in France), profits
      may be depressed. If China-bashing leads the United States and Beijing to move
      further against U.S. businesses investing in and trading with China, that could
      prove very costly to the U.S. economy. That this may happen now is a dangerous
      consequence of China-bashing.


      Because they believed it would be in the U.S. interest, then-President Richard
      Nixon resumed diplomatic and other relations with Beijing during his 1972 trip
      to the country. Former Chinese Chairman Mao Zedong, former Premier Zhou Enlai,
      and Nixon started a period of economic growth, trade, investment, and prosperity
      for both China and the United States. The success of that period prompted China
      to seek to continue it. That same success prompted the United States in recent
      years to change its attitude and policies. More accurately, that success prompted
      U.S. political leaders like Trump and Biden to now perceive China as the enemy
      whose economic development represents a threat. They demonize the Beijing leadership
      accordingly.


      The majority of U.S. megacorporations disagrees. They profited mightily from their
      access to the Chinese labor force and the rapidly growing Chinese market since
      the 1980s. That was a large part of what they meant when they celebrated “neoliberal
      globalization.” A significant part of the U.S. business community, however, wants
      continued access to China.


      The fight inside the United States now pits major parts of the U.S. business community
      against Biden and his equally “neoconservative” foreign policy advisers. The outcome
      of that fight depends on domestic economic conditions, the presidential election
      campaign, and the political fallout of the Ukraine war as well the ongoing twists
      and turns of the China-U.S. relations. The outcome also depends on how the masses
      of Chinese and U.S. people understand and intervene in relations between these
      two countries. Will they see through the contradictions of China-bashing to prevent
      war, seek mutual accommodation, and thereby rebuild a new version of the joint
      prosperity that existed before Trump and Biden?

    one_sentence_summary: The article critiques the U.S. tendency to scapegoat China
      for domestic issues and economic decline, highlighting the contradictions in this
      narrative, such as the reality of China's economic growth and the failure of U.S.

    paragraph_summary: The article critiques the trend of "China-bashing" in the United
      States, highlighting the inaccuracies and contradictions in the portrayal of China
      as a threat. It points out that claims about Chinese espionage, economic competition,
      and military intimidation often lack factual basis, as evidenced by China's low
      inflation rate and projected GDP growth outpacing that of the U.S. The author
      argues that the U.S. is in denial about its declining global influence and that
      scapegoating China serves as a distraction from domestic issues, such as rising
      living costs and economic inequality. This scapegoating, alongside the political
      agendas of demagogues, risks exacerbating the challenges faced by the American
      populace and could harm U.S. economic interests in China. The article suggests
      that a reevaluation of U.S.-China relations is necessary, advocating for mutual
      understanding and cooperation to restore the prosperity seen in past decades.

    text: 'The year 2020 marked parity between the total GDP of the G7 (the U.S. plus
      allies) and the total GDP of the BRICS group (China plus allies). Since then,
      the BRICS economies grew faster than the G7 economies. Now a third of total world
      output comes from the BRICS countries while the G7 accounts for below 30 percent.
      Beyond the obvious symbolism, this difference entails real political, cultural,
      and economic consequences. Bringing Ukraine’s Zelenskyy to Hiroshima to address
      the G7 recently failed to distract the G7’s attention from the huge global issue:
      what is growing in the world economy vs. what is declining.


      The evident failure of the economic sanctions war against Russia offers yet more
      evidence of the relative strength of the BRICS alliance. That alliance now can
      and does offer nations alternatives to accommodating the demands and pressures
      of the once-hegemonic G7. The latter’s efforts to isolate Russia seem to have
      boomeranged and exposed instead the relative isolation of the G7. Even France’s
      Macron wondered out loud whether France might be betting on the wrong horse in
      that G7 vs. BRICS economic race just under the surface of the Ukraine war. Perhaps
      earlier, less-developed precursors of that race influenced failed U.S. land wars
      in Asia from Korea through Vietnam to Afghanistan and Iraq.


      China increasingly competes openly with the United States and its international
      lending allies (the IMF and the World Bank) in development loans to the Global
      South. The G7 attack the Chinese, charging them with replicating the predatory
      lending for which G7 colonialism was and G7 neocolonialism is justly infamous.
      The attacks have had little effect given the needs for such borrowing that drive
      the welcome offered to China’s loan policies. Time will tell whether shifting
      economic collaboration from the G7 to China leaves centuries of predatory lending
      behind. Meanwhile, the political and cultural changes accompanying China’s global
      economic activities are already evident: for example, African nations’ neutrality
      toward the Ukraine-Russia war despite G7 pressures.


      De-dollarization represents yet another dimension of the now rapid realignments
      in the world economy. Since 2000, the proportion of central banks’ currency reserves
      held in U.S. dollars has fallen by half. That decline continues. Every week brings
      news of countries cutting trade and investment payments in U.S. dollars in favor
      of payments in their own currencies or other currencies than the U.S. dollar.
      Saudi Arabia is closing down the petrodollar system that crucially supported the
      U.S. dollar as the pre-eminent global currency. Reduced global reliance on the
      U.S. dollar also reduces dollars available for loans to the U.S. government to
      finance its borrowings. The long-term effects of that, especially as the U.S.
      government runs immense budget deficits, will likely be significant.


      China recently brokered the rapprochement between enemies Iran and Saudi Arabia.
      Pretending that such peace-making is insignificant represents purely wishful thinking.
      China can and will likely continue to make peace for two key reasons. First, it
      has resources (loans, trade deals, investments) to commit to sweeten accommodations
      between adversaries. Second, China’s stunning growth over the last three decades
      was accomplished under and by means of a global regime mostly at peace. Wars then
      were mostly confined to specific, very poor Asian locations. Those wars minimally
      disrupted the world trade and capital flows that enriched China.


      Neoliberal globalization benefited China disproportionally. So China and BRICS
      countries have replaced the United States as the champion of continuing a broadly
      defined global free trade and capital movements regime. Defusing conflicts, especially
      in the contentious Middle East, enables China to promote the peaceful world economy
      in which it prospered. In contrast, the economic nationalism (trade wars, tariff
      policies, targeted sanctions, etc.) pursued by Trump and Biden has struck China
      as a threat and a danger. In reaction, China has been able to mobilize many other
      nations to resist and oppose United States and G7 policies in various global forums.


      The source of China’s remarkable economic growth—and the key to BRICS countries’
      now successful challenge to the G7’s global economic dominance—has been its hybrid
      economic model. China broke from the Soviet model by not organizing industry as
      primarily state-owned-and-operated enterprises. It broke from the U.S. model by
      not organizing industries as privately owned and operated enterprises. Instead,
      it organized a hybrid combining both state and private enterprises under the political
      supervision and ultimate control of the Chinese Communist Party. This hybrid macroeconomic
      structure enabled China’s economic growth to outperform both the USSR and the
      United States. Both China’s private and state enterprises organize their workplaces—their
      production systems’ micro-level—into the employer-employee structures exemplified
      by both Soviet public and U.S. private enterprises. China did not break from those
      microeconomic structures.


      If we define capitalism precisely as that particular microeconomic structure (employer-employee,
      wage labor, etc.), we can differentiate it from the master-slave or lord-serf
      microeconomic structures of slave and feudal workplaces. Following that definition,
      what China constructed is a hybrid state-plus-private capitalism run by a communist
      party. It is a rather original and particular class structure designated by the
      nation’s self-description as “socialism with Chinese characteristics.” That class
      structure proved its superiority to both the USSR and the G7 in terms of its achieved
      rates of economic growth and independent technological development. China has
      become the first systemic and global competitor that the United States has had
      to face in the last century.


      Lenin once referred to the early USSR as a “state capitalism” challenged by the
      task of making a further transition to post-capitalist socialism. Xi Jinping could
      refer to China today as a hybrid state-plus-private capitalism similarly challenged
      by the task of navigating its way forward to a genuinely post-capitalist socialism.
      That would involve and require a transition from the employer-employee workplace
      structure to the democratic alternative microeconomic structure: a workplace cooperative
      community or a workers’ self-directed enterprise. The USSR never made that transition.
      Two key questions follow for China: Can it? And will it?


      The United States also faces two key questions. First, how much longer will most
      U.S. leaders persist in denying its economic and global declines, acting as if
      the U.S. position had not changed since the 1970s and 1980s? Second, how can such
      leaders’ behavior be explained when large American majorities acknowledge those
      declines as ongoing long-term trends? A Pew Research Center random poll taken
      among Americans between March 27 and April 2, 2023, asked what they expected the
      situation of the United States to be in 2050 compared with today. Some 66 percent
      expect the U.S. economy will be weaker. Seventy-one percent expect the United
      States will be less important in the world. Seventy-seven percent expect the United
      States will be more politically divided. Eighty-one percent expect the gap between
      rich and poor will grow. The people clearly sense what their leaders desperately
      deny. That difference haunts U.S. politics.

      nations, which have surpassed the G7 in GDP share and are challenging U.S. dominance
      through alternative lending practices and geopolitical influence, while highlighting
      the implications of de-dollarization and the need for both China and the U.S.

    paragraph_summary: The article discusses the shifting dynamics of global economic
      power, highlighting that as of 2020, the combined GDP of the BRICS nations (Brazil,
      Russia, India, China, and South Africa) surpassed that of the G7 (U.S. and its
      allies), with BRICS economies growing at a faster rate since then. This shift
      has significant political, cultural, and economic implications, particularly as
      the G7 struggles to isolate Russia amid its war with Ukraine, revealing its own
      relative isolation. China, in particular, is emerging as a competitor to the U.S.
      in global lending, especially in the Global South, while the trend of de-dollarization
      is reducing reliance on the U.S. dollar in international trade. China's unique
      hybrid economic model, which combines state and private enterprises, has contributed
      to its rapid growth and positioned it as a formidable challenger to U.S. dominance.
      The article raises questions about the future trajectories of both China and the
      U.S., particularly regarding their economic models and the potential for political
      and social transformations.

  - title: Market Fundamentalism is an Obstacle to Social Progress
    url: https://www.counterpunch.org/2023/05/22/market-fundamentalism-is-an-obstacle-to-social-progress/
    text: 'A changing world order, a shrinking U.S. empire, migrations and related demographic
      shifts, and major economic crashes have all enhanced religious fundamentalisms
      around the world. Beyond religions, other ideological fundamentalisms likewise
      provide widely welcomed reassurances. One of the latter—market fundamentalism—invites
      and deserves criticism as a major obstacle to navigating this time of rapid social
      change. Market fundamentalism attributes to that particular social institution
      a level of perfection and “optimality” quite parallel to what fundamentalist religions
      attribute to prophets and divinities.


      Yet markets are just one among many social means of rationing. Anything scarce
      relative to demand for it raises the same question: Who will get it and who must
      do without it? The market is one institutional way to ration the scarce item.
      In a market, those who want it bid up its price leading others to drop out because
      they cannot or will not pay the higher price. When higher prices have eliminated
      the excess of demand over supply, scarcity is gone, and no more bidding up is
      required. Those able and willing to pay the higher prices are satisfied by receiving
      distributions of the available supply.


      The market has thus rationed out the scarce supply. It has determined who gets
      and who does not. Clearly, the richer a buyer is, the more likely that buyer will
      welcome, endorse, and celebrate “the market system.” Markets favor rich buyers.
      Such buyers in turn will more likely support teachers, clerics, politicians, and
      others who promote arguments that markets are “efficient,” “socially positive,”
      or “best for everyone.”


      Yet even the economics profession—which routinely celebrates markets—includes
      a sizable—if underemphasized—literature about how, why, and when free (i.e., unregulated)
      markets do not work efficiently or in socially positive ways. That literature
      has developed concepts like “imperfect competition,” “market distortions,” and
      “externalities,” to pinpoint markets failing to be efficient or benefit social
      welfare. Social leaders who have had to deal with actual markets in society have
      likewise repeatedly intervened in them when and because markets worked in socially
      unacceptable ways. Thus, we have minimum wage laws, maximum interest-rate laws,
      price-gouging laws, and tariff and trade wars. Practical people know that “leaving
      matters to the market” has often yielded disasters (e.g., the crashes of 2000,
      2008, and 2020) overcome by massive, sustained governmental regulation of and
      intervention in markets.


      So then why do market fundamentalists celebrate a rationing system—the market—that
      in both theory and practice is more replete with holes than a block of Swiss cheese?
      Libertarians go so far as to promote a “pure” market economy as a realizable utopia.
      Such a pure market system is their policy to fix the massive problems they admit
      exist in contemporary (impure) capitalism. Libertarians are forever frustrated
      by their lack of success.


      For many reasons, markets ought not claim anyone’s loyalty. Among alternative
      systems of rationing scarcity, markets are clearly inferior. For example, in many
      religious, ethical, and moral traditions, basic precepts urge or insist that scarcity
      be addressed by a rationing system based on their respective concepts of human
      need. Many other rationing systems—including the U.S. version used in World War
      II—dispensed with the market system and substituted a needs-based rationing system
      managed by the government.


      Rationing systems could likewise be based on age, type of work performed, employment
      status, family situation, health conditions, distance between home and workplace,
      or other criteria. Their importance relative to one another and relative to some
      composite notion of “need,” could and should be determined democratically. Indeed,
      a genuinely democratic society would let the people decide which (if any) scarcities
      should be rationed by the market and which (if any) by alternative rationing systems.


      Market fetishists will surely trot out their favorite rationalizations with which
      to regale students. For example, they argue that when buyers bid up prices for
      scarce items other entrepreneurs will rush in with more supply to capture those
      higher prices, thereby ending the scarcity. This simple-minded argument fails
      to grasp that the entrepreneurs cashing in on the higher prices for scarce items
      have every incentive and many of the means to prevent, delay, or block altogether
      the entry of new suppliers. Actual business history shows that they often do so
      successfully. In other words, glib assurances about reactions to market prices
      are ideological noise and little else.


      We can also catch the market fetishizers in their own contradictions. When justifying
      the sky-high pay packages of mega-corporate CEOs, we are told their scarcity requires
      their high prices. The same folks explain to us that to overcome scarcity of wage
      labor, it was necessary to cut U.S. workers’ pandemic-era unemployment supplement,
      not to raise their wages. During times of scarcity, markets often reveal to capitalists
      the possibility of earning higher profits on lower volumes of product and sales.
      If they prioritize profits and when they can afford to bar others’ entry, they
      will produce and sell less at higher prices to a richer clientele. We are watching
      that process unfold in the United States now.


      The neoliberal turn in U.S. capitalism since the 1970s yielded big profits from
      a globalized market system. However, outside the purview of neoliberal ideology,
      that global market catapulted the Chinese economy forward far faster than the
      United States and far faster than the United States found acceptable. Thus the
      United States junked its market celebrations (substituting intense “security”
      concerns) to justify massive governmental interventions in markets to thwart Chinese
      development: a trade war, tariff wars, chip subsidies, and sanctions. Awkwardly
      and unpersuasively, the economic profession keeps teaching about the efficiency
      of free or pure markets, while students learn from the news all about U.S. protectionism,
      market management, and the need to turn away from the free market gods previously
      venerated.


      Then too the market-based health care system of the United States challenges market
      fundamentalism: the United States has 4.3 percent of the world population but
      accounted for 16.9 percent of the world’s COVID-19 deaths. Might the market system
      bear a significant share of the blame and fault here? So dangerous is the potential
      disruption of ideological consensus that it becomes vital to avoid asking the
      question, let alone pursuing a serious answer.


      During the pandemic, millions of workers were told that they were “essential”
      and “front-line responders.” A grateful society appreciated them. As they often
      noted, the market had not rewarded them accordingly. They got very low wages.
      They must not have been scarce enough to command better. That’s how markets work.
      Markets do not reward what is most valuable and essential. They never did. They
      reward what is scarce relative to people’s ability to buy, no matter the social
      importance we give to the actual work and roles people play. Markets pander to
      where the money is. No wonder the rich subsidize market fundamentalism. The wonder
      is why the rest of society believes or tolerates it.

      that prioritizes profit and efficiency over social welfare, arguing that it serves
      as a major barrier to effectively addressing the challenges posed by a rapidly

  - title: The Debt Ceiling Debate is a Massive Deception of the American Public
    url: https://www.counterpunch.org/2023/05/10/the-debt-ceiling-debate-is-a-massive-deception-of-the-american-public/
    text: 'Future historians will likely look back at the debt ceiling rituals being
      reenacted these days with a frustrated shaking of their heads. That otherwise
      reasonable people would be so readily deceived raises the question that will provoke
      those historians: How could this happen?


      The U.S. Congress has imposed successive ceilings on the national debt, each one
      higher than the last. Ceilings were intended to limit the amount of federal borrowing.
      But the same U.S. Congress so managed its taxing and spending that it created
      ever more excesses of spending over tax revenues (deficits). Those excesses required
      borrowing to cover them. The borrowings accumulated to hit successive ceilings.
      A highly political ritual of threats and counterthreats accompanied each rise
      of the ceiling required by the need to borrow to finance deficits.


      It is elementary economics to note that if Congress raised more taxes or cut federal
      spending—or both—there would be no need to borrow and thus no ceiling on borrowing
      to worry about. The ceiling would become irrelevant or merely symbolic. Further,
      if taxes were raised enough and spending cut enough, the existing U.S. national
      debt could be reduced. That situation has happened occasionally in U.S. history.


      The real issue then is that when borrowing approaches any ceiling, the policy
      choices are these three: raise the ceiling (to borrow more), raise taxes, or cut
      spending. Of course, combinations of them would also be possible.


      In contrast to this reality, U.S. politics deceives by constricting its debate.
      Politicians, the mainstream media, and academics simply omit—basically by refusing
      to admit or consider—tax increases. The GOP demands spending cuts or else it will
      block raising the ceiling. The Democrats insist that raising the ceiling is the
      better choice than cutting spending. Democrats threaten to blame the GOP for the
      consequences of not raising the debt ceiling. They paint those consequences in
      lurid colors depicting U.S. bondholders denied interest or repayment, Social Security
      recipients denied their pensions, and government employees denied their wages.
      The unspoken agreement between the two major parties is to omit any serious discussion
      of raising taxes to avoid hitting the debt ceiling. That omission entails deception.


      Here are some tax increases that could help solve the problem by avoiding any
      need to raise the debt ceiling. The social security tax could be applied to all
      wage and salary incomes, not only those of $160,000 or less as is now the case.
      The social security tax could be applied to nonwage income such as interest dividends,
      capital gains, and rents. The corporate profits tax could be raised back to what
      it was a few decades ago: near or above 50 percent versus the current 37 percent
      rate. A property tax could be levied on property that takes the form of stocks
      and bonds. The current property tax in the United States (levied mostly at the
      local level) includes land, houses, automobiles, and business inventories, while
      it excludes stocks and bonds. Perhaps that is because the richest 10 percent of
      Americans own roughly 80 percent of stocks and bonds. The current property tax
      system in the United States is very nice for that 10 percent. Another logical
      candidate is the federal estate tax which a few years ago exempted under $1 million
      of an estate from the tax, but now exempts over $12 million per person (over $25
      million per couple). That exemption makes a mockery of the idea that all Americans
      start or live their lives on a level playing field where merit counts more than
      inheritance. The U.S. could and should go back from that tax giveaway to the richest.
      There are many more possible tax increases.


      Of course, there are strengths and weaknesses entailed in raising every tax, positive
      and negative consequences. But the exact same is true of raising the debt ceiling
      and thereby increasing the U.S. national debt. Likewise cutting spending has its
      pluses and minuses in terms of pain and gain. There is no logical or reasonable
      basis for excluding tax increases from the national debate and discussion about
      raising the debt ceiling and thereby the national debt.


      It is rather the shared political commitments of both major parties that require
      and motivate the exclusion. There is no reason for U.S. citizens to accept, tolerate,
      endorse, or otherwise validate the debt ceiling deception perpetrated against
      us.


      Nor is the debt ceiling deception alone. The previous national debate over responding
      to inflation by having the Federal Reserve raise interest rates provides another
      quite parallel example. That debate proceeded by debating the pros and cons of
      interest rate increases as if no other anti-inflationary policy existed or was
      even worth mentioning. Once again elementary economics teaches that wage-price
      freezes and rationing have been used against inflations in the past—including
      in the United States—as alternatives to raising interest rates or alongside them.
      U.S. President Nixon in 1971 used wage-price freezes. U.S. President Roosevelt
      used rationing during World War II. But the government, Federal Reserve, major
      media, and major academic leaders carried on their recent policy debates as if
      those other anti-inflationary tools did not exist or were not worth including
      in the debate.


      Wage-price freezes and rationing have their strengths and weaknesses—just as tax
      increases do—but once again the same applies to raising interest rates. No justification
      exists for proceeding as if alternative options are not there. The U.S. national
      debate over fighting inflation was deceptive in the same way that the debate over
      the debt ceiling is.


      Nor is the deception any less if it is covered by a claim of “realism.” Those
      who grasp elementary economics enough to know that tax increases could “solve”
      the debt ceiling issue become complicit in the deception by invoking “realism.”
      Since the two major parties are jointly subservient to corporations and the rich,
      they rule out tax increases on them. It thus becomes “realistic” to exclude that
      option from the debt ceiling debate. What is best for corporations and the rich
      thus gets equated to what is “realistic.” It is worth remembering that throughout
      history ruling classes have discovered, to their shock and surprise, that the
      ruled can and often do quickly alter what is “realistic.”


      The debt ceiling deceptions favor corporations over individuals and the richest
      individuals over the rest of us. In our thinking and speaking too, the nation’s
      class structure and class struggles exhibit their influential power. The mainstream
      debt ceiling debate deceives by lying by omission rather than commission.

      and the wealthy over those of ordinary citizens.
    paragraph_summary: The article critiques the ongoing U.S. debt ceiling debates,
      suggesting that they represent a political deception where the possibility of
      tax increases is systematically excluded from discussions about managing national
      debt. It argues that Congress has repeatedly raised the debt ceiling to accommodate
      increasing deficits caused by a mismatch between spending and tax revenues, while
      politicians and media focus on threats and counterthreats rather than addressing
      the root causes of the debt. The author proposes various tax reforms, such as
      extending Social Security taxes to all income levels and raising corporate tax
      rates, as viable solutions to avoid hitting the debt ceiling. The piece contends
      that both major political parties collude to omit tax increases from the conversation,
      favoring corporate interests over the needs of the general populace, and calls
      for a more honest and inclusive debate on fiscal policy that considers all options,
      including tax increases, rather than perpetuating a cycle of borrowing and debt.

  - title: The Emerging New World Economy
    url: https://www.counterpunch.org/2023/04/17/the-emerging-new-world-economy/
    text: 'The emerging new always both frightens and inspires the fading old. History
      is that unity of opposites. Sharp-edged rejections of what is new clash with enthusiastic
      celebrations of it. The old gets pushed away even as bitter denials of that reality
      surge. The emerging new world economy displays just such contradictions. Four
      major developments can illustrate them and underscore their interactions.


      First, the neoliberal globalizing paradigm is now the old. Economic nationalism
      is the new. It is another reversal of their previous positions. Driven by its
      celebrated profit motive, capitalism in its old centers (western Europe, North
      America, and Japan) invested increasingly elsewhere: where labor power was far
      cheaper; markets were growing faster; ecological constraints were weak or absent;
      and governments better facilitated rapid accumulation of capital. Those investments
      brought big profits back into capitalism’s old centers, whose stock markets boomed
      and thus their income and wealth inequalities widened (since the richest Americans
      own the great bulk of securities). Even faster was the economic growth unleashed
      after the 1960s in what quickly became capitalism’s new centers (China, India,
      and Brazil). That growth was further enhanced by the arrival of the capital relocated
      from the old centers. Capitalism’s dynamic had earlier moved its production center
      from England to the European continent, then on to North America and Japan. That
      same profit-driven dynamic took it to mainland Asia and beyond during the end
      of the 20th and beginning of the 21st centuries.


      Neoliberal globalization in theory and practice both reflected and justified this
      relocation of capitalism. It celebrated the profits and growth brought to both
      private and state-owned/operated enterprises around the world. It downplayed or
      ignored the other sides of globalization: (1) growing income and wealth inequalities
      inside most countries; (2) the shift of production from old to new centers of
      capitalism; and (3) faster growth of output and markets in new centers than old
      centers. These changes shook the old centers’ societies. Middle classes there
      atrophied and shrank as good jobs moved increasingly to capitalism’s new centers.
      The old centers’ employer classes used their power and wealth to maintain their
      social positions. Indeed, they got richer by harvesting the greater profits rolling
      in from the new centers.


      However, neoliberal globalization proved disastrous for most employees in capitalism’s
      old centers. In the latter, the employer class not only grabbed rising profits,
      but also offloaded the costs of the decline of capitalism’s old centers onto employees.
      Tax cuts for business and the wealthy, stagnant or declining real wages (abetted
      by immigration), “austerity” reductions of public services, and neglect of infrastructure
      produced widening inequality. Working classes across the capitalist West were
      shocked out of the delusion that neoliberal globalization was the best policy
      for them too. Rising labor militancy across the U.S., like mass uprisings in France
      and Greece and left political shifts across the Global South, entail rejections
      of neoliberal globalization and its political and ideological leaders. Beyond
      that, capitalism itself is being shaken, questioned, and challenged. In new ways,
      projects for going beyond capitalism are again on the historical agenda despite
      the status quo’s efforts to pretend otherwise.


      Second, over recent decades, the intensifying problems of neoliberal globalization
      forced capitalism to make adjustments. As neoliberal globalization lost mass support
      in capitalism’s old centers, governments took on powers and made more economic
      interventions to sustain the capitalist system. In short, economic nationalism
      rose to replace neoliberalism. Instead of the old laissez-faire ideology and policies,
      nationalist capitalism rationalized the state’s expanding power. In capitalism’s
      new centers, enhanced state power produced economic development that markedly
      outgrew the old centers. The new centers’ recipe was to create a system in which
      a large sector of private enterprises (owned and operated by private individuals)
      coexisted with a large sector of state enterprises owned by the state and operated
      by its officials. Instead of a mostly private capitalist system (like that of
      the U.S. or UK) or a mostly state capitalist system (like that of the USSR), places
      like China and India produced hybrids. Strong national governments presided over
      coexisting large private and state sectors to maximize economic growth.


      Both private and state enterprises and their coexistence deserve the label “capitalist.”
      That is because both organize around the relationship of employers and employees.
      In both private and state enterprises/systems, a small employer minority dominates
      and controls a large employee majority. After all, slavery also often displayed
      coexisting private and state enterprises that shared the defining master-slave
      relationship. Likewise, feudalism had private and state enterprises with the same
      lord-serf relationship. Capitalism does not disappear when it displays coexisting
      private and state enterprises organized around the same employer-employee relationship.
      Thus we do not conflate state capitalism with socialism. In the latter, a different,
      noncapitalist economic system displaces the employer-employee organization of
      workplaces in favor of a democratic workplace community organization as in worker
      cooperatives. The transition to socialism in that sense is also a possible outcome
      of the turmoil today surrounding the formation of a new world economy.


      The state-private hybrid in China achieves remarkably high and enduring GDP and
      real-wage growth rates that have continued now over the last 30 years. That success
      deeply influences economic nationalisms everywhere to move toward that hybrid
      as a model. Even in the U.S., competition with China becomes the go-to excuse
      for massive governmental interventions. Tariff wars—that raised domestic taxes—could
      be enthusiastically endorsed by politicians who otherwise preached laissez-faire
      ideology. The same applied to government-run trade wars, government targeting
      of specific corporations for punishment or bans, government subsidies to whole
      industries as so many anti-China economic ploys.


      Third, over recent decades, the U.S. empire peaked and began its decline. It thus
      follows every other empire’s (Greek, Roman, Persian, and British) classic pattern
      of birth, evolution, decline, and death. The U.S. empire emerged from and replaced
      the British Empire over the last century and especially after World War II. Earlier,
      in 1776 and again in 1812, the British Empire tried and failed militarily to prevent
      or stop an independent U.S. capitalism from developing. After those failures,
      Britain took a different path in its relations with the U.S. After many more wars
      in its colonies and with competing colonialisms across the 19th and 20th centuries,
      Britain’s empire is now gone.


      The question is whether the U.S. has learned or even can learn the key lesson
      of Britain’s imperial decline. Or will it keep trying military means, ever more
      desperately and dangerously, to hold on to a global hegemonic position that relentlessly
      declines? After all, the U.S. wars in Korea, Vietnam, Afghanistan, and Iraq were
      all lost. China has now replaced the U.S. as the major peacemaker in the Middle
      East. The days of the U.S. dollar as the supreme global currency are numbered.
      U.S. supremacy in high-tech industries must already be shared with China’s high-tech
      industries. Even major U.S. corporate CEOs such as Apple’s Tim Cook and the U.S.
      Chamber of Commerce want the profits of more trade and investment flows between
      the U.S. and China. They look with dismay at the Biden administration’s rising
      politically driven hostilities directed at China.


      Fourth, the U.S. empire’s decline raises the question of what comes next as the
      decline deepens. Is China the emerging new hegemon? Will it inherit the empire
      mantle from the U.S. as the U.S. took it from Britain? Or will some multinational
      new world order emerge and shape a new world economy? The most interesting possibility
      and perhaps the likeliest is that China and the entire BRICS (Brazil, Russia,
      India, China, and South Africa) grouping of nations will undertake the construction
      and maintenance of a new world economy. The war in Ukraine has already enhanced
      the prospects of such an outcome by strengthening the BRICS alliance. Many other
      countries have applied or will soon apply for entry into the BRICS framework.
      Together, they have the population, resources, productive capacity, connections,
      and accumulated solidarity to be a new pole for world economic development. Were
      they to play that role, the remaining parts of the world from Australia and New
      Zealand to Africa, Europe, and South America would have to rethink their foreign
      economic and political policies. Their economic futures depend in part on how
      they navigate the contest between old and new world economic organizations. Those
      futures likewise depend on how critics and victims of both neoliberal/globalizing
      capitalism and nationalist capitalism interact inside all nations.

      by capitalism's old centers as they grapple with rising inequalities, the decline
      of U.S. imperial power, and the emergence of new economic models led by countries

    paragraph_summary: The article explores the tensions between the fading neoliberal
      globalizing paradigm and the rise of economic nationalism, highlighting the contradictions
      within the evolving world economy. It argues that while neoliberal globalization
      initially facilitated capital relocation from old economic centers (like the U.S.
      and Europe) to emerging markets (such as China and India), it ultimately led to
      increased inequality and discontent among the working classes in the old centers.
      As support for neoliberalism wanes, governments are increasingly intervening in
      the economy, adopting nationalist policies that blend private and state enterprises,
      particularly in new centers of capitalism. The decline of U.S. hegemony is also
      discussed, questioning whether China will emerge as the new global leader or if
      a new multinational order will take shape, particularly through the BRICS nations.
      The article emphasizes that the future of global economic dynamics will depend
      on how nations navigate these shifts and the interactions between critics of both
      neoliberal and nationalist capitalism.

  - title: The Economic Realities We Face at the End of 2022
    url: https://www.counterpunch.org/2022/12/19/the-economic-realities-we-face-at-the-end-of-2022/
    text: 'Economies around the world were shocked and damaged over the course of 2022.
      Global capitalism had been brewing conflicts among the major powers (the United
      States, China, and the EU) for some time as their relative strengths and vulnerabilities
      shifted. U.S. capitalism and its empire are widely perceived as waning. Europe’s
      role as a U.S. ally and indeed its economic future became correspondingly riskier
      as a result. China’s economic growth encountered problems but continued to be
      remarkably positive and often crucially supportive of world economic conditions
      in ways that were once more closely associated with the role of the United States.
      China’s deepening alliance with Russia as well as its burgeoning global economic
      reach frightened many in the United States. Years of increasingly aggressive competition,
      tariff and trade wars, and bans and subsidies, mostly initiated by the United
      States, culminated this past year in global economic warfare.


      The key fact is not the military war between Russia and Ukraine, so far a limited,
      secondary affair except for the massive on-the-ground suffering of the Ukrainian
      people and the soldiers on both sides of the conflict. The year’s key reality
      is rather the economic warfare between the United States and the EU versus Russia
      and China: sanctions and countersanctions. Their ramifications (energy price spikes,
      supply chain disruptions, and massive market shifts) worsened the inflation already
      troubling many countries. These, in turn, provoked central bank interest rate
      increases that added more disruptive and costly shocks to an already problematic
      2022 global economy.


      For decades, wealth and income have been redistributed upward—with minimal protest
      by the working classes who were harmed by that redistribution. During 2022, working
      classes in many countries were no longer willing to defer their needs in the wake
      of that redistribution. Labor militancy, unionization, and strikes have all been
      renewed with remarkable energy and enthusiasm. Increasing numbers of workers are
      unwilling to wait and see whether or not long sluggish center-left and center-right
      governments and parties would do anything adequate to change the deepening inequalities,
      instabilities, and injustices of contemporary capitalism.


      Capitalism’s victims increasingly rediscovered and resumed alliances with its
      critics. Thus, they know that stagflation, not recovery, may well be the result
      of inflation plus interest rate hikes. The emergence of the Global South as an
      important player in great power politics and its current realignments took further
      steps during 2022. Widespread feelings that an old capitalist world is falling
      apart are not fading.


      Those feelings emerge into public view during a period of massive contradictions—for
      example, the resurgence of both white supremacy and anti-fascism, or the blows
      against abortion access in the U.S. following the Supreme Court’s decision to
      overturn Roe v. Wade in contrast with France’s enshrining of abortion access in
      its constitution. Chinese workers demand better wages and working conditions while
      the dishonesty of global capitalist polluters gets increasingly exposed.


      Meanwhile, global changes in great power alignments risk being misunderstood or
      undervalued because clashing capitalisms disguise themselves, yet again, in great
      principles. Russia versus Ukraine gets rewritten as anti-Russian North Atlantic
      Treaty Organization (NATO) expansion versus Ukrainian self-determination. U.S.
      capitalism’s shift from neoliberal globalization to government-led economic nationalism
      to counter China’s rise in the global economy gets rewritten as required by “national
      security.” The further fracturing of Europe’s unity gets rewritten, in truly upside-down
      fashion, as a rebuilt U.S.-EU-NATO alliance. Proliferating delusions need deciphering.


      Global capitalism has already stumbled badly three times in this new century:
      the dot-com crisis in 2000, the subprime mortgage crisis in 2008, and the COVID-19
      crisis in 2020. Calling each crisis by a different, conjunctural name thinly disguises
      a cyclic instability intrinsic to and as old as capitalism. The capitalist system
      that dominates globally today organizes 99 percent of its workplaces/enterprises
      with a small minority of employers who direct the large majority of employees.
      It forces today’s great powers (the United States, the EU, and China) to mobilize
      their allies and compete to shape the decisions of the Global South. The post-World
      War II years of U.S. hegemony governed and held together a particular global arrangement
      of economies. The culmination of short-term instabilities and long-term trends
      inside and outside the great powers has undermined U.S. hegemony. A struggle to
      shape the emerging “new world order” is underway. That struggle is the economic
      reality as 2022 ends.


      The hegemonic war of maneuver is our context now; it will last until or unless
      a new global arrangement arrives. The French think tank École de Guerre Économique
      (EGE) has for 25 years been studying the shadow wars for dominance over the global
      economy with interesting, provocative results. In October 2022, EGE released a
      book, Guerre Économique: Qui Est l’Ennemi? (Economic War: Who Is the Enemy?),
      which presented the findings of a survey of French business experts that was conducted
      by EGE’s Centre de Recherche 451 (CR451) in July 2022. Respondents were asked
      to name five foreign powers that most threaten France’s interests. They answered
      that the United States was France’s greatest threat, with China, Germany, Russia,
      and the UK following, in descending order.


      It would be wishful thinking to mistake this result as peculiar to the French.
      Many leaders and influencers around the world criticize and resent the last 75
      years of economic hegemony wielded by the United States. That perspective on current
      events has only strengthened in recent years as the U.S. global empire has lost
      power, the United States lost wars in Asia, and China emerged as the first serious
      economic competitor against the United States since at least 1945. The Ukraine
      war has so far served mainly to validate and thus harden that perspective.


      The U.S.-China conflict has provoked ongoing changes and shifts among all players
      in the global economy. After more than two decades of doing poorly in competition
      with China, the United States has shifted from a policy of neoliberal globalization
      to one of economic nationalism. The presidencies of Barack Obama, Donald Trump,
      and now Joe Biden illustrate the shift (even as orthodox economics finds it awkward
      having celebrated laissez-faire for so long). Objections from European, Canadian,
      and other corners flood into Washington against new U.S. subsidies for automobiles
      produced inside the United States. Those self-serving U.S. policies are said to
      threaten deindustrialization elsewhere. Europe’s traditional subordination to
      and alliance with the United States since 1945 is fraying, notwithstanding the
      loud claims to the contrary coming from the United States and the EU. The deep
      economic and political decline of the UK before and especially after Brexit has
      the United States considering reliable, alternative agents for its European interests.
      Germany is the likeliest candidate if it could play that role without jeopardizing
      its dependence on exports to China. Maneuvers inside Europe force the UK and each
      EU member to strategize how best to respond to them as well as to the United States
      and China. Oil and gas price inflation resulting from the U.S.-EU sanctions against
      Russia intensified all these conflicts because they disadvantage Europe relatively
      more compared to the other players in the world economy and also European nations
      vis-à-vis one another.


      Secondary themes distract many from grasping the global reorganization now underway.
      Among these are principles like “national self-determination,” “freedom of the
      seas,” and “rules-based international order.” They serve mostly to hide the global
      reorganization as if, suddenly, such principles were the dominant reality requiring
      protection. The principles, rather, provide convenient veneers for another period
      of great power realignments like those witnessed in capitalism before.


      Before 1914, contesting capitalisms fought over their respective colonial possessions
      amid those capitalisms’ shifting relative strengths. A declining British empire
      struggled with the major aspiring contestants to replace that empire (the United
      States and Germany) and the minor aspirants (France, Russia, and Japan). Caught
      up in their global power struggles were a disintegrating China and a Global South
      that was prioritizing decolonization above all else. Within each nation, class
      struggles—especially a rising socialism challenging capitalism—further complicated
      their external power maneuvers. Those conflicts culminated in World War I. That
      war also changed everything: the global power configuration and, likewise, the
      internal class struggles.


      The U.S. empire replaced the British empire. The USSR replaced Russia. Germany’s
      empire was erased. Japan tried to build an Asian empire and splinter China. Anti-imperialism
      gained strength everywhere. But so did the capitalist economic system—the structure
      of production that positions a tiny minority of owners/directors—the employers—over
      a vast majority of workers—the employees. True, the USSR led global movements
      against capitalism, but they mostly focused on displacing private employers with
      state officials as employers. For most in that generation, capitalism meant private
      employers, whereas socialism meant state employers. Capitalism’s basic workplace
      structure—employers versus employees—persisted in both its state and private forms.
      Capitalism’s two forms contested and worked their profound influences everywhere,
      culminating in World War II.


      Britain, Germany, Japan, and Russia were all deeply damaged and weakened, leaving
      the United States to expand and solidify its empire for the next 75 years. The
      USSR was strong enough to provide some counterweight to U.S. military power, chiefly
      by creating space for the emergence of replicas of its socialism (state employers
      rather than private employers, in conjunction with state-planned distributions
      rather than free markets). China took advantage of that space but soon diverged
      into its own version of socialism, a hybrid of Soviet-style state enterprises
      and private capitalist enterprises, both with similar employer-employee structures.


      Now, yet again, capitalism’s contradictions are driving toward another war that
      would, likely, once again change everything. But now we can discern a certain
      pattern that would likely be repeated, more or less. An old empire (the United
      States) is now clearly in decline, and a new one (China) is emerging. The only
      other potential major power is the EU, but the disunity among its members greatly
      weakens its competitiveness relative to the United States and China. Secondary
      global powers are Japan and Russia, which are aligned with the United States and
      China, respectively. Lagging behind the major and secondary powers by varying
      degrees, there are other countries, including many in the Global South, that have
      become economically stronger but whose economic power remains relatively limited
      given their own divisions and divisiveness, as some play the major powers against
      one another (or try to).


      The collapse and disappearance of Eastern European socialism after 1989 and China’s
      major opening to both Chinese and foreign private capitalist investments in recent
      decades have combined to produce a broad crisis in socialism. European social
      democracy has steadily lost support across the continent. Neoliberalism had undermined
      social democracy ideologically even as economic realities provoked socially divisive
      immigration, automation, and job exports. Much the same had happened in the United
      States to the center-left represented by the Democratic Party, thereby paving
      the way for Trump. China’s rise has challenged the declining U.S. empire and provoked
      it to adopt increasingly desperate economic nationalism in response. BRICS (Brazil,
      Russia, India, China, and South Africa) and other related international blocs
      reflect and advance the rising strength and voice of many in the Global South
      who are moving toward alliances with China and Russia (accelerated by the Ukraine
      war and sanctions regime).


      Propaganda, trials, and errors characterize efforts by all sides to navigate a
      dangerous, tension-filled time of change. One side’s “freedom fighters” are characterized
      by the opposing side as agents of domination by major powers. One side’s expansion
      of its international trade and capital is branded “aggressiveness” by another
      side rattling its swords. Shifts from neoliberal globalization to assertive economic
      nationalism are all rationalized as requirements of “national security.” Decades
      earlier, devotees of neoliberalism celebrated its contributions to “peace” by
      merely existing as a passive contrast to economic nationalism and its characteristic
      propensity for wars. The less fantastic propaganda has its traces of truth, but
      they are faint. Repression of internal dissent occurs in all powers, more or less.
      Efforts by socialists and other working-class advocates are repressed or barely
      tolerated if carefully disconnected from global power politics.


      Socialists were split by World War I. On one side were those (Rosa Luxemburg,
      Eugene Debs, and Vladimir Lenin) who upheld the primacy of the anti-capitalist
      class struggle and transition to a post-capitalist economic and social system.
      On the other side were those who took sides in the global power struggles of capitalist
      powers and found convenient socialist-sounding rationales for doing so. World
      War I split socialists even as it strengthened a broadly defined socialism. World
      War II did the same. It not only hardened the splits within socialism (such as
      social democracy and Soviet socialism) but also extended the social reach of socialist
      variants of anti-capitalism, especially to the former colonies and China.


      Capitalism has been the context and ultimate cause of world history’s two worst
      wars. Many had thought, hoped, and worked so that those horrific wars might enable
      and empower first the League of Nations and later the United Nations. The goals
      of these organizations were to secure peace in place of global power politics
      moving toward war. They tried to achieve that goal without fundamentally challenging
      capitalism, the organization of an economy whose production entails a powerful
      minority (private or state) owning and operating enterprises. These organizations
      seem to have failed, but their failure left a lesson we can learn and build on.


      A truly internationalist socialism would not tolerate the inequalities within
      and among the nations of the world. Drastically reducing those would be the top
      priority. Providing full guarantees of food, clothing, and housing for all—across
      each individual’s lifetime—would be the second-highest priority. Democratizing
      not only political life (one person, one vote for all major community decisions)
      but also economic life (ensuring each employee has one vote on all major workplace
      decisions) would be the third key priority. A world committed to these goals—the
      concrete meaning of “going beyond capitalism” or “socialism”—could overcome causes
      of capitalist wars and hopefully also of wars in general.

    paragraph_summary: The article discusses the significant economic turmoil and geopolitical
      shifts that unfolded in 2022, highlighting the decline of U.S. capitalism and
      the rising influence of China, particularly in the context of its alliance with
      Russia amidst ongoing global economic warfare. It emphasizes the impact of sanctions
      and counter-sanctions between the U.S. and its allies against Russia and China,
      which exacerbated inflation and led to increased labor unrest as working classes
      worldwide began to demand better conditions in response to long-standing inequalities.
      The piece also explores the historical context of capitalism's cyclical crises
      and the emerging struggle for a new global order, noting the complexities of great
      power dynamics and the potential for renewed socialist movements that prioritize
      equality and democratic governance over the existing capitalist structures. Ultimately,
      it argues for a transformative vision of socialism that addresses the root causes
      of global conflict and inequality.
