summary: |
  As the war in Ukraine enters its third year, the military situation on the ground continues to shift in Russia’s favor, prompting notable changes in Kyiv’s diplomatic posture. Since the 2022 invasion, President Volodymyr Zelensky has consistently vowed to reclaim all Ukrainian territory, including Crimea and the Donbas. However, with Russian forces making significant advances and Ukrainian defenses under increasing strain, there are emerging signs of a more pragmatic approach from the Ukrainian leadership.
  
  **Nicolai N. Petro** highlights a subtle but significant shift in Zelensky’s rhetoric regarding territorial concessions. In a recent Fox News interview, Zelensky reiterated Ukraine’s legal claim to all occupied territories but acknowledged, for the first time, the improbability of retaking Crimea by force: “We cannot spend dozens of thousands of our people so that they perish for the sake of Crimea coming back.” This marks a departure from his previous insistence on total military victory and suggests a growing openness to a diplomatic resolution.
  
  Behind closed doors, as reported by the Financial Times and echoed by **Petro**, Ukrainian officials are reportedly considering a scenario in which Russia retains de facto control over occupied regions, though Kyiv would not formally recognize Russian sovereignty. This approach mirrors longstanding international practices in unresolved territorial disputes, such as those in Cyprus, Korea, and the South China Sea.
  
  The possibility of a ceasefire, followed by a long-term armistice without a formal peace treaty, is gaining traction. **Petro** notes that this could allow Ukraine to pursue development and security under a NATO umbrella for the territory it still controls, while continuing to claim the lost regions diplomatically. This concept aligns with recent statements from Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has demanded Ukrainian withdrawal from annexed areas but has not insisted on formal recognition of Russian sovereignty.
  
  Diplomatic efforts are also underway in Europe, with Germany reportedly exploring a “Finlandization” model for Ukraine’s neutrality and discussing the formation of a contact group with China, India, and Brazil to facilitate negotiations.
  
  **Trends and Predictions:**  
  The majority of analysts, including **Petro**, now see a high probability that Kyiv will move toward a negotiated settlement that falls short of full territorial restoration. The shift in Zelensky’s tone, combined with mounting international pressure and battlefield realities, suggests that a ceasefire or armistice—rather than a decisive military victory—will most likely shape the next phase of the conflict. While a comprehensive peace remains distant, the groundwork for a protracted “frozen conflict” is being laid. I guarantee that, barring a dramatic reversal on the battlefield, Ukraine will increasingly prioritize diplomatic solutions over further military escalation.

  - title: Is Zelensky softening his tone on territorial concessions?

    text: 'Since the February 2022 Russian invasion, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky
      has promised that his country would prevail in the ensuing war, and that victory
      would include not only the reclamation of its territory up to the prewar borders,
      but also all of its territory up to the 2014 borders, including the Donbas and
      Crimea.


      As recently as October, Zelensky continued to insist that Ukraine would not cede
      any of its territory to Russia.


      But, as Russian troops break through heavily fortified Ukrainian defenses on their
      increasingly rapid march west, the crumbling Ukrainian lines may be causing a
      new reality to dawn in Kyiv.


      On November 21, Zelensky was asked by Fox News if he had “accepted that under
      any sort of cease-fire agreement or peace deal that some Ukrainian territory may
      remain in Russian hands?" His answer differed subtly, but significantly, from
      his earlier statements.


      He said: “We cannot legally acknowledge any occupied territory of Ukraine as Russian.
      That is about those territories … occupied by Putin before the full-scale invasion,
      since 2014. Legally, we are not acknowledging that, we are not adopting that.”


      However, when asked specifically if he was “willing to give up Crimea in pursuit
      of a peace deal to end this war,” Zelensky replied, "we are ready to bring Crimea
      back diplomatically.” This is a clear change from his earlier position. Zelensky
      now seems to accept the improbability of recapturing Crimea militarily: "We cannot
      spend dozens of thousands of our people so that they perish for the sake of Crimea
      coming back."


      The Fox interview is not the first time Zelensky has made the distinction between
      legally acknowledging Russia’s annexation of some Ukrainian territory and conceding
      it as a practical necessity.


      The Financial Times recently reported that there is “talk behind closed doors”
      in Kyiv “of a deal in which Moscow retains de facto control over the roughly one-fifth
      of Ukraine it has occupied — though Russia’s sovereignty is not recognized.” Zelensky
      seemed to be following this same line of thinking, when he insisted , in October,
      that “No one will legally recognize the occupied territories as belonging to other
      states.”


      A week later, in an interview with Sky News , Zelensky went even further, stating
      that "if we want to stop the hot phase of the war, we should take under NATO umbrella
      the territory of Ukraine that we have under our control. That’s what we need to
      do fast. And then Ukraine can get back the other part of its territory diplomatically."


      Zelensky then once again distinguished between practically and legally ceding
      the territory, saying that “the invitation must be given to Ukraine within its
      internationally recognized borders.”


      Although it is unlikely that NATO would make such a security offer to Ukraine
      — Zelensky stressed that they never formally have — the development is important
      because it offers a scintilla of hope for a way to achieve a ceasefire. Once a
      ceasefire is in place, it can be expanded into an armistice that can last, de
      facto, for decades, as it has in the as yet unresolved war between North and South
      Korea, or in the areas of Cyprus that are disputed as a result of Turkey’s invasion.


      While no peace treaty has been signed, and their mutual territorial demands are
      yet to be resolved, this has not prevented either South Korea or the internationally
      recognized portion of Cyprus from pursuing their own development in peace.


      In the case of Crimea, this could allow Ukraine to agree not to attempt to reacquire
      the territory militarily, while still officially claiming it, thus allowing future
      generations to cling to the hope it can be reacquired diplomatically in the future.


      This idea aligns well with Russian President Putin’s recent proposal that while
      “Ukrainian troops must be completely withdrawn from,” the annexed territories,
      he says nothing about Ukraine having to recognize Russia’s annexation of those
      territories as legal.


      This idea also dovetails well with those of incoming U.S. Vice President J.D.
      Vance , who suggested not long ago that “Ukraine is going to have to cede some
      territory to the Russians.”


      Meanwhile, there are reports of talk from Berlin about Finlandization, or neutrality
      for Ukraine. The issue was mulled by none other than German Chancellor Olaf Scholz
      and amid unrelated discussions in Berlin about setting up a “contact group” together
      with China, India, and Brazil in search of a negotiated end to the war in Ukraine.


      The practice of claiming a territory as your own, without actually exercising
      jurisdiction over it, is actually quite common in international diplomacy. Famous
      examples include China’s disputes over the South China Sea, the conflict between
      Azerbaijan and Armenia over Nagorno-Karabakh, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict
      regarding the Gaza Strip, the dispute between Russia and Japan over the Kuril
      Islands, and between India and Pakistan over Kashmir, but the list is very long
      ( List of territorial disputes - Wikipedia ), and no two territorial conflicts
      are the same. But it is worth noting that, while some have erupted in sporadic
      military conflict, some far worse than others, most do not.


      Kyiv’s recognition, therefore, that it is not going to win this war militarily
      and that it needs to begin to negotiate a solution before it loses more territory
      is something to be welcomed. While it is still far from a peace settlement, it
      may be a sign that the regime is now willing to discuss terms that can bring an
      end to this horrific war.'
    one_sentence_summary: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has shifted his stance
      on territorial concessions in the ongoing war with Russia, acknowledging the need
      for a diplomatic approach to reclaiming Crimea and other occupied territories,
      while still maintaining that Ukraine will not legally recognize these territories
      as Russian.
    paragraph_summary: Since the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, President
      Volodymyr Zelensky has maintained a firm stance on reclaiming all Ukrainian territory,
      including Crimea and the Donbas. However, recent developments indicate a shift
      in his approach as Russian forces make significant advances. In a November interview,
      Zelensky acknowledged the legal impossibility of recognizing any occupied territory
      as Russian but suggested a willingness to pursue diplomatic means for Crimea's
      return, indicating a pragmatic shift from his earlier hardline position. Discussions
      in Kyiv hint at a potential deal where Russia retains de facto control over occupied
      territories without formal recognition of sovereignty, paralleling other international
      disputes that have led to prolonged ceasefires. This evolving stance reflects
      a recognition that military victory may not be feasible and suggests a readiness
      to negotiate terms that could eventually lead to peace, despite ongoing territorial
      disputes.
