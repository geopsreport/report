summary: |
  The ongoing geopolitical landscape remains shaped by persistent tensions between Russia and the West, the evolving dynamics of the Israel-Iran conflict, and questions over NATO’s credibility and strategic direction. Recent analysis continues to highlight the disconnect between public narratives and underlying realities, with skepticism mounting over Western policy coherence and military effectiveness.
  
  A key theme in the latest commentary is the enduring nature of Western hostility towards Russia. **Patrick Armstrong** notes that anti-Russian sentiment, particularly in Britain, has deep historical roots, with contemporary narratives echoing those of the Crimean War era. He points out that “the West's narrative remains largely unchanged, suggesting a persistent bias that may indeed validate Russian claims of enduring Western hostility.” This perspective is gaining traction among analysts, who argue that current policy decisions are often informed by entrenched attitudes rather than objective assessments.
  
  Turning to the Middle East, the Israel-Iran conflict has entered a new phase marked by what Armstrong describes as “theatrical displays” and “prestidigitation.” The recent temporary halt to hostilities, brokered by Donald Trump, is viewed with skepticism. Armstrong asserts that Iran’s demonstrated military capabilities—particularly in drones and hypersonic missiles—have exceeded prior Western estimates, challenging assumptions about Israel’s security and the effectiveness of U.S. and NATO support. He predicts, with high confidence, that the damage to Israel is “more significant than reported” and that the West’s belief in its own military superiority is being seriously tested.
  
  Meanwhile, NATO’s internal debates and public messaging reflect growing uncertainty. Recent statements by the Secretary General, invoking historical analogies to the Roman Empire and Napoleon, have drawn criticism for their lack of historical awareness and strategic insight. Armstrong humorously questions the competence of NATO’s leadership, suggesting that calls for increased funding are undermined by poor communication and a failure to learn from history.
  
  Looking ahead, the prevailing trend is one of increasing skepticism towards Western narratives and a recognition of shifting power balances. There is a high chance that the West will continue to struggle with the realities of industrial warfare and logistics, particularly in Ukraine, where Russia’s manufacturing base outpaces that of NATO countries. Armstrong concludes that unless Western policymakers adapt to these new realities, their strategic position will continue to erode. Most definitely, the coming months will see further challenges to established assumptions about military power and alliance cohesion.

    url: https://patrickarmstrong.ca/2025/06/24/trumpery-making-something-out-of-hot-air-and-prestidigitation/
    text: 'My goodness! Trump’s done it again. From a mess of bloviation, trash talking,
      boasting, theatrical productions, deception and deflection, empty gestures and
      gas, he’s made something. The Israel-Iran war is apparently stopping (for now).
      And, part of the deal is that we are all supposed to agree that Iran’s nuclear
      program has been obliterated so we must all stop talking about it. (Interesting
      to see how that bit of mental gymnastics is handled.)


      Some people whose analysis I respect (notably “Armchair Warlord” and “Simplicius”)
      suspected a theatrical production from the start (did any B2s even fly there?)
      and I was reminded of other wonderful, spectacular, powerful nothingburgers from
      Trump.1. For example in 2017 the loud and completely ineffective strike on Syria
      with a reprise the next year. Inconsistent inconsistencies I called them. The
      American strike was matched by Tehran’s equally theatrical production today: advance
      warning, loud bangs, victory claims and not much else. (But from Tehran’s perspective
      some more Patriot missiles used up: how many are left in the locker do you suppose?
      600 to be produced this year they say but they keep needing more and more in Ukraine
      and there’s a lot to be replaced in Israel.)


      So, what have we learned?


      Iran is a lot more powerful than many people thought.


      Western air defence systems aren’t very effective.


      Who knew those little Iranian lawnmower-engined dorito drones could get all the
      way to Israel?


      Hypersonic missiles are invulnerable and very frightening.


      Tehran now knows which missiles in its arsenal are most effective and which most
      effectively soak up the enemy’s air defence and will build accordingly


      Tehran’s decision to follow the missile-based armament route is vindicated. Suvorov:
      “Fight the enemy with the weapons he lacks“; Sun Tsu: “avoid strength and strike
      weakness“. `Others will notice.


      Israel has used up the sleeper cells and intelligence penetration that it had
      built up in Iran.


      Questions for the future


      Has Tehran learned that the Kims were right all along?


      Israel was supposed to be the place where Jews were safe; how many feel that way
      now?


      Has Israel learned anything? Its wars have been rather offstage since 1973; the
      people are not used to seeing collapsed buildings in their neighbourhoods.


      Is this the end of Netanyahu?


      Do you think NATO is more cohesive or less cohesive after this 12-day rollercoaster
      ride in which every time they dutifully snapped to attention, they had to salute
      something different?


      My predictions.


      The damage in Israel will be much greater and much more effective than we have
      been told.


      In Iran, not so much.


      One final observation.


      For 500 years, the West has been confident that all the best, the most powerful,
      the most sophisticated weapons have been in its arsenal. That hasn’t been true
      for some time and now the world has seen so. I was fascinated that Israel would
      show these photos of F14s it had destroyed as if it had accomplished something.
      Manned aircraft? That’s so yesterday.'
    one_sentence_summary: The article critiques Trump's handling of the Israel-Iran
      conflict, suggesting it may be more theatrical than substantive, while highlighting
      Iran's newfound military capabilities and questioning the effectiveness of Western
      defense systems, ultimately reflecting on the shifting balance of power in global
      warfare.
    paragraph_summary: The article reflects on the recent developments in the Israel-Iran
      conflict, suggesting that the situation has been shaped by theatrical displays
      from both sides, particularly highlighting Donald Trump's involvement in negotiating
      a temporary halt to hostilities while downplaying Iran's nuclear capabilities.
      Analysts express skepticism about the effectiveness of military actions taken
      by both the U.S. and Iran, noting that Iran has demonstrated greater military
      strength than previously believed, particularly through the use of drones and
      hypersonic missiles. The piece raises critical questions about Israel's security,
      the effectiveness of its intelligence, and the implications for NATO cohesion,
      while predicting that the damage in Israel will be more significant than reported
      and that the West's historical confidence in its military superiority is increasingly
      being challenged.

    url: https://patrickarmstrong.ca/2025/06/04/history-in-natoland/
    text: 'In what was no doubt intended to strike his listeners dumb with awe, the
      current NATO GenSek said today:


      First “defensive”. Do you think Hispania, Britannia, Gallia, Germania, Aegyptus
      would agree? But, more to the point, most of the times you hear the Roman Empire
      mentioned these days, it’s in a sentence like this “the Roman Empire fell because
      it was doing what (insert name of country, or alliance.) is doing now.”


      Not, perhaps, the most felicitous comparison.


      But the other is even worse. As to defensive, see above. But has he forgotten
      a certain decision Napoleon made in 1812 that led to the Russian Army entering
      Paris two years later and inventing the bistro? And this while he’s ginning up
      a fear of Russia? Who briefs these guys: Alfred E Newman? (NOTE: You’d think that
      a guy who had wasted his youth reading Mad magazine would know it was spelled
      Neuman, wouldn’t you? Thanks to a reader)


      My advice to the GenSek is that in his pleading for more money at the end of the
      month, he add that a Directorate of Scary Historical Analogies will be established
      that is actually competent.'
    one_sentence_summary: The NATO Secretary General's recent comments on defense strategies
      have drawn criticism for their historical inaccuracies and questionable comparisons,
      suggesting a need for more competent advisory on historical analogies.
    paragraph_summary: In a recent statement, NATO's Secretary General made a controversial
      claim about the organization's defensive stance, prompting skepticism regarding
      historical comparisons to the Roman Empire and Napoleon's decisions. The article
      critiques the GenSek's remarks, suggesting that they evoke unfavorable historical
      parallels, particularly regarding the fall of empires and military miscalculations.
      It humorously questions the competence of those advising him, implying that a
      more informed approach to historical analogies is needed, especially when advocating
      for increased funding.

  - title: ANTI-RUSSIA THROUGH THE YEARS
    url: https://patrickarmstrong.ca/2025/05/20/anti-russia-through-the-years/
    text: 'One of the things I’ve often heard and seen Russians say is that the West
      has always hated Russia and always will. When it needs Russia it will pretend
      friendship but when the emergency is over it’s back to the same. Britain is often
      named as the chief hater. I’ve filed this away as something Russians believe to
      be true but may be exaggerated; after all, every nation is the innocent hero of
      its own stories. And as Palmerston (of whom more below) said “Nations have no
      permanent friends or allies, they only have permanent interests“. Take Britain
      for example. At the moment London is the principal actor in the anti-Russia/pro-Ukraine
      camp; before that Cold War opponent; then ally against Hitler; then variable;
      then ally against Germany; then opponent in the Great Game; then enemy in the
      Crimean War; then ally against Napoleon and back and forth we go until the first
      and reasonably amicable trade contacts in Elizabeth’s time. From one to the other
      as interests dictated.


      But a month ago I read something that made me wonder if maybe the Russians had
      a point. It was Orlando Figes’ book on the Crimean War and I was astounded to
      see the same anti-Russia tropes that we see today. (All page numbers from Kindle
      edition)


      The first difficulty for the Allied propagandists in this very ostentatiously
      Christian age was to justify going to war against a Christian country in support
      of a Muslim country. For a French newspaper, it was about stopping “the Greek
      heresy [from being] imposed by Cossack arms on all of us”. (209) In Britain by
      the assertion that Christians in the Ottoman Empire were perfectly safe (with
      the British and French overlooking) while Russian dominance would see “their places
      of prayer either demolished, or converted into temples of a faith as impure, demoralizing,
      and intolerant, as Popery itself. What British Christian can hesitate as to the
      course proper for such a country as ours, in such a case as this? (223) Whew!
      Russia, “blessed by inhuman Priests” (368), isn’t really Christian after all.
      (But what an image! Cossack sotnyas galloping through Barsetshire to sabre Archdeacon
      Grantley!)


      And they were as loathsome as their religion. The war was “the crusade of civilization
      against barbarism” (209) “The defence of mankind” against a “hopeless and degenerate
      people” bent upon the conquest of the world, a “religious war”. (224) “For the
      cause of right against injustice”. (223) Against “a country which makes no advances
      in any intellectual or industrial pursuits, and wholly omits to render her influence
      beneficial to the world”. (449) Insolence, arrogance and pride; a “bully”. (554)
      “A Holy War” against the Russians, “heathens”, “infidels” and “savages”. (650)
      An Anglican clergyman thundered that Russia’s offensive against Turkey was an
      attack “on the most sacred rights of our common humanity; an outrage standing
      in the same category as the slave trade, and scarcely inferior to it in crime”.
      (223)


      These horrid people were unrelentingly expansionist. A popular pamphlet dating
      from 1828, On the Designs of Russia, written by a future Crimean War general,
      projected a desire to conquer all of Asia Minor and effect the collapse of British
      trade with India. (73) The foundation of this was the forged Testament of Peter
      the Great (102) which set out a plan to conquer Europe; it was widely quoted for
      years.


      To return to Lord Palmerston. Tremendously influential for decades and Prime Minister
      for the last year of the Crimean War, he was very anti-Russian. As far as he was
      concerned, “The main and real object of the war was to curb the aggressive ambition
      of Russia.” (267) The fighting in the Crimea was just the start and his desired
      result was put forth in his memorandum to the British Cabinet in March 1854. The
      Crimea and Caucasus to the Ottoman Empire; Finland to Sweden, the Baltics to Prussia,
      Bessarabia to Austria, Poland independent. (540) Liberation movements against
      tsarist rule to be supported. (443) (Britain had already been providing weapons
      to Imam Shamyl’s forces in the long-running Caucasus war. (453)) Poland enthusiastically
      supported the idea (449) It was generally expected that the fall of Sevastopol
      would bring Russia to its knees and the Western powers could impose their conditions
      on the Russians. (269) But, when it finally fell in September 1855, Russia didn’t.
      Now what? France, which had done the heaviest fighting, was not sympathetic to
      Palmerston’s desires for more war in the Balkans or the Baltic. The Allies certainly
      weren’t about to commit the forces required to hold Sevastopol. And so they departed
      six months later. As the Emperor himself said “Sevastopol is not Moscow. The Crimea
      is not Russia. Two years after the burning of Moscow, our victorious troops were
      in Paris”. (535) And he was right: at the end the map hadn’t changed much.


      And, of course, people who objected to this were “pro-Russian” and therefore “un-English”
      (204)


      **************************************


      Back then Russia was an autocracy ruled by a man ruling by Divine Right (and the
      Brits happily allied with the last of the series in 1914); then it became “the
      world’s first socialist state” (and the Brits happily allied with that in 1941
      – earlier if Churchill had got his way) and now it’s Russia again but without
      a hereditary ruler and an all-encompassing ideology. None of these changes, apparently,
      have made a bit of difference: still expansionist, all round nasty, contributing
      nothing good to the world, contumacious, better broken up but very unstable and
      soon to collapse. Our side, of course, from its morally immaculate position, is
      ever in defence of the Right. If you disagree, you’re “pro-Russian” and therefore
      “un-English/American/Canadian/European/everything good”.


      We dealing with something here that doesn’t seem to be very fact-based. Maybe
      the Russians do have a point.'
    one_sentence_summary: The article explores the historical perception of Russia as
      a perpetual adversary of the West, particularly Britain, highlighting how anti-Russian
      sentiments have persisted through various conflicts and political changes, leading
      the author to reconsider the validity of Russian claims about Western animosity.
    paragraph_summary: The article explores the long-standing perception among Russians
      that the West, particularly Britain, has historically harbored animosity towards
      Russia, often masking this hostility with temporary alliances based on shifting
      interests. The author reflects on Orlando Figes' book about the Crimean War, which
      reveals that many of the anti-Russian sentiments prevalent during that time echo
      those seen today, portraying Russia as a barbaric and expansionist threat while
      justifying Western intervention as a moral crusade. The piece highlights how British
      leaders, like Lord Palmerston, manipulated public sentiment to support anti-Russian
      policies, framing the conflict as a defense of civilization against a degenerate
      foe. Despite the changing political landscape in Russia—from autocracy to socialism
      and back again—the West's narrative remains largely unchanged, suggesting a persistent
      bias that may indeed validate Russian claims of enduring Western hostility.

  - title: VICTORY DAY 80
    url: https://patrickarmstrong.ca/2025/05/08/victory-day-80/
    text: 'A couple of days ago I read a rather distressing discussion on X about US
      lend-lease to the USSR. Distressing because of the combination of impenetrable
      ignorance and unshakeable conviction. One side yelling that US lend-lease made
      no difference at all and you’re an idiot; the other yelling that it made all the
      difference and you’re the idiot. Like a bunch of drunks arguing about something
      in the Star Wars movies.


      More ignorance on the Western side than on the Russian? Not sure actually in what
      I read although we have to agree that Trump just set the American bar pretty high.
      And it soon degenerated into who Hitler’s best friends were. Each was certain
      that he had all the facts and the other side had none.


      Would the Soviets have beaten the nazis without US (and British and Canadian)
      aid? I’m inclined to think so although certainly at a greater cost and more years
      of struggle. Did the aid make a difference? Of course it did; in food and trucks
      especially. But you can make the argument that the Germans had lost their best
      chance after the Battle of Moscow in 1941 and after Stalingrad there was no chance.
      David Glantz has put it quite neatly I think: the Germans won the summers of 1941
      and 1942 but the Soviets won the other summers and all the winters. Lend-lease
      took some time to build up and didn’t really peak until 1943 so less of an effect
      in those vital years of 1941 and 1942. (Years ago I was surprised to see a Canadian-made
      Valentine tank in a Berlin battle film. Apparently the Soviets liked the tank
      because it was well-armoured and easy to maintain, but I can’t think the 2-pounder
      gun was much use in 1945.)


      Who won the war? The Allies did. But you can’t forget the 80/20 division. Who
      suffered the most? The Soviets undeniably. Where were the most important Axis
      defeats? On the Eastern Front, no question. (Except for the Battle of Britain.)


      Who started the war? Well we all had a responsibility: Stalin spent six years
      trying to organise an anti-Hitler coalition but failed for various reasons and
      then became the last man to do a deal with Hitler. (It was infuriating in those
      X rants and counter-rants when some ignoramus threw out the Ribbentrop-Molotov
      agreement as if that were the final word. The certainty of facts without context.)


      Probably the most noticeable thing on the Western side was the incomprehension
      of the gigantic scale of the fighting on the Eastern Front. I remember remarking
      when I first read Liddell-Hart’s history 40-50 years ago on the disproportionate
      space given to the North African fighting versus the Eastern Front. I have some
      sympathy for him because the Soviets weren’t telling us much then but still. And
      that disproportion persists in the West although there’s no excuse any more. And
      so does the view that the Soviets had no skill: on the contrary, once they got
      going, they beat the Germans strategically and operationally and surprised them
      almost every time. These people should be required to read at least one book by
      Glantz before they’re allowed to open their months again. And listen to the lecture
      by Jonathan House about the three German alibis.


      And from the Russian side the tiresome conviction that D-Day only happened because
      the Western allies saw that the Soviets were winning and felt they’d better jump
      in. No, D-Day happened as soon as it could. I don’t think the Soviets had any
      idea of how difficult a seaborne invasion is against a defended coast. And how
      would they? Have the Russians or Soviets ever done one?


      The Europeans secretly supported Hitler. Yes, many did, but they lost that argument
      in 1939.


      Or Allen Dulles fooling around in Switzerland. He did but it was a personal initiative
      by a guy whose whole career was based on the assumption that the rules were whatever
      he said they were. Unconditional surrender was primarily Roosevelt’s initiative
      and he and Churchill agreed to it in January 1943. That, not Dulles’ fantasies,
      was and remained official policy.


      Operation Unthinkable. Well, maybe the name gives you a clue.


      But over the years much has been forgotten. The clearest example is that opinion
      poll record that shows the French in 1945 knowing the Soviets had played the biggest
      part (80/20) but these days believing the USA had.


      As for Trump’s recent assertion, I have a horrible feeling that most of my neighbours,
      few of whom have ever heard of Canada’s Hundred Days, would agree with him.


      ********************************


      I was there for the 50th. A different time. The Western Allies showed up to do
      honour. In those far-off days we knew the difference between Stepan Bandera and
      Lyudmilla Pavlichenko and which side which was on. Today the Canadian Parliament
      and British VE-Day ceremony organisers have forgotten.


      Which, of course, feeds into the conviction many Russians already have that Marshal
      Zhukov got it right when he (reportedly) said “We have saved Europe from fascism
      and they will never forgive us for it”. (Did he actually say that? Certainly lots
      of Russians seem to think he did.)'

    paragraph_summary: The article discusses a contentious debate on social media regarding
      the impact of US lend-lease aid to the USSR during World War II, highlighting
      the ignorance and strong opinions on both sides. The author suggests that while
      lend-lease aid, particularly in food and trucks, did make a difference, the Soviets
      likely would have defeated the Nazis eventually, albeit at a higher cost. The
      piece emphasizes the significant suffering of the Soviets and the critical victories
      on the Eastern Front, while critiquing the Western misunderstanding of the scale
      of the conflict and the Soviets' military capabilities. It also addresses misconceptions
      about the timing of D-Day and the historical context of various events, noting
      a shift in public perception over time regarding the contributions of the USSR
      versus the US. The author reflects on the changing narratives and the importance
      of historical accuracy, particularly in light of contemporary political discourse.

      was “Russian disinformation”.


      Well, fuhgeddaboudit it! While you were sleeping, disinformation became information
      and there’s a new Party Line now. And here it is. “Key Takeaways From America’s
      Secret Military Partnership With Ukraine: An investigation by The New York Times
      has revealed that America was woven into the war far more than previously known.“


      Of course, as Larry Johnson has pointed out, the real purpose of this propaganda
      shift is the underbussing of the Ukraine disaster.


      I can summarize the massive story in one sentence — Ukraine would have destroyed
      the weak, incompetent Russians if only the Ukrainian generals had followed the
      guidance from the US military. If you’re looking for a signal that the war in
      Ukraine is on its last legs, this article is it. This is a ridiculous attempt
      to burnish the image of the Pentagon and US European Command as strategic and
      tactical geniuses who could have beaten the Russians if only those damn Ukrainians
      had followed their advice.


      It’s the signal for the sheep to start bleating a new tune (remember the scene
      in Nineteen Eighty-Four when, right in the middle of Hate Week, the Enemy becomes
      the Ally? Creepy how much Orwell foresaw, isn’t it?) As “Simplicius” remarks:
      “Of course, most of it is news only to the NPCs who’ve subsisted on main courses
      of MSM consumption.”


      The real news is not what they say; it’s


      that they say it.


      I didn’t bother to read the whole thing but I saw enough to recognise a familiar
      tune. One of the principal themes of my writings in this site is that Washington
      and the West generally have very poor knowledge of Russia (here I am in 2018).
      Most of it is based on unexamined assumptions complacently adhered to. And here
      we see it again. Let’s start a short, victorious war. And we know that it will
      be short and victorious because Russia’s economy is weak and sanctions will collapse
      it in a couple of months; Putin’s underbosses will whack him out if we can make
      them hurt; their weapons are ancient junk; their generals are unimaginative clods;
      their tactics are inept; their soldiers are poorly trained dregs. We. on the other
      hand, are the greatest warriors with the best generals and the best weapons ever.


      My very favourite example of this ill-informed self-satisfied overconfidence all
      in one go from a British source from 2023 just before the big offensive:


      As a former tank commander, I can say one thing for certain: Putin’s demoralised
      conscripts are utterly unprepared for the shock action now hitting their lines.
      Ukrainian armoured formations are beginning to meet Russian forces in battle,
      and they are going to pulverise Russia’s defensive lines. I am confident for one
      simple reason: Ukraine will follow the Western ideology of manoeuvre warfare in
      a combined arms context, while the Russians will follow Soviet doctrine, relying
      on attrition and numbers. The Russians will find that the armour of Western tanks
      is far more resilient than flesh and bone, they will die in great numbers, and
      they will lose.


      Whatever else it may be, war is the ultimate reality test and, when the confident
      assurance fades, step by step, the sunk cost fallacy will drag the West deeper
      into the bog. Babbling about Russia’s dependence on refrigerators is replaced
      by they’re out-producing us four-to-one. The years roll by and it’s suddenly time
      to get out however you can. Just like Vietnam, Iraq and Afghanistan. And, like
      those, no lessons will be learned because we won or at least we would have if
      only the wind hadn’t blown so hard or our allies weren’t so useless or something
      else beyond our control. (Do they read Clausewitz at West Point? Ever heard of
      the Correlation of Forces? How about Sun Tzu’s famous quotation about knowledge?)


      As the toilers at MiniTrue re-write and the Memory Hole burns, we wait for the
      next Russian disinformation to suddenly turn into information. Lots of NATO troops
      in Ukraine? “The Revolution of Dignity” was Made in America? NATO provoked the
      war? Every chance to settle the problem peacefully was torpedoed by Washington
      or London? Ukraine is full of Galician nazis actually making the big decisions?
      Bucha was a fake? So was the maternity hospital?


      *************************************


      (By the way, as most of you already knew, because propaganda is about impressions
      not details, there’s no penalty for failed predictions and the British guy quoted
      above is still at it: “Whisper it, but the tide might just be turning against
      Putin:The American president has lost patience with the Russian leader – so has
      his own people… within Russia’s top brass, the knives are out for their leader”.
      Evidence? A mis-interpretation, two false “facts” and the usual inflated casualty
      figures.)'
    one_sentence_summary: The article critiques the shifting narrative surrounding NATO's
      involvement in the Ukraine conflict, arguing that recent revelations about America's
      deeper military partnership with Ukraine serve to deflect blame for the war's
      failures onto Ukrainian leadership, while highlighting the West's persistent overconfidence
      and misunderstanding of Russia.
    paragraph_summary: The article critiques the evolving narrative surrounding NATO's
      involvement in the Ukraine conflict, highlighting a shift from official statements
      denying any direct engagement with Russia to revelations of deeper U.S. military
      ties with Ukraine, as reported by The New York Times. It suggests that this change
      in messaging serves to deflect blame for Ukraine's struggles onto its military
      leadership, implying that the war could have been won had they adhered to U.S.
      guidance. The author argues that this reflects a broader pattern of Western overconfidence
      and misunderstanding of Russia, reminiscent of past conflicts like Vietnam and
      Iraq, where failure is often attributed to external factors rather than strategic
      miscalculations. The piece warns that as the situation in Ukraine deteriorates,
      the narrative will continue to shift, with past claims being reinterpreted as
      new information, ultimately leading to a deeper entrenchment in the conflict without
      learning from historical lessons.

    url: https://patrickarmstrong.ca/2025/03/12/grok-is-pretty-impressive/
    text: 'I’m sitting here with a glass of Scottish mineral water thinking about the
      differences between the Russian civilisation state and the European civilisation.
      And one of my thoughts is that while European kings are calling themselves kings
      of a people, the Russians already have the concept of the Russian Land.


      So I think to ask Grok.


      First question: “When did the King of England stop being called Rex Anglorum and
      become Rex Angliae?”. Answer: King John (1200s), with lots of details.


      Second question. Ditto for Rex Francorum and Rex Franciae. Answer (again lots
      of intelligent detail): Louis IX (1200s).


      Third question. Русская Земля . Answer 800s.


      That’s pretty impressive. I left out the very detailed and intelligent discussions
      of the questions and the developments over time. Do it yourself.


      *************************


      My experience with Grok has been that it gives you the mean sea level answer to
      your question. But I guess that is to be expected, given that it is sifting the
      Web which is polluted by the MSM. But it’s much faster than Googling it and then
      figuring out the answer from the various pieces of information. (Let alone the
      good old days of spending hours in a library. I spent hours and hours in the Public
      Record Office when it was on Chancery Lane. Gadzooks – let’s see if Grok can do
      my PhD thesis!)


      But as always – and if there is a golden rule to the Net, this is it – you have
      to have a solid basis of knowledge in your own head to start with to give context
      and, as well, the ability to sift wheat from chaff.


      For those of you who fell asleep in language classes: King of the English, King
      of England, King of the French, King of France, Russian Land.


      *************************


      A thought. Thanks to Grok, I write this short burble. In the Google days it would
      have been an essay. In the archive days, it would have been a thesis.'
    one_sentence_summary: The author reflects on the differences between Russian and
      European concepts of statehood, highlighting the historical evolution of royal
      titles in England and France while noting the efficiency of using AI like Grok
      for research compared to traditional methods.
    paragraph_summary: The author reflects on the distinctions between Russian and European
      civilizations, particularly in the context of royal titles and identity, noting
      that while European monarchs refer to themselves as kings of a people, Russians
      have a broader concept of "Russian Land." They pose historical questions to an
      AI tool, Grok, regarding when English and French kings transitioned from being
      called "Rex Anglorum" and "Rex Francorum" to "Rex Angliae" and "Rex Franciae,"
      respectively, with Grok providing detailed answers. The author appreciates Grok's
      efficiency compared to traditional research methods, while also emphasizing the
      importance of having foundational knowledge to critically evaluate information.
      Ultimately, they acknowledge that Grok enables quicker writing, contrasting it
      with the more extensive efforts required in previous research methods.

  - title: AN IDIOT’S GUIDE TO WAR
    url: https://patrickarmstrong.ca/2025/03/03/an-idiots-guide-to-war/
    text: 'There’s a longstanding apothegm about war that says that amateurs talk tactics
      but professionals talk logistics. To this I would add that beginners talk weapons
      (remember Saint Javelin, M777s, Leopard tanks, F-16s? Seen a lot of game changer
      weapons come and go haven’t we?)


      Logistics is the really hard part of planning: it is the business of making sure
      that the fighting end of the effort has all the things that it requires where
      it needs them when it needs them. The end comes when your guy kicks in the door
      of the enemy’s leader’s office. Everything else: aircraft carriers, tank armies,
      artillery, air fleets, medical support, planning is about getting him there. Here’s
      the photo. If the infantryman at the tip of the spear doesn’t have rations and
      ammunition he’s useless and will soon be out of the game. Getting these (and many
      other things) to him is extraordinarily difficult and many popular accounts of
      wars leave this somewhat boring aspect of the war business out of the story.


      But war is a combination of many things all of which have to work together. All
      are necessary but none is sufficient. It is, I believe, the most complicated thing
      humans do (and, depressingly, history shows that it’s our favourite outdoor sport.)
      Saying one part is the most important is plain wrong. War without purpose (grand
      strategy and strategy) is just killing people and smashing things. Soldiers without
      training are dead men walking. Tactics without logistical support is just Brownian
      movement. And so on. Everything has to be planned and coordinated and carried
      out hampered by what Clausewitz called “friction”; against an enemy who’s doing
      everything to upset and counter you. Once you’ve planned it all out, you have
      to start all over again on the fly because “No plan survives contact with the
      enemy“.


      What’s going on in Ukraine is an industrial war which is consuming enormous amounts
      of ammunition and weapons with tremendous destruction and hundreds of thousands
      of casualties. NATO is used to flying over a target with no air defence and dropping
      bombs, or small infantry groups who call in air or artillery when somebody shoots
      at them. And, in the end, NATO loses the war anyway and goes home. Alex Vershinin
      got it right at the beginning in June 2022 in The Return of Industrial Warfare.


      The winner in a prolonged war between two near-peer powers is still based on which
      side has the strongest industrial base. A country must either have the manufacturing
      capacity to build massive quantities of ammunition or have other manufacturing
      industries that can be rapidly converted to ammunition production. Unfortunately,
      the West no longer seems to have either.


      And, it should be clear it could be much more: Moscow calls it a “special military
      operation” and therefore Kiev looks like this; if it were a full-scale war Kiev
      would look like this.


      What do we hear from NATO? More money. Must get to 2% of GDP. That’s not enough,
      3% is needed. Maybe 5%. Money.


      NATO’s money talk and boasting (remember “taking chips from refrigerators” and
      “Russia’s industry is in tatters“; Russia is running out of weapons?) has been
      replaced by some recognition of reality. In January the current NATO GenSek told
      us “When you look what Russia is producing now in three months, it’s what all
      of NATO is producing from Los Angeles up to Ankara in a full year“. Russia is
      four-to-one against the whole enemy coalition.


      It’s production, not money. You don’t fight wars by firing bundles of dollars
      at the enemy. One of the primal errors of Western intelligence was measuring Russia’s
      economy using the ruble to USD exchange rate. (NATO GenSek still believes it though:
      “Russia is not bigger than the Netherlands and Belgium combined as an economy“.)
      In 2017 I wrote Exchange Rating Russia Down and Out which I concluded by saying
      Russia had a “full service economy”. And, whatever the GenSek may imagine, the
      World Bank tells us that “the Netherlands and Belgium combined” with its “industry
      in tatters” has become the fourth-largest economy in the world.


      There is nothing that money can do to remedy the four-to-one ratio except with
      a lot of investment in production over a long time. Thanks to offshoring manufacturing,
      the Western industrial base mostly has to be built from the ground up. Is that
      even possible? If you think about it, an apprentice machinist on an assembly line
      fifty years ago was being taught how to do it by a master machinist who had been
      taught by a previous master and so on back to the middle of the 1700s when industrial
      production was invented. Each in the series advanced the technique, of course,
      but it’s still a chain you could trace back, machinist by machinist, for all that
      time. If that sequence of teacher-learner-teacher is broken, if the teacher has
      retired or died leaving no apprentices, how long will it take to get it back?
      Putting a pallet of engraved paper in the floor of an empty building and hoping
      it will turn into a pallet of artillery rounds is magic thinking. We know this
      from history. By winter 1914 it was evident that artillery ammunition consumption
      far exceeded anybody’s expectations and Britain, a manufacturing giant then, started
      tooling up. Even so it took a year and a half to manufacture the vast number of
      artillery rounds for the Somme offensive and about a quarter of them did not explode
      because the fuses weren’t properly made. How far away is the West from meeting
      the real demand?


      Meanwhile, the EU economy isn’t doing so well and, with a stagnant or shrinking
      economy, just keeping the same amount of money flowing means that the percentage
      will have to grow. So the planned 3-4-5-whatever percent GDP increase they’re
      all calling for may turn out to be just enough to maintain the existing inadequate
      amount. As the Red Queen told Alice: “Now, here, you see, it takes all the running
      you can do, to keep in the same place. If you want to get somewhere else, you
      must run at least twice as fast as that!“


      The ends of “Last Summer’s Ukraine“, NATO and the EU are visible, don’t you think?


      Beginners talk weapons;


      Amateurs talk tactics;


      Professionals talk logistics;


      Idiots talk money.'
    one_sentence_summary: The article emphasizes that while discussions about weapons
      and tactics are common in warfare, the true complexity and critical importance
      lie in logistics and industrial capacity, particularly in the context of the ongoing
      conflict in Ukraine, where the West's reliance on financial resources may not
      suffice against Russia's superior production capabilities.
    paragraph_summary: The article emphasizes the critical importance of logistics in
      warfare, arguing that while discussions often center on weapons and tactics, the
      true challenge lies in ensuring that military forces have the necessary supplies
      and support to operate effectively. It highlights the ongoing conflict in Ukraine
      as an example of industrial warfare, where the side with the stronger manufacturing
      base is likely to prevail. The author critiques NATO's focus on financial contributions
      rather than addressing the fundamental need for increased production capacity,
      pointing out that Russia's industrial output significantly outpaces that of NATO
      countries. The piece concludes by stressing that without a robust industrial foundation
      and a skilled workforce, the West may struggle to meet the demands of modern warfare,
      ultimately suggesting that discussions about military strategy should prioritize
      logistics over monetary considerations.

      European nation need to start enriching Uranium and building nuclear weapons NOW!




      Because once we are in a confrontation with russia it will be too late.




      Because the moment putin’s spies tell him a European nation is producing fissile
      materials he will nuke European cities.


      This (posted yesterday) from one of my favourite pro-Ukraine accounts on X. What
      I particularly enjoy is that he has pinned (ie the first thing you see on his
      X account home page) that Russia has already lost the war in Ukraine and that
      Putin is doomed and he knows it. This dated three years ago.


      Think about what he’s saying above: Europeans have to start building nukes to
      protect themselves from Russia and, as soon as they do, Russia will nuke them.'
    one_sentence_summary: The article highlights a collection of extreme and often ignorant
      comments regarding Russia, including a call for European nations to develop nuclear
      weapons for self-defense against a perceived imminent threat from Russia, while
      also critiquing the contradictory nature of such statements.
    paragraph_summary: The article presents a collection of anonymous comments reflecting
      extreme hostility towards Russia and a lack of understanding of the current geopolitical
      situation. One notable comment urges European nations to begin enriching uranium
      and developing nuclear weapons immediately, warning that Russia, led by Putin,
      would respond with nuclear strikes if they detect such activities. This sentiment
      is echoed by a pro-Ukraine account on X, which claims that Russia has already
      lost the war in Ukraine and that Putin is aware of his impending doom. The juxtaposition
      of advocating for nuclear armament while simultaneously asserting that Russia
      is on the brink of defeat highlights a paradoxical and alarmist perspective on
      European security in relation to Russia.
