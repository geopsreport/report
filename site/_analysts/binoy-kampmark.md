summary: |
  Geopolitical tensions continue to intensify across several regions, with recent independent analyses highlighting the deepening crisis in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, ongoing debates over the role of corporate complicity in conflict, and the shifting landscape of press freedom in the United States.
  
  The latest focus has been on the West Bank, where **Binoy Kampmark** draws attention to the normalization of extremist settler ideologies and the increasing violence against Palestinians, as exposed in Louis Theroux's documentary "The Settlers." The documentary underscores not only the religiously motivated expansionism but also the growing support from both the Israeli government and private sector for these actions. According to **Kampmark**, this signals a "troublingly normalized colonial project" that is further entrenching systemic oppression and making prospects for a peaceful resolution increasingly remote.
  
  On the international legal and economic front, a new UN Human Rights Council report by Francesca Albanese, discussed by **Kampmark**, accuses a range of corporate entities of profiting from what is described as Israel's "economy of genocide." The report alleges that companies across various sectors are facilitating occupation and human rights violations, a claim that has been met with strong denials from Israeli and US officials. The backlash illustrates the entrenched divisions over accountability and the role of economic interests in perpetuating conflict.
  
  Meanwhile, in the United States, the precedent set by Julian Assange's recent conviction is reverberating through the political and media landscape. **Kampmark** notes that former President Donald Trump, who once championed WikiLeaks, is now considering the use of the Espionage Act against journalists. This shift raises significant concerns about the future of press freedom, with the potential for expanded prosecutions under national security pretexts.
  
  Looking ahead, the majority of analysts, including **Kampmark**, predict with high confidence that the situation in the West Bank will deteriorate further as settler violence becomes more institutionalized and international accountability remains elusive. The debate over corporate complicity in conflict is expected to intensify, particularly as more evidence emerges and as global economic actors face mounting scrutiny. In the US, there is a high chance that the legal environment for journalists will become more restrictive, setting a precedent that could influence other democracies.
  
  Overall, the prevailing trend is one of escalating confrontation—whether on the ground in occupied territories, in international legal forums, or in the battle over information and accountability.

  - title: 'The Fanatic’s Gaze: Louis Theroux and the West Bank Settlers'
    url: https://www.counterpunch.org/2025/07/08/the-fanatics-gaze-louis-theroux-and-the-west-bank-settlers/
    text: 'He has made it his bread and butter for years: finding society’s kooky representatives,
      the marginal, the crazed and the touched. But what makes Louis Theroux’s The Settlers
      troubling is its examination of a seemingly inexorable process in the West Bank,
      one that has, at its core, a religious, nationalist goal of cleansing and violent
      purification. The documentary captures Israel’s modern colonial project in real
      time, and it is one most ugly.


      The target of the cleansing and eradication – the Palestinians in the West Bank
      – is awesomely horrific, rationalised by suffocating checkpoints, brooding military
      posts and endless harassing points of invigilation. Having already made The Ultra
      Zionists, a documentary on the same subject in 2011, Theroux finds, notably after
      the attacks by Hamas on Israel on October 7, 2023, a missionary project of hardened
      purpose. The edge on the “ultra” has been taken off. The fringe has moved to the
      centre.


      Sanitised areas (the language of ethnic scrubbing) pullulate with armed settlers
      holding forth with pious defiance in outposts of a land seen as promised to them.
      One figure interviewed, the gun-toting Texas-born settler Ari Abramowitz, sees
      the Bible as supplying Jews “a land deed to the West Bank.” Palestinian shopfronts
      remain closed for security reasons, and Palestinians barred from visiting designated
      areas without appropriate approval. Theroux’s guide and local peace activist Issa
      Amro is unable to accompany him to areas in Hebron where settlers are offered
      continuous military protection.


      When Theroux and his guides visit a ruined Palestinian home in Tuwuni in the night,
      an IDF patrol with laser sights is not far behind. At one checkpoint, Theroux
      is accosted by a balaclava-wearing Israeli soldier, provoking him to bark “Don’t
      touch me”. They are solid reminders to Palestinians living in the West Bank that
      they are living on borrowed time, a measure that diminishes with each day.


      Daniella Weiss emerges as a central character, a figure who has led the Israeli
      settler movement for half a century. She reveals being clandestinely escorted
      by the sympathetic soldiers of the Israeli Defense Forces into Gaza to scout for
      possible future settlements. (800 families, goes the proud claim, await moving
      into them.) She grins, mocks and scorns, but does, at some point, demonstrate
      to Theroux her view about settler violence. For her, it does not exist. In that
      familiar pattern, even if it did exist, it would be justifiable because of Palestinian
      violence. When Theroux says he had seen a video of a Palestinian being shot, Weiss
      retorts that the Israel shooter was merely retaliating. She proceeds to shove
      him, hoping he returns the serve. He considers the display sociopathic. Yet sociopathy
      and the limitless well of self-defence are firm friends for Weiss and any number
      of IDF personnel and lawyers who see their cause as worthy. All are incapable
      of violence, incapable of genocide.


      Critics have taken issue with the lens of the documentary, suggesting that the
      camera can deceive because of its sharp focus. The sampling of settlers shows
      them as almost comically villainous, their fanaticism icy and cruelty assured.
      The British-Palestinian writer and activist John Aziz was frustrated by the “selection
      of nasty extremists who lurched between denying the existence of Palestinians
      and expressing the desire to conquer more land and drive out the Arab inhabitants.”
      He even takes issue with the keen interest in Weiss, curious given that any program
      about Israeli settlements would look bare without her starring role.


      Aziz misses the point in his demand for an elusive nuance. People once seen as
      marginalised pioneers seeking land in the West Bank have become the spear of the
      government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. After October 7, 2023, it has
      become modish to entertain notions of expulsion, dispossession and seizure, to
      finally bury Palestinian notions of self-determination. National security minister
      Itamar Ben-Gvir, leader of the far-right Otzma Yehudit party and follower of the
      teachings of Meir Kahane, a Brooklyn rabbi who, after moving to Israel, declared
      “the idea of a democratic Jewish state [a] nonsense”, is symptomatic of this shift.
      Convicted on eight charges, among them supporting a terrorist organisation and
      incitement to racism, Ben-Gvir regularly advocates ethnic cleansing of both the
      West Bank and Gaza.


      In May this year, the Israeli Security Cabinet initiated the land registration
      process in Area C in the West Bank, a process which determines final ownership
      of land and extinguishes other claims. The Ministry of Defense was unequivocal
      about the goal of this move in a statement: “to strengthen, consolidate, and expand
      Jewish settlement in Judea and Samaria.”


      While the Israeli settlers seem to fail to see the Palestinians as human beings
      with valid territorial claims, international law has little time for the legality
      of the settlements. They are structures of a colonising project, and one regarded
      as unlawful. In its advisory opinion from July 2024, the International Court of
      Justice found that Israel’s continued presence in the Occupied Palestinian Territory
      was “a wrongful act of a continuing character which has been brought about by
      Israel’s violations, through its policies and practices, of the prohibition on
      the acquisition of territory by force and the right to self-determination of the
      Palestinian people.”


      The settler project can also count on abundant support from the private sector.
      In her report to the UN Human Rights Council From economy of occupation to economy
      of genocide Francesca Albanese, the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human
      rights in the Palestinian territories occupied since 1967, lashes “corporate entities”
      international and local who have been enriched by “the Israeli economy of illegal
      occupation, apartheid and now genocide.” This includes heavy investments in the
      West Bank colonising enterprise, be it through supplying logistics, construction
      equipment and building materials. With the Israeli settlers being the shock troops
      of the Israeli State, Weiss’s boast captured by Theroux is being realised: “We
      do for governments what they can’t do for themselves.”'
    one_sentence_summary: Louis Theroux's documentary "The Settlers" troublingly exposes
      the violent and religiously motivated colonial project in the West Bank, highlighting
      the normalization of extremist settler ideologies and the systemic oppression
      of Palestinians, amidst a backdrop of increasing support from the Israeli government
      and private sector for these actions.
    paragraph_summary: Louis Theroux's documentary "The Settlers" delves into the troubling
      realities of Israel's colonial project in the West Bank, highlighting the religious
      and nationalist motivations behind the ongoing displacement and oppression of
      Palestinians. Through interviews with settlers, including prominent figures like
      Daniella Weiss, the film reveals a stark shift in Israeli society where extremist
      views have moved from the fringe to the mainstream, particularly following the
      Hamas attacks on October 7, 2023. The documentary captures the harsh conditions
      faced by Palestinians, including military checkpoints and violence, while settlers
      justify their actions through a distorted interpretation of biblical entitlement.
      Critics argue that the film's portrayal of settlers lacks nuance, yet it underscores
      a broader trend of state-supported ethnic cleansing and the complicity of corporate
      interests in the occupation. The International Court of Justice has deemed these
      settlements unlawful, yet the Israeli government continues to expand its presence
      in the region, reflecting a grim reality for Palestinian self-determination.

  - title: 'An Economy of Genocide: Israel and the Albanese Report'
    url: https://www.counterpunch.org/2025/07/07/an-economy-of-genocide-israel-and-the-albanese-report/
    text: 'It makes for stark and dark reading. The report for the UN Human Rights Council
      titled From economy of occupation to economy of genocide makes mention of “corporate
      entities” who have been enriched by “the Israeli economy of illegal occupation,
      apartheid and now genocide.” Authored by the relentless Francesca Albanese, the
      Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories
      occupied since 1967, it is unflinching in its assessments and warnings to companies
      doing business with Israel.


      What makes the investigative undertaking by Albanese useful is its examination
      of the corporate world and its links to the colonial, settler program of removing
      and displacing a pre-existing population. The machinery of conquest of any state
      necessarily involves not only the desk job occupants in civilian bureaucracies
      and high-ranking military commanders, but those in the corporate sector, eager
      to make a profit. “Colonial endeavours and associated genocides,” writes Albanese,
      “have historically been driven and enabled by the corporate sector. Commercial
      interests have contributed to the dispossession of Indigenous peoples of their
      lands – a mode of domination known as ‘colonial racial capitalism’.”


      Eight private sectors come in for scrutiny: arms manufacturers, tech firms, building
      and construction entities, those industries concerned with extraction and services,
      banks, pension funds, insurers, universities and charities. “These entities enable
      the denial of self-determination and other structural violations in the occupied
      Palestinian territory, including occupation, annexation and crimes of apartheid
      and genocide, as well as a long list of ancillary crimes and human rights violations,
      from discrimination, wanton destruction, forced displacement and pillage to extrajudicial
      killing and starvation.”


      Central to the multifaceted economy of genocide, the report charges, is the military-industrial
      complex that forms “the economic backbone of the State.” Albanese cites a stellar
      example: the F-35 fighter jet, developed by US-based Lockheed Martin, in collaboration
      with hundreds of other companies “including Italian manufacturer Leonardo S.p.A,
      and eight States.”


      Since October 2023, the process of colonisation and displacement has assumed an
      air of urgency, aided by the private sector. In 2024, US$200 million was advanced
      for “colony construction”. Between November 2023 and October 2024, 57 new colonies
      and outposts were established “with Israeli and international companies supplying
      machinery, raw materials and logistical support.” Examples include the maintenance
      and expansion of the Jerusalem Light Rail Red Line, the construction of the new
      Green Line, encompassing 27 kilometres of new tracks and 50 stations in the West
      Bank. The infrastructure has proven to be invaluable in linking the colonial project
      to West Jerusalem. Despite some companies withdrawing from the project “owing
      to international pressure”, an entity such as the Spanish/Basque Construcciones
      y Auxiliar de Ferrocarriles has been a keen participant, along with suppliers
      of excavating machinery (South Korea’s Doosan and Sweden’s Volvo Group), and providers
      of materials for the light-rail bridge (Germany’s Heidelberg Materials AG).


      Beyond the structural and physical program of construction and displacement, all
      designed to extinguish any semblance of self-determination on the part of the
      Palestinians, come other features of the colonial project. A prominent feature
      of this, Albanese notes, is that of “surveillance and carcerality”. Repressing
      Palestinians has become a “progressively automated” affair, with tech companies
      feeding Israel’s voracious security appetite with “unparalleled developments in
      carceral and surveillance devices”, some of which include closed-circuit television
      networks, biometric surveillance, advanced tech checkpoint networks, drone surveillance
      and cloud computing.


      Palantir Technologies Inc., a specialist in software platforms, comes in for a
      special mention. “There are reasonable grounds to believe Palantir has provided
      automatic predictive policing technology, core defence infrastructure for rapid
      and scale-up construction and deployment of military software, and its Artificial
      Intelligence Platform, which allows real-time battlefield data integration for
      automated decision making.”


      Middle East Eye that foreign military sales were not their preserve as far as
      accountability or cause of concern was, a lofty, business-like attitude unshackled
      from a moral compass. Such sales took place between governments, meaning that
      the US government would be best placed to answer any questions. Hand washing and
      deferrals of guilt is a private sector speciality after all. With the report released,
      the dance of dissimulation began. Lockheed Martin told thethat foreign military
      sales were not their preserve as far as accountability or cause of concern was,
      a lofty, business-like attitude unshackled from a moral compass. Such sales took
      place between governments, meaning that the US government would be best placed
      to answer any questions. Hand washing and deferrals of guilt is a private sector
      speciality after all.


      In a more direct fashion, both Israel and the United States have continued their
      “Hate Albanese” campaign, boringly reiterating old accusations while adopting
      novel interpretations of international law. Given the obvious loathing of international
      human rights conventions by Israeli officials and their US backers, this is decidedly
      rich, even more so given such jurisprudence as that of the International Court
      of Justice’s Advisory Opinion of July 2024, and the International Criminal Court
      arrest warrants for Israeli officials, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
      (These developments figure prominently in Albanese’s assessment.)


      According to the ICJ, all States were under an obligation to “cooperate with the
      United Nations” on ensuring “an end to Israel’s illegal presence in the Occupied
      Territory and the full realization of the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination”.
      Israel’s continued presence in the OPT was illegal. “It is a wrongful act of a
      continuing character which has been brought about by Israel’s violations, through
      its policies and practices, of the prohibition on the acquisition of territory
      by force and the right to self-determination of the Palestinian people.”


      The Washington Free Beacon took issue with Albanese’s supposed record of “virulent
      antisemitism and support for terrorism”, bitchily sniping at her legal qualifications.
      Little is actually mentioned of international law in the bilious missive by US
      Ambassador Dorothy C. Shea, acting representative to the UN, other than a snotty
      dismissal of UN General Assembly resolutions and advisory opinions by the International
      Court of Justice as lacking any binding force “on either States or private actors”.
      From Israel came the view that the report was “legally groundless, defamatory
      and a flagrant abuse of [Albanese’s] office.” A June 20 letter to UN Secretary-General
      António Guterres from the Trump administration obtained bytook issue with Albanese’s
      supposed record of “virulent antisemitism and support for terrorism”, bitchily
      sniping at her legal qualifications. Little is actually mentioned of international
      law in the bilious missive by US Ambassador Dorothy C. Shea, acting representative
      to the UN, other than a snotty dismissal of UN General Assembly resolutions and
      advisory opinions by the International Court of Justice as lacking any binding
      force “on either States or private actors”.


      Shea claims Albanese “misrepresented her qualifications for the role by claiming
      to be an international lawyer despite admitting publicly that she has not passed
      a legal bar examination or been licensed to practice law.” A fabulous accusation,
      given the surfeit of allegedly qualified legal members working in the Israeli
      Defense Forces and other offices executing their program of displacement, starvation
      and killing.


      The accusations against various corporate entities, notably over 20 US entities,
      were “riddled with inflammatory rhetoric and false accusations”, making such daring
      claims of “gross human rights violations”, “apartheid” and “genocide”. These charges,
      ventured through letters of accusation, constituted “an unacceptable campaign
      of political and economic warfare against the American and worldwide economy.”


      It comes as little surprise that the security rationale – one that says nothing
      of the Palestinian right to self-determination, let alone rights to life and necessaries
      – marks the entire complaint against Albanese’s apparent lack of impartiality.
      “Business activities specifically targeted by Ms. Albanese contribute to and help
      strengthen national security, economic prosperity, and human welfare across the
      Middle East, North Africa, and Europe.” Just don’t mention the Palestinians.'
    one_sentence_summary: A UN Human Rights Council report by Francesca Albanese accuses
      corporate entities of profiting from Israel's "economy of genocide" against Palestinians,
      highlighting their roles in facilitating occupation and human rights violations
      through various sectors, while facing backlash from Israeli and US officials who
      dismiss the report's claims as unfounded.
    paragraph_summary: The UN Human Rights Council report titled "From economy of occupation
      to economy of genocide," authored by Francesca Albanese, critiques the involvement
      of corporate entities in the Israeli occupation and alleged genocide against Palestinians.
      Albanese highlights how various sectors, including arms manufacturers, tech companies,
      and construction firms, profit from and contribute to the ongoing displacement
      and human rights violations in the occupied territories. The report emphasizes
      the role of the military-industrial complex, citing examples like the F-35 fighter
      jet, and details how companies are complicit in infrastructure projects that facilitate
      colonization. Despite some companies withdrawing due to international pressure,
      many continue to support these operations, while tech firms provide advanced surveillance
      tools to repress Palestinian populations. The report has drawn backlash from Israel
      and the US, with accusations of bias against Albanese and dismissals of her legal
      qualifications, reflecting a broader tension over accountability and the interpretation
      of international law regarding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

      Espionage Act'
    url: https://www.counterpunch.org/2025/07/03/trump-leakers-and-journalists-the-assange-precedent-and-revisiting-the-espionage-act/
    text: 'When campaigning in 2016, presidential candidate Donald Trump was delighted
      by leaked, hacked or disclosed material that wound its way to the digital treasure
      troves of WikiLeaks. The online publisher of government secrets had become an
      invaluable resource for Trump’s battering of the Democratic establishment hopeful,
      Hillary Clinton, with her nonchalant attitude to the security of email communications
      and a venal electoral strategy. “Very little pick-up by the dishonest media of
      incredible information provided by WikiLeaks,” he tooted on what was then Twitter.
      “So dishonest! Rigged system!” After winning the keys to the White House, he mysteriously
      forgot the organisation whose fruit he so merrily feasted on.


      During the Biden administration, the fate of the founding publisher of WikiLeaks,
      an Australian national who had never been on American soil and had published classified
      US defence and diplomatic material outside the country (Cablegate was a gem; Collateral
      Murder, a chilling exposure of atrocity in Baghdad), was decided. Kept in the
      excruciating, spiritually crushing conditions of Belmarsh Prison in London for
      over five years, Julian Assange was convicted under the US Espionage Act of 1917
      in June 2024, the victim of a relic dusted and burnished for deployment against
      the Fourth Estate. Assange’s conviction on one count of conspiracy to obtain and
      disclose national defence information has paved a grim road for future prosecutions
      against the press, a pathway previously not taken for its dangers.


      With this nasty legacy, recent threats by Trump against journalists who published
      and discussed the findings of a leaked preliminary report from the Defense Intelligence
      Agency are hard to dismiss. The report dared question the extent of damage inflicted
      on Iran’s nuclear facilities by Operation Midnight Hammer, which involved 75 precision
      guided munitions in all. “Monumental Damage was done to all Nuclear sites in Iran,
      as shown by satellite images,” Trump asserted with beaming confidence. “Obliteration
      is an accurate term!”


      CNN and The New York Times duly challenged the account in discussing the findings
      of the short DIA report. Damage to the program had not been as absolute as hoped,
      setting it back by a matter of months rather than years. This sent Secretary of
      Defense Pete Hegseth into a state of apoplexy, haranguing those press outlets
      who “cheer against Trump so hard, it’s like in your DNA and in your blood”. For
      his part, Trump accused the Democrats on a Truth Social post of leaking “information
      on the PERFECT FLIGHT on the Nuclear Sites in Iran”, demanding their prosecution.
      He further charged his personal lawyer to harangue The New York Times with a letter
      demanding it “retract and apologize for” the article, one it claimed was “false”
      and “defamatory”.


      To Maria Bartiromo of Fox Business, Trump also added that reporters could be forced
      to reveal their sources on “National Security” grounds. “We can find out. If they
      want to, we can find out easily. You go up and tell a reporter, ‘National security,
      who gave it?’ You have to do that, and I suspect we’ll be doing things like that.”


      According to Rollingstone, the President has already queried whether the press
      could be snared by the Espionage Act. While the magazine misses a beat in ignoring
      the Assange precedent, it notes the current administration’s overly stimulated
      interest in the statute. Prior to returning to the White House, Trump and his
      inner circle considered how the Act could be used not only to target leakers in
      government and whistleblowers “but against media outlets that received classified
      or highly sensitive information”. The publication relies on two sources who had
      discussed the matter with the President.


      One source, a senior Trump administration official, insists that the Act has again
      come up specifically regarding reports on the efficacy of the US strike on Iran’s
      nuclear facilities. Members of the administration are “looking for the right case
      to launch their ‘maiden voyage’ of an unprecedented type of Espionage Act prosecution”,
      one designed to deter news outlets from publishing classified government information
      or concealing the identities of their leaking sources. “All we’d really need is
      one text or email from a reporter telling a source: ‘Can you pull something for
      me?’ or something very direct of that nature’.” A less ignorant source would not
      have to look far for the one existing, successful example in the US prosecutor’s
      kit.


      When pressed on the issue of whether the espionage statute would become the spear
      for the administration to target leakers and journalists, White House spokesperson
      Anna Kelly was broad in reply: “Leaking classified information is a crime, and
      anyone who threatens American national security in this manner should be held
      accountable.”


      The unanswered question regarding Assange’s prosecution and eventual conviction
      remains the possible and fundamental role played by the Constitution’s First Amendment
      protecting press freedom. Unfortunately, the central ghastliness of the Espionage
      Act is its subversion of free speech and motive. Given the Australian publisher’s
      plea deal, the mettle of that defence was never tested in court.


      Some members of Congress have shown a worthy interest in that valuable right,
      notably in the context of defending Assange. In their November 8, 2023 letter
      to President Joe Biden, sixteen lawmakers spanning both sides of politics, including
      Trump loyalist Marjorie Taylor Greene and progressive Democrat Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez,
      declared their commitment “to the principles of free speech and freedom of the
      press” in urging the withdrawal of the US extradition request for Assange. Unfortunately,
      and significantly, that request was ignored.


      Where Greene and other MAGA cheerleaders sit on Trump’s dangerous enchantment
      with the Espionage Act remains to be seen, notably on the issue of prosecuting
      publishers and journalists. MAGA can be incorrigibly fickle, especially when attuned
      to the authoritarian impulses of their great helmsman.'

      about the implications for future press prosecutions.
    paragraph_summary: The article discusses the evolving relationship between Donald
      Trump, Julian Assange, and the implications of the Espionage Act on press freedom.
      During his 2016 campaign, Trump celebrated WikiLeaks for providing damaging information
      about Hillary Clinton but later distanced himself from the organization after
      winning the presidency. Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, was convicted under
      the Espionage Act in 2024, raising concerns about future prosecutions of journalists
      and media outlets for publishing classified information. Trump's recent threats
      against journalists discussing a leaked Defense Intelligence Agency report on
      Iran's nuclear facilities suggest a potential revival of using the Espionage Act
      to target the press, with administration officials reportedly seeking a case to
      deter media from publishing sensitive information. Despite some bipartisan congressional
      support for Assange's press freedom rights, the Biden administration has ignored
      calls to withdraw the extradition request against him, leaving the future of press
      freedom under the Espionage Act uncertain.

    text: 'The confidence trickster was at it again on his visit to The Hague, reluctantly
      meeting members of the overly large family that is NATO. President Donald Trump
      was hoping to impress upon all present that allies of the United States, whatever
      inclination and whatever their domestic policy, should spend mightily on defence,
      inflating the margins of sense and sensibility against marginal threats. Never
      mind the strain placed on the national budget over such absurd priorities as welfare,
      health or education.


      The marvellous irony in this is that much of the budget increases have been prompted
      by Trump’s perceived unreliability and capriciousness when it comes to European
      affairs. Would he, for instance, treat obligations of collective defence outlined
      in Article 5 of the organisation’s governing treaty with utmost seriousness? Since
      Washington cannot be relied upon to hold the fort against the satanic savages
      from the East, various European countries have been encouraging a spike in defence
      spending to fight the sprites and hobgoblins troubling their consciences at night.


      The European Union, for instance, has put in place initiatives that will make
      getting more weaponry and investing in the military industrial complex easier
      than ever, raising the threshold of defence expenditure across all member countries
      to 3.5% of GDP by the end of the decade. And then there is the Ukraine conflict,
      a war Brussels cannot bear to see end on terms that might be remotely favourable
      to Russia.


      The promised pecuniary spray made at the NATO summit was seen by NATO Secretary
      General Mark Rutte as utterly natural if not eminently sensible. Not much else
      was. It was Rutte who remarked with infantile fawning that “Sometimes Daddy has
      to use tough language” when it came to sorting out the murderous bickering between
      Israel and Iran. Daddy Trump approved. “He likes me, I think he likes me,” the
      US president crowed with glowing satisfaction.


      Rutte’s behaviour has been viewed with suspicion, as well it should. Under his
      direction, NATO headquarters have made a point of diminishing any focus on climate
      change and its Women, Peace, and Security agenda. He has failed to make much of
      Trump’s mania for the annexation of Greenland, or the President’s gladiatorial
      abuse of certain leaders when visiting the White House – Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelensky
      and South Africa’s Cyril Ramaphosa come to mind. “He is not paid to implement
      MAGA policy,” grumbled a European NATO diplomat to Euroactive.


      In his doorstep statement of June 25, Rutte made his wish known that the NATO
      collective possess both the money and capabilities to cope, not just with Russia
      “but also the massive build-up of military in China, and the fact that North Korea,
      China and Iran, are supporting the war effort in Ukraine”. Lashings of butter
      were also added to the Trump ego when responding to questions. “Would you really
      think that the seven or eight countries not at 2% [of GDP expenditure on defence]
      at the beginning of this year would have reached the 2% if Trump would not have
      been elected President of the United States?” It was only appropriate, given the
      contributions of the US (“over 50% of the total NATO economy”), that things had
      to change for the Europeans and Canadians.


      The centrepiece of the Hague Summit Declaration is a promise that 5% of member
      countries’ gross GDP will go to “core defence requirements as well as defence
      and security-related spending by 2035 to ensure our individual and collective
      obligations”. Traditional bogeyman Russia is the predictable antagonist, posing
      a “long-term threat […] to Euro-Atlantic security”, but so was “the persistent
      threat of terrorism”. The target is optimistic, given NATO’s own recent estimates
      that nine members spend less than the current target of 2% of GDP.


      What is misleading in the declaration is the accounting process: the 3.5% of annual
      GDP that will be spent “on the agreed definition of NATO defence expenditure by
      2035 to resource core defence requirements, and to meet NATO Capability Targets”
      is one component. The other 1.5%, a figure based on a creative management of accounts,
      is intended to “protect our critical infrastructure, defend our networks, ensure
      our civil preparedness and resilience, unleash innovation, and strengthen our
      defence industrial base.”


      Another misleading element in the declaration is the claimed unanimity of member
      states. The Baltic countries and Poland are forever engaged in increasing their
      defence budgets in anticipation of a Russian attack, but the same cannot be said
      of other countries less disposed to the issue. Slovakia’s Prime Minister Robert
      Fico, for instance, declared on the eve of the summit that his country had “better
      things to spend money on”. Spain’s Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez has also called
      the 5% target “incompatible with our world view”, preferring to focus on a policy
      of prudent procurement.


      Rutte seemed to revel in his role as wallah and jesting sycophant, making sure
      Trump was not only placated but massaged into a state of satisfaction. It was
      a sight all the stranger for the fact that Trump’s view of Russian President Vladimir
      Putin, is a warm one. Unfortunately for the secretary general, his role will be
      forever etched in the context of European history as an aspiring warmonger, one
      valued at 5% of the GDP of any of the NATO member states. Hardly a flattering
      epitaph.'
    one_sentence_summary: During his visit to The Hague, President Trump pressured NATO
      allies to significantly increase defense spending despite concerns over domestic
      priorities, while European nations, driven by uncertainty about U.S. reliability,
      are already planning substantial military investments, highlighting a complex
      dynamic of dependency and skepticism within the alliance.
    paragraph_summary: During President Donald Trump's visit to The Hague, he emphasized
      the need for NATO allies to significantly increase their defense spending, despite
      the potential strain on national budgets that could otherwise support welfare,
      health, and education. This push for higher military expenditure stems from concerns
      over Trump's unpredictability regarding European defense commitments, prompting
      European nations to bolster their military capabilities in response to perceived
      threats from Russia and other nations. NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte's enthusiastic
      support for Trump's agenda, including a commitment to raise defense spending to
      5% of GDP by 2035, drew skepticism from some member states, particularly those
      prioritizing other domestic issues over military funding. The summit highlighted
      divisions within NATO, as not all members are aligned with the aggressive spending
      targets, and Rutte's role as a sycophant to Trump has raised questions about his
      leadership and the future direction of NATO amidst ongoing geopolitical tensions.

  - title: 'Hastie’s Sensible Advice: More Transparency on US Forces in Australia'
    url: https://www.counterpunch.org/2025/06/27/hasties-sensible-advice-more-transparency-on-us-forces-in-australia/
    text: 'It was a blast to a past wiped out by amnesia, social media and mental decrepitude.
      Andrew Hastie, Australia’s opposition minister for home affairs, had been moved
      by an idea: greater transparency was needed regarding the US military buildup
      in Australia. It was an inspiration overdue by some decades, but it was worthwhile
      in its unaccustomed sensibility.


      In an interview with the Insiders program on the ABC, Hastie proved startling
      in proposing that Australia needed “to have a much more mature discussion about
      our relationship with the United States. I think we need greater transparency.”
      He proceeded to recall the frankness of US Secretary of Defense Peter Hegseth’s
      testimony before the US Senate Armed Services Committee, which saw China named
      “as the pacing threat” in the Indo Pacific. Australia, Japan and the Philippines
      were mentioned as part of “the integrated deterrence that the US is building in
      the region.”


      This saddled the Albanese government with significant obligations to the Australian
      people. Be clear, suggests Hastie. Be transparent. “I think we need to talk about
      operationalising the alliance, building guard rails for combat operations, and
      of course defining our sovereignty. And this will make things clearer for us so
      that we can better preserve our national interest.” With admirable clarity, Hastie
      places the Australian security establishment in the dock for interrogation. “We’re
      not just a vassal stage, we’re an ally and a partner and I think it’s time that
      we had a good discussion about what that looks like.”


      Given that Australia already hosts a rotational US Marine force in Darwin from
      April to November, the Pine Gap signal intelligence facility in Alice Springs,
      and, in due course, the Submarine Rotational Force out of Perth from 2027 (“effectively
      a US submarine base”), it was time to consider what would happen if, say, a war
      were to be waged in the Indo Pacific. It was “about time we started to mature
      the [relationship] model and we’re open to the Australian people what it means
      for us”.


      These views are not those of a closet pacifist wishing away the tangles of the
      US imperium. Having spent his pre-political life in the Australian Defence Forces
      as a member of the special services, he knows what it’s like playing valet in
      the battlefield to Washington’s imperial mandarins. Not that he rejects that role.
      Fear of abandonment and Freudian neuroses tend to pattern the Australian outlook
      on defence and national security. Yet there was something comforting in his awareness
      that the American garrisoning of its ally for future geopolitical brawling needed
      explanation and elucidation.


      The response from Australia’s Defence Minister Richard Marles was typical. Spot
      the backbone of such a figure and find it wanting. US intentions and operations
      in Australia, he insisted, were adequately clear. Australians need not be troubled.
      There was, he told reporters during a visit to London to meet his UK counterpart
      John Healey “actually a high degree of transparency in relation to the United
      States presence in Australia.” The Australian government had “long and full knowledge
      and concurrence arrangements in relation to America’s force posture in Australia,
      not just in relation to Pine Gap, but in relation to all of its force posture
      in Australia.” Reiterating another fable of defence orthodoxy, Marles was also
      convinced Australia’s sovereignty in terms of how the US conducted its operations
      had been spared. Given Canberra’s abject surrender to Washington’s whims and interests
      with the AUKUS trilateral pact, this is an unsustainable claim.


      To this day, we have sufficient anecdotal evidence that Pine Gap, notionally a
      jointly run facility between US and Australian personnel, remains indispensable
      to the Pentagon, be it in navigating drones, directing bombing missions and monitoring
      adversaries. The Nautilus Institute, most capably through its senior research
      associate Richard Tanter, has noted the base’s use of geosynchronous signals intelligence
      (SIGINT) satellites, Space-Based Infrared Systems (SBIRS) and its acquisition
      in the early 2000s of a FORNSAT/COMSAT (foreign satellite/communications satellite)
      function.


      This makes Australia complicit in campaigns the United States pursues when it
      chooses. Dr Margaret Beavis, Australian co-chair of the International Campaign
      to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (ICAN), outlined the potential consequences: “We risk
      accelerating nuclear proliferation, we risk Pine Gap becoming a target, Tindal
      airbase becoming a target.”


      All efforts to raise the matter before the vassal representatives in Canberra
      tends to end in a terminating cul-de-sac. Regarding the latest use of US B-2 stealth
      bombers in targeting Iran’s three primary nuclear facilities, the Australian Prime
      Minister, Anthony Albanese, was curt: “We are upfront, but we don’t talk about
      intelligence”. The bombing had been a “unilateral action taken by the United States.”
      Australian candour has its limits.


      There is also no clarity about what the US military places on Australian soil
      when it comes to nuclear weapons or any other fabulous nasties that make killing
      in the name of freedom’s empire so glorious and reassuring. As a signatory to
      the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty (SPNFZ), Australia would be in violation
      of its obligations, with Article 5 obligating each party “to prevent in its territory
      the stationing of any nuclear explosive device.” Yet deploying B-52 bombers at
      the RAAF Tindal base would suggest just that, though not all such bombers are
      adapted to that end.


      The naval gazing toadies in foreign affairs and defence have come up with a nice
      exit from the discussion: such weapons, if they were ever to find themselves on
      US weapons platforms on Australian soil, would only ever be in transit. In a Senate
      estimates hearing in February 2023, Defence Department secretary Greg Moriarty
      blithely observedthat, while the stationing of nuclear weapons was prohibited
      by the treaty, nuclear-armed US bombers could still pay a visit. “Successive Australian
      governments have understood and respected the longstanding US policy of neither
      confirming nor denying the presence of nuclear weapons on particular platforms.”
      It is precisely that sort of deferential piffle we can do without.'
    one_sentence_summary: Andrew Hastie, Australia's opposition minister for home affairs,
      has called for greater transparency and a more mature discussion about Australia's
      military relationship with the United States, emphasizing the need to clarify
      Australia's sovereignty and obligations amidst increasing US military presence
      in the region, while the current government maintains that existing arrangements
      are adequately transparent.

      emphasizing the need for a more mature discussion about the bilateral relationship.
      In an interview, he highlighted the importance of operationalizing the alliance
      and defining Australia's sovereignty, especially in light of the US's military
      activities in the Indo Pacific region. Despite hosting US forces and facilities,
      including the Pine Gap intelligence base, Hastie argues that the Australian government
      must clarify the implications of these arrangements for national security. In
      contrast, Defence Minister Richard Marles downplayed concerns, asserting that
      US operations in Australia are transparent and that the country maintains its
      sovereignty. Critics, including Dr. Margaret Beavis, warn that Australia's involvement
      with US military actions could lead to nuclear proliferation risks and complicity
      in conflicts. The article underscores a growing tension between the need for transparency
      and the Australian government's reluctance to fully disclose the nature of its
      military alliances and obligations.

    url: https://www.counterpunch.org/2025/06/20/shelling-the-aid-seekers-israels-humanitarian-project-in-gaza/
    text: 'It’s official. If not, it ought to be. Israeli forces freely butcher Palestinians
      in Gaza of all stripes, standing and states of desperation. They do so casually
      or indifferently or maliciously. True, they might get the odd militant here and
      there, but the supposedly professional Israeli Defense Forces is rather good at
      killing civilians. In what is becoming an almost daily occurrence, Israeli security
      personnel are slaughtering those seeking humanitarian aid from facilities that
      are obscenely restricted and appallingly located. What is unclear in the process
      is how devastating Palestinian militias armed and supported by the Israelis have
      been in pushing up the mortality count.


      In one incident on June 17, Israeli tanks – not exactly a light form of population
      control – fired into a crown scrounging for aid from trucks in Gaza. The resulting
      death toll was impressively outrageous: 59 killed. A further 14 were also killed
      by IDF gunfire and air strikes in the enclave, taking the death toll for June
      17 to 73. On this occasion, Israel’s normally mendacious publicity arm in the
      IDF seemed to concede that the firing had taken place. It followed that yet another
      cleansing review would take place.


      According to Reuters, a witness by the name of Alaa interviewed at Nasser Hospital
      saw the following spectacle of gore: “All of a sudden, they let us move forward
      and made everyone gather, and then shells started falling, tank shells.”


      The IDF breezily stated that it was “aware of reports regarding a number of injured
      individuals from IDF fire following the crowd’s approach. The details of the incident
      are under view. The IDF regrets any harm to uninvolved individuals and operates
      to minimise harm as much as possible to them while maintaining the safety of our
      troops.”


      The previous day, 34 people awaiting to collect food were killed by IDF personnel
      near an aid centre operated by the Israeli- and US-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation,
      a body whose dubious credentials never cease to amaze. Eyewitnesses in the crowd,
      including Heba Jouda and Mohamed Abed, recall Israeli troops firing on Palestinians
      massed around 4 a.m. at the Flag Roundabout prior to the scheduled opening of
      the Rafah food centre. The roundabout is located some hundreds of metres from
      the GHF centre, and has been the site of numerous shootings. “Fire was coming
      from everywhere,” stated Jouda, a worn figure who has made the harrowing journey
      to the aid centre a number of times. “It’s getting worse by the day.”


      The International Committee on the Red Cross (ICRC) confirmed receiving 200 people
      at its field hospital located in the Al-Mawasi area near Rafah. Up till that point,
      the ICRC stated that it had been “the highest number received by the Red Cross
      Field Hospital in one mass casualty incident.” Carrie Garavan, a British Red Cross
      nurse working at the field hospital, notes the daily flow of casualties into the
      facility, most of whom have been queuing for food. “We are having mass casualty
      incidents almost every day, sometimes twice a day.”


      The GHF, for its part, is lukewarm to the fattening butcher’s bill. None of the
      shooting incidents, claimed a spokesperson to The Associated Press, “have occurred
      at our sites or during operating hours.” Implying that those seeking aid were
      responsible for their own demise, the spokesperson went on to explain that they
      had moved “during prohibited times … or trying to take a shortcut.” How irresponsible
      of them.


      In oral evidence given to the UK Foreign Affairs Committee on June 16, Anna Halford,
      the Médecins Sans Frontières emergency coordinator for Gaza, found it “difficult
      to overstate at what point this is neither a humanitarian enterprise nor a system.”
      The entire Israeli aid effort in Gaza, as things stood, “was basically lethal
      chaos.” Prior to the current lethal order of aid distribution, 400 to 500 community-level
      points were functioning for those seeking food. Kitchens cooking hot meals and
      bakeries supplying bread were plentiful. The numbers currently operating had plummeted
      to four.


      Halford’s picture of what is being provided is grisly. The rations are only of
      the dry variety. There is an absence of clean water and cooking fuel, with no
      cooking gas entering the enclave since March 2. Substitute kerosene has proven
      woefully inadequate, causing those using it burns. Food is cooked on broken wooden
      pallets, salvaged plastic taken from piles of rubbish or turned up cardboard boxes.


      As for the justification given by Israel for the imposition of such onerous, cruel
      restrictions to the provision of aid – the deviation and theft of aid by Hamas
      or allied forces – Halford, speaking on behalf of MSF, was sharp in rebuke. While
      no aid system could ever guarantee against some deviation or theft of supplies,
      Israel had never offered any evidence to back its claims. “It is a strawman; it
      is a specious and cynical position meant to undermine a humanitarian system that
      was actually functioning.” And that is precisely the point of the current, sanguinary
      exercise.'
    one_sentence_summary: The article criticizes the Israeli Defense Forces for their
      indiscriminate killings of Palestinians in Gaza, particularly during humanitarian
      aid distribution, highlighting the severe humanitarian crisis exacerbated by the
      military's actions and the inadequate response from aid organizations.

      of Palestinians, particularly those seeking aid. It details a tragic incident

      resulting in 73 deaths, and another incident the day prior that killed 34 individuals.
      Eyewitness accounts describe chaotic scenes of gunfire and mass casualties, with

      the Red Cross reported record numbers of casualties, while aid organizations criticized
      the dire conditions and inadequate food supplies, attributing the crisis to Israel's
      harsh restrictions on aid distribution. The article emphasizes the lack of evidence
      for Israel's claims regarding aid theft by Hamas and portrays the situation as
      a lethal chaos rather than a humanitarian effort, underscoring the severe impact
      on civilians in Gaza.

    url: https://www.counterpunch.org/2025/06/17/condemning-the-right-to-self-defence-irans-retaliation-and-israels-privilege/
    text: 'There is a throbbing complaint among Western powers, including those in the
      European Union and the United States. Iran is not playing by the rules. Instead
      of accepting with dutiful meekness the slaughter of its military leadership and
      scientific personnel, Tehran decided, promptly, to respond to Israel’s pre-emptive
      strikes launched on June 13. Instead of considering the dubious legal implications
      of such strikes, an act of undeclared war, the focus in the European Union and
      various other backers of Israel has been to focus on the retaliation itself.


      To the Israeli attacks conducted as part of Operation Rising Lion, there was studied
      silence. It was not a silence observed when it came to the invasion of Ukraine
      in February 2022 by Vladimir Putin’s Russia. Then, the law books were swiftly
      procured, and obligations of the United Nations Charter cited under Article 2(4):
      “All members shall refrain from the threat or use of force against the territorial
      integrity of any state.” Russia was condemned for adopting a preventive stance
      on Ukraine as a threat to its security: that, in Kyiv joining NATO, a formidable
      threat would manifest at the border.


      In his statement on the unfolding conflict between Israel and Iran, France’s President
      Emmanuel Macron made sure to condemn “Iran’s ongoing nuclear program”, having
      taken “all appropriate diplomatic measures in response.” Israel also had the “right
      to defend itself and ensure its security”, leaving open the suggestion that it
      might have been justified resorting to Article 51 of the UN Charter. All he could
      offer was a call on “all parties to exercise maximum restraint and to de-escalate.”


      In a most piquant response, Francesca Albanese, UN Special Rapporteur on the Occupied
      Palestinian Territories stated that, “On the day Israel, unprovoked, has attacked
      Iran, killing 80 people, the president of a major European power, finally admits
      that in the Middle East, Israel, and only Israel, has the right to defend itself.”


      The German Foreign Office was even bolder in accusing Iran of having engaged in
      its own selfish measures of self-defence (such unwarranted bravado!), something
      it has always been happy to afford Israel. “We strongly condemn the indiscriminate
      Iranian attack on Israeli territory.” In contrast, the foreign office also felt
      it appropriate to reference the illegal attack on Iran as involving “targeted
      strikes” against its nuclear facilities. Despite Israel having an undeclared nuclear
      weapons stockpile that permanently endangers security in the region, the office
      went on to chastise Iran for having a nuclear program that violated “the Non-Proliferation
      Treaty”, threatening in its nature “to the entire region – especially Israel.”
      Those at fault had been found out.


      The President of the EU Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, could hardly improve
      on that apologia. She revealed that she had been conversing with Israeli President
      Isaac Herzog about the “escalating situation in the Middle East.” She also knew
      her priorities: reiterating Israel’s right to self- defence and refusing to mention
      Iran’s, while tagging on the statement a broader concern for preserving regional
      stability. The rest involved a reference to diplomacy and de-escalation, toward
      which Israel has shown a resolute contempt with regards Iran and its nuclear program.


      The assessment offered by Mohamed ElBaradei, former Director General of the International
      Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), was forensically impressive, as well as being icily
      dismissive. Not only did he reproach the German response for ignoring the importance
      of Article 2(4) of the Charter prohibiting the use of force subject to the right
      to self-defence, he brought up a reminder: targeted strikes against the nuclear
      facilities of any party “are prohibited under Article 56 of the additional protocol
      of the Geneva Conventions to which Germany is a party”.


      ElBaradei also referred anyone exercised by such matters to the United Nations
      Security Council 487 (1981), which did not have a single demur in its adoption.
      It unreservedly condemned the attack by Israel on Iraq’s Osirak nuclear research
      reactor in June that year as a violation of the UN Charter, recognised that Iraq
      was a party to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and
      had permitted the IAEA inspections of the facility, stated that Iraq had a right
      to establish and develop civilian nuclear programs and called on Israel to place
      its own nuclear facilities under the jurisdictional safeguards of the IAEA.


      The calculus regarding the use of force by Israel vis-à-vis its adversaries has
      long been a sneaky one. It is jigged and rigged in favour of the Jewish state.
      As Trita Parsi put it with unblemished accuracy, Western pundits had, for a year
      and a half, stated that Hamas, having started the Gaza War on October 7, 2023
      bore responsibility for civilian carnage. “Western pundits for the past 1.5 days:
      Israel started the war with Iran, and if Iran retaliates, they bear responsibility
      for civilian deaths.” The perceived barbarian, when attacked by a force seen as
      superior and civilised, will always be condemned for having reacted most naturally,
      and most violently of all.'
    one_sentence_summary: The article critiques the Western powers' biased responses
      to the conflict between Israel and Iran, highlighting their condemnation of Iran's
      retaliation while ignoring Israel's preemptive strikes, and underscores the inconsistency
      in international law application regarding self-defense and military actions.
    paragraph_summary: Western powers, particularly the EU and the US, have expressed
      frustration over Iran's response to Israel's pre-emptive military strikes, which
      they view as a violation of international norms. While Israel's actions, part
      of Operation Rising Lion, have gone largely unchallenged, the retaliation from
      Tehran has drawn condemnation. Leaders like French President Emmanuel Macron emphasized
      Israel's right to self-defense while ignoring Iran's claims to the same. Criticism
      has also been directed at the German Foreign Office for labeling Iran's defensive
      measures as "selfish," while downplaying the legality of Israel's strikes on Iranian
      nuclear facilities. Former IAEA Director Mohamed ElBaradei highlighted the inconsistencies
      in these responses, pointing out violations of international law. The broader
      narrative suggests a double standard in how Western powers perceive and respond
      to aggression in the Middle East, with a tendency to excuse Israeli actions while
      condemning Iranian responses.

    text: 'Pre-emptive attacks in international law are rarely justified. The threat
      must evince itself through an obvious intent to inflict injury, evidence preparations
      that show the threat to be what Michael Walzer calls a “supreme emergency”, and
      arise in a situation where risk of defeat would be dramatically increased if force
      is not used.


      Reaching an assessment on that matter is almost impossible. Evidence of such a
      threat by the aggressor state is bound to be speculative, concealing other strategic
      objectives that make that action amount to illegal, preventive war. Israel’s ongoing
      attacks on Iran’s nuclear infrastructure are taking place in the absence of nuclear
      weapons, motivated by the hypothetical scenario that such weapons would be irretrievably
      developed and used against the Jewish state. Iran, in other words, was being punished
      for a thought crime.


      The Israeli Defense Forces released a statement expressing the rationale: “Weapons
      of mass destruction in the hands of the Iranian regime are a threat to the State
      of Israel and a significant threat to the entire world. The State of Israel will
      not allow a regime whose goal is the destruction of the State of Israel to possess
      weapons of mass destruction.”


      There is even a concession on the part of IDF officials that triumphant success
      in the operation is not assured; Israelis needed to brace themselves before the
      inevitable reaction. “I can’t promise absolute success,” declared Lieutenant General
      Eyal Zamir. Tehran “will attempt to attack us in response, the expected toll will
      be different to what we are used to.”


      The Defence Minister Israel Katz offers some wishful thinking in justifying the
      attack. “We are now at a critical juncture. If we miss it, we will have no way
      to stop Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons that will endanger our very own existence.”
      Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu preferred lashings of hyperbole. “If we don’t
      attack, then it’s 100% that we will die,” he declared in a video statement to
      the nation.


      This is the language of self-denial, both on the issue of preventing Iran from
      acquiring a nuclear option indefinitely – an unsustainable policy in the absence
      of peaceful dissuasion – and the belief that such operations will result in some
      form of contained, well-behaved retaliation. With typical perversity, these attacks
      are taking place in step with demands by US President Donald Trump that Tehran
      resort to meek diplomacy, an effort that is bound to have been extinguished by
      these attacks.


      And what of the threat posed by Iran? In March this year, the US Director of National
      Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard told the Senate Intelligence Committee that the assessment
      was “that Iran is not building a nuclear weapon and Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali
      Khamenei has not authorized the nuclear weapons program he suspended in 2003.”
      But Netanyahu had already given a directive in November 2024 to thwart alleged
      efforts by Tehran to build a nuclear device. “The directive,” he confirms, “came
      shortly after the assassination of [Hezbollah leader Hassan] Nasrallah”.


      The broader Israeli logic here is less the coherence of the nuclear threat than
      one of settling scores and crippling a rival it has long accused of directing
      operations against its interests, if not directly than through its proxy militias.


      As for the logic of non-acquisition, not much can be made of it. The advent of
      the Colt 45 revolver in the late 1800s arguably calmed the American West by granting
      those with less power and influence a means of asserting their will against the
      powerful and landed. It became “the Peacemaker”, sometimes described as “the Great
      Equalizer.” As part of that same logic, the late international relations theorist
      Kenneth N. Waltz proposed that nuclear weapons made war less likely, believing
      that “the gradual spread of nuclear weapons is to be more welcomed than feared.”
      He even went so far as to argue in 2012 that Iran’s acquisition of nuclear weapons
      would “most likely […] restore stability to the Middle East.” It was Israel’s
      durable nuclear monopoly in the Middle East that “long fueled instability” in
      the region.


      The invention of nuclear weaponry was a statement of intent that possessing such
      a weapon would be akin to acquiring the shielding protection of a patron deity.
      This is a lesson the Israelis should know better than most, having themselves
      stealthily acquired an undeclared nuclear inventory. To not have it would weaken
      you, diminish international standing, making the non-possessor vulnerable to attack.


      North Korea learned this salutary lesson, motivated by two supreme examples: the
      illegal invasion of Iraq in 2003 by the US-led “Coalition of the Willing”, and
      the collective attack on Libya in 2011, ostensibly under the doctrine of responsibility
      to protect. The disarmament efforts made by Saddam Hussein’s Iraq and Muammar
      Gaddafi’s Libya rendered them vulnerable to attack. Lacking a terrifying deterrent,
      they were contemptuously rolled.


      Attempts to control proliferation have been imperfect, largely because the nuclear
      option has never been entirely demystified. Despite the admirable strides made
      in international law to stigmatise nuclear weapons, best reflected in the Treaty
      on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, not to mention the tireless labours of
      the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons, the nuclear weapons club
      remains a permanent provocation and incitement to non-nuclear weapons states.
      It is the red rag to the bull.


      These attacks will do little to weaken the resolve of the mullahs in Teheran.
      They are roguish undertakings, murderous in their scope (the killing of scientists
      and their families stands out), and sneering of international law. Netanyahu’s
      absurd lecturing to the Iranian populace – we are bombing you to free you – will
      fall flat. Most consequential will be confirmation on the part of the Islamic
      State that acquiring a nuclear weapon is more imperative than ever.'
    one_sentence_summary: The article argues that Israel's pre-emptive attacks on Iran's
      nuclear infrastructure are unjustified under international law, as they are based
      on speculative threats rather than clear evidence of imminent danger, and such
      actions may ultimately reinforce Iran's resolve to pursue nuclear weapons rather
      than diminish it.
    paragraph_summary: The article discusses the contentious issue of pre-emptive attacks
      in international law, arguing that such actions are rarely justified unless there
      is clear evidence of an imminent threat. It critiques Israel's ongoing military
      operations against Iran's nuclear infrastructure, which are based on speculative
      fears of a future nuclear threat rather than concrete evidence, labeling these
      actions as illegal preventive warfare. Israeli officials, including Prime Minister
      Netanyahu, express dire warnings about the necessity of these strikes to prevent
      existential threats, yet the article suggests that such rhetoric reflects a denial
      of the complexities of the situation and a failure to recognize the potential
      for escalation. The piece also highlights the broader implications of nuclear
      proliferation, noting that attempts to control it have often failed, and that
      aggressive actions may reinforce Iran's resolve to pursue nuclear capabilities.
      Ultimately, it argues that these military operations are unlikely to achieve their
      intended goals and may instead provoke further instability in the region.

    url: https://www.counterpunch.org/2025/06/13/the-morality-of-small-means-sanctioning-israels-ministers/
    text: 'They really ought to be doing more. But in the scheme of things, the sanctioning
      of Israeli’s frothily fanatical ministers Itamar Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich
      by New Zealand, Canada, Norway, the United Kingdom and Australia is a reminder
      to the Israeli government that ethnic cleansing, mass killing and the destruction
      of a people will receive some comment. But a closer look at the trumpeted move
      does little to suggest anything in the way of change or deterrence, certainly
      not in Gaza, where the cataclysm continues without restraint.


      According to the joint statement, both politicians “have incited extremist violence
      and serious abuses of Palestinian human rights. Extremist rhetoric advocating
      the forced displacement of Palestinians and the creation of new Israeli settlements
      is appalling and dangerous.” The violence by Israeli settlers in the West Bank
      had “led to the deaths of Palestinian civilians and the displacement of whole
      communities.”


      The reasoning for the imposition of such sanctions tends to minimise Ben-Gvir
      and Smotrich’s zealous defence of programmatic and systematic displacement and
      removal of Palestinian existence in the Strip, despite the statement claiming
      that “this cannot be seen in isolation”. The statement fails to note the warnings
      from the International Court of Justice that Palestinians in Gaza face the risk
      of genocide, with a final decision pending on the matter.


      Singling out individual members of the Netanyahu cabinet as the convenient lunatics
      and the devilishly possessed is a point of convenience rather than effect. It
      is true that, even by certain Israeli standards, a figure like Ben-Gvir is a bit
      too pungent, a convict of racist incitement, the procurer of assault rifles to
      West Bank settlers and an advocate for the full annexation of the territory. But
      identifying the villainous monsters conceals the broader villainous effort, and
      the Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong did as much in simply calling the two
      ministers “the most extreme proponents of the unlawful and violent Israeli settlement
      enterprise.”


      The report of the UN Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Occupied
      Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, and Israel, prefers to note the
      broader role played by such agents of power as the Israeli security forces, which
      it accuses of committing war crimes in directing attacks against the civilian
      population in Gaza, wilful killing and intentionally launching attacks that “would
      cause incidental loss of life or injury to civilians”. Killing civilians seeking
      shelter in schools also implicated the forces “in the crime against humanity of
      extermination.” The canvas of responsibility, in other words, is panoramic and
      large.


      Pity, then, that the latest expression of small means by these five powers does
      not extend to a complete halt to military cooperation, the selling of arms, or
      engagement across various fields of industry. That would have diminished the hypocrisy
      somewhat, something that the countries in question are unlikely to do. More’s
      the pity that the Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has been spared
      this fit of moral clarity. When considered in substance, the two ministers face
      the sorts of restrictions that will be mildly bruising at best: travel bans and
      the freezing of assets.


      The move by the Australian Labor government and its counterparts was, in the broader
      scheme of things, a modest one. It was also worth remembering that Canberra’s
      decision was made in sheepish fashion, with Wong previously stating that Australia
      would never unilaterally make such a move, as “going it alone gets us nowhere”.
      It was seen by Greens Senator Nick McKim as “far too little and far too late”.
      Sanctions were needed against the “Israeli industrial war machine.” On the other
      hand, Alex Ryvchin, co-chief of the Executive Council of Australian Jewry suggests
      that these measures can become a martyr’s tonic. “They have little support in
      Israel, but this is the sort of measure that will boost their notoriety and make
      them perhaps more popular”.


      Looking ever the marionette in the show, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio flapped
      about in condemning the sanctions, which “do not advance US-led efforts to achieve
      a ceasefire, bring all hostages home and end the war.” Bereft of skills in argumentation,
      he could only warn US allies “not to forget who the real enemy is.”


      The sanctions seemed to cause the condemned two less grief than Israeli Foreign
      Minister Gideon Sa’ar, who derided the decision as “outrageous”, “scandalous”
      and “unacceptable.” It was all part of “a planned and coordinated pressure campaign.”
      Ben-Gvir was almost smug with the attention and bursting with semitic pride. “We
      survived Pharoah, we will also survive [British Prime Minister] Keir Starmer,”
      he tooted in a statement.


      Smotrich even seemed thrilled by the timing of it all, having been at the inauguration
      of a new Jewish settlement near the West Bank city of Hebron when he heard the
      news. “I heard Britain had decided to impose sanctions on me because I am thwarting
      the establishment of a Palestinian state,” he boasted. “There couldn’t be a better
      moment for this.”


      One point is certainly true: the selective moves against the dastardly two leaves
      the murderous apparatus intact, and the IDF war machine undiminished. Most of
      all, it will do nothing to halt the construction of a single settlement or save
      a single Palestinian from dispossession.'
    one_sentence_summary: The recent sanctions imposed by New Zealand, Canada, Norway,
      the UK, and Australia on Israeli ministers Itamar Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich
      highlight their extremist actions against Palestinians, yet these measures are
      largely symbolic and fail to address the broader systemic violence and human rights
      abuses perpetrated by the Israeli government.
    paragraph_summary: The recent sanctions imposed by New Zealand, Canada, Norway,
      the UK, and Australia on Israeli ministers Itamar Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich,
      known for their extremist views and actions against Palestinians, serve as a symbolic
      gesture rather than a substantial change in policy or deterrence, particularly
      in the ongoing violence in Gaza. While the joint statement condemns their incitement
      of violence and human rights abuses, it fails to address the broader context of
      Israeli actions and the warnings from the International Court of Justice regarding
      the risk of genocide for Palestinians. Critics argue that the sanctions are insufficient
      and highlight the hypocrisy of not halting military cooperation or arms sales
      with Israel, which would have had a more meaningful impact. The ministers themselves
      appear unfazed, with Ben-Gvir and Smotrich expressing pride and defiance in response
      to the sanctions. Ultimately, these measures do little to alter the status quo
      or protect Palestinian rights, leaving the larger Israeli military apparatus intact.

    url: https://www.counterpunch.org/2025/06/09/bad-old-habits-israel-backs-palestinian-militias-in-gaza/
    text: 'It is one of those things that should be recorded and replayed for eternity:
      Israel, in order to guard some misplaced sense of security, happily backs Palestinian
      groups in order to divide themselves. Hamas, seen now as an existential monster,
      was tolerated and even supported for lengthy stints in efforts to undermine the
      various factions in the Palestinian Liberation Organisation represented by Fatah.


      In his 2008 work, Hamas vs. Fatah, Jonathan Schanzer, writes how the Egyptian
      Muslim Brotherhood, the inspirational font for Hamas, was seen as an opportunity
      by the Israelis when taking root in Gaza. “By the late 1970s, the Israelis believed
      that they had found Fatah’s Achilles’ heel.” Israeli strategy permitted the Brotherhood
      to thrive, going so far as to allow the cleric Sheikh Ahmed Yassin to operate
      a network of welfare, medical and education services. These had been sorely neglected
      by Fatah in the Gaza Strip. This approach effectively licensed the emergence of
      fundamentalism, seen, curiously enough, as more manageable than the military adventurism
      of the PLO.


      The First Intifada in 1987 spurred on the creation by Yassin and his followers
      of Harakat al-Muqawama al-Islamiya (“Islamic Resistance Movement”). The 1988 charter
      of the organisation we know as Hamas, more youthful, and leaner, and hungrier
      than their Fatah rivals, made its purpose clear: “There is no solution for the
      Palestinian question except through jihad”.


      In 2009, while surveying the ruins of a neighbour’s bungalow in Moshav Tekuma,
      the retired Israeli officer Avner Cohen, who had served in Gaza for over two decades,
      was rueful. “Hamas, to my regret,” he told the Wall Street Journal, “is Israel’s
      creation.” Sustenance and encouragement from the Jewish state had effectively
      emboldened a mortal enemy.


      Such a record should chasten wise legislators and leaders. But the only lesson
      history teaches is that its grave lessons are left unlearned, with disastrous,
      inimical mistakes made anew. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is proof
      of that contention. His various governments proudly backed the policy of division
      between the Gaza Strip and West Bank, defanging Palestinian Authority President
      Mahmoud Abbas in the latter while propping up Hamas in the former. Every now and
      then, the Israeli Defense Forces would keep Hamas in bloody check, a strategy
      that came to be called “mowing the grass”.


      Israel’s support for Hamas has come in the form of work permits (up to 3,000 granted
      to Gazans in 2021, rising to 10,000 during the Bennett-Lapid government), and
      suitcases, heavy with Qatari cash, entering the Strip through crossings since
      2018. In 2019, Netanyahu was quoted as telling a Likud faction meeting that opponents
      of a Palestinian state should support the transfer of funds to Hamas. Five years
      prior, Bezalel Smotrich, the current firebrand, pro-ethnic cleansing Finance Minister,
      declared with candour that “The Palestinian Authority is a burden, and Hamas is
      an asset.”


      With Hamas now the target and sworn enemy, the PM feels that the same, failed
      experiment adopted at stages since the 1970s can be replicated: backing and encouraging
      yet another group of Palestinians to undermine any sovereign cause.


      The central figure and beneficiary of this latest folly is the shady Yasser Abu
      Shabab, a Rafah resident from a Bedouin family known for a spotty criminal record.
      Calling itself the “Anti-Terror Service” or the Popular Forces, and possessing
      assault rifles and equipment seized from Hamas, his “clan”, as reports have described
      it, has a committed record of looting humanitarian aid in Gaza. In Netanyahu’s
      eyes, these rapacious poachers have turned into opportunistic game keepers, partially
      guarding the paltry aid that is currently being sent into Gaza under the supervision
      of the Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation.


      Georgios Petropoulos, a senior United Nations official based in Gaza last year,
      calls Abu Shabab “the self-styled power broker of east Rafah.” For his part, Abu
      Shabab admits to looting aid trucks, but only “so we can eat, not so we can sell.”
      The looting proclivities of such groups is well noted, with the head of the UN
      office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs in occupied Palestinian territories,
      Jonathan Whittall, making a damning accusation on May 28: “The real theft of aid
      since the beginning of the war has been carried out by criminal gangs, under the
      watch of Israeli forces, and they were allowed to operate in proximity to the
      Kerem Shalom crossing point in Gaza.”


      On May 21, Abu Shabab’s group posted on Facebook that “92 trucks were secured
      and entered areas under the protection of our popular forces, and exited safely
      under our supervision.” Details on which organisation was behind hiring the transporting
      vehicles were not given.


      With rumours bubbling that the Israeli government had embarked on this latest
      course of action, Netanyahu came clean. “On the advice of security officials,
      we activated clans in Gaza that oppose Hamas,” he announced in a posted video
      with usual, glowing cynicism. “What’s wrong with that?” The strategy “only saves
      the lives of Israeli soldiers and publicising this only benefits Hamas.”


      The advice purportedly given by Shin Bet to Netanyahu to arm Gaza militias opposed
      to Hamas was an expedient measure, largely occasioned by the PM’s continued refusal
      to involve the Palestinian Authority in the strip.


      Not all Israeli lawmakers were impressed by Netanyahu’s latest effort at supposed
      cleverness. Yair Golan, leader of the Democrats in the Knesset, condemned him
      as a threat to Israeli security. “Instead of bringing about a deal, making arrangements
      with the moderate Sunni axis, and returning the hostages and security of Israeli
      citizens, he is creating a new ticking bomb in Gaza.”


      The leader of the Yisrael Beiteinu party, Avigdor Lieberman, is of the view that
      the transfer of weapons to Abu Shabab’s outfit was done unilaterally. “The Israeli
      government is giving weapons to a group of criminals and felons, identified with
      the Islamic State group,” he told the public broadcaster Kan. “To my knowledge,
      this did not go through approval by the cabinet.”


      With humanitarian aid now at the mercy of a group scorned by UN officials, humanitarian
      workers and certain Israeli politicians – a rare coming together of minds – the
      next round of errors is playing out with rich, quixotic stupidity. Israel further
      adds to its own insecurity, while Abu Shabab knows all too well the views of his
      family, expressed in chilling statement: “We affirm that we will not accept Yasser’s
      return to the family. We have no objection to those around him liquidating him
      immediately, and we tell you that his blood is forfeit.”'
    one_sentence_summary: The article critiques Israel's historical and ongoing strategy
      of supporting Palestinian groups like Hamas to undermine the Palestinian Authority,
      highlighting the dangerous consequences of this policy as it leads to the empowerment

    paragraph_summary: The article discusses Israel's historical and ongoing support
      for Palestinian groups, particularly Hamas, as a strategy to weaken the Palestinian
      Liberation Organization (PLO) and maintain control over the region. Initially,
      Israel tolerated and even supported Hamas to counter Fatah, believing it to be
      a more manageable alternative to the PLO. This strategy has evolved, with Israeli
      Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu recently backing new factions in Gaza, such
      as the "Anti-Terror Service" led by Yasser Abu Shabab, to undermine Hamas. Critics,
      including Israeli lawmakers, express concern that this approach is reckless and
      could exacerbate security issues, as these groups are often involved in criminal
      activities, including looting humanitarian aid. The article highlights the cyclical
      nature of these strategies, suggesting that Israel's attempts to manipulate Palestinian
      factions continue to lead to unintended consequences and increased instability.

    url: https://www.counterpunch.org/2025/06/05/off-to-war-we-go-starmers-strategic-defence-review/
    text: '


      Unpopular governments always retreat to grounds of lazy convenience. Instead of
      engaging in exercises of courage, they take refuge in obvious distractions. And
      there is no more obvious distraction than preparing for war against a phantom
      enemy.


      That is exactly where the government of Sir Keir Starmer finds itself. Despite
      a mammoth majority and a dramatically diminished Tory opposition, the Prime Minister
      acts like a man permanently besieged, his Labour Party seemingly less popular
      than Typhoid Mary. His inability to be unequivocal to questions of whether he
      will contest the next election suggest as much.


      The same cannot be said about his enthusiasm for the sword and sabre. There are
      monsters out there to battle, and Sir Keir is rising to the plate. Sensing this,
      the military mandarins, most prominently General Sir Roland Walker, head of the
      Army, have been more than encouraging, seeing the need to ready the country for
      war by 2027. Given the military’s perennial love affair with astrology, that state
      of readiness could only be achieved with a doubling of the Army’s fighting power
      and tripling it by 2030.


      Given that background, the UK Strategic Defence Review (SDR) was commissioned
      in July 2024. Led by former Labour Defence Secretary and NATO Secretary General
      Lord George Robertson, the freshly released report promises a fat boon for the
      military industrial complex. Like all efforts to encourage war, its narrative
      is that of supposedly making Britain safer.


      Starmer’s introduction is almost grateful for the chance to out the blood lusting
      enemy. “In this new era for defence and security, when Russia is waging war on
      our continent and probing our defences at home, we must meet the danger head on.”
      The placing of noble Ukraine into the warming fraternity of Europe enables a civilisational
      twist to be made. The Russian military efforts in Ukraine are not specific to
      a murderous family affair and historical anxieties but directed against all Europeans.
      Therefore, all Europeans should militarise and join the ranks, acknowledging that
      “the very nature of warfare is being transformed” by that conflict.


      In pursuing the guns over butter program, Starmer recapitulates the sad theme
      of previous eras that led to global conflict. As Europe began rearming in the
      1930s, a prevalent argument was that people could have guns and butter. Greater
      inventories of weaponry would encourage greater prosperity. So, we find Starmer
      urging the forging of deeper ties between government and industry and “a radical
      reform of procurement”, one that could only be economically beneficial. This would
      be the “defence dividend”, another nonsense term the military industrial complex
      churns out with such disconcerting ease.


      The foreword from the Defence Secretary, John Healey, outlines the objectives
      of the SDR. These include playing a leading role in NATO “with strengthened nuclear,
      new tech, and updated conventional capabilities”; moving the country to a state
      of “warfighting readiness”; nourishing the insatiable military industrial Moloch;
      learning the lessons of Ukraine (“harnessing drones, data and digital warfare”);
      and adopting a “whole-of-society approach”, a sly if clumsy way of enlisting the
      civilian populace into the military enterprise.


      The review makes 62 recommendations, all accepted by the grateful government.
      Some £15 billion will go to the warhead programme, supporting 9,000 jobs, while
      £6 billion will be spent on munitions over the course of the current Parliament.
      A “New Hybrid Navy” is envisaged, one that will feature Dreadnought and the yet
      to be realised SSN-AUKUS submarines, alongside “support ships” and “autonomous
      vessels to patrol the North Atlantic and beyond.” Submarine production is given
      the most optimistic assessment: one completion every 18 months.


      The Royal Air Force is not to miss out, with more F-35s, modernised Typhoons,
      and the next generation of jets acquired through the Global Combat Air Programme.
      To his splurge will be added autonomous fighters, enabling global reach.


      Mindless assessments are abundant in the Review. The government promises a British
      army 10 times “more lethal to deter from the land, by combining more people and
      armoured capability with air defence, communications, AI, software, long-range
      weapons, and land drone swarms.” Some 7,000 new long-range weapons will be built
      and a New CyberEM Command established “to defend Britain from daily attacks in
      the grey zone.” Keeping those merchants of death happy will be a new Defence Exports
      Office located in the Ministry of Defence, one intended “to drive exports to our
      allies and growth at home.”


      The fanfare of the report, festooned with fripperies for war, conceals the critical
      problems facing the British armed forces. The ranks are looking increasingly thinned.
      (In 2010, regular troop numbers stood at 110,000; the current target of 73,000
      soldiers is being barely met.) Morale is ebbing. The state of equipment is embarrassingly
      poor. The UK’s celebrated submarine deterrent is somewhat less formidable in the
      deterrence department, with its personnel exhausted and subject to unpardonably
      lengthy stints at sea. The 204-day patrol by HMS Vanguard is a case in point.


      Whether the SDR’s recommendations ever fructify remains the hovering question.
      It’s all very good to make promises about weapons programmes and boosting a country’s
      readiness to kill, but militaries can be tardy in delivery and faulty in execution.
      What saves the day may well be standard ineptitude rather than any firebrand conviction
      in war. To the unready go the spoils.'
    one_sentence_summary: The article critiques Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's government
      for diverting attention from its unpopularity by ramping up military preparations
      and promoting a defense strategy that emphasizes war readiness and military-industrial
      ties, despite significant challenges within the British armed forces.
    paragraph_summary: The article critiques the UK government's approach under Prime
      Minister Sir Keir Starmer, suggesting that it is retreating into militaristic
      rhetoric as a distraction from its unpopularity and internal issues. Despite holding
      a significant parliamentary majority, Starmer's Labour Party appears to lack public
      support, prompting a focus on military readiness and defense against perceived
      threats, particularly from Russia. The recently commissioned UK Strategic Defence
      Review (SDR), led by Lord George Robertson, proposes substantial increases in
      military spending and capabilities, including a £15 billion investment in warheads
      and plans for a "New Hybrid Navy." However, the article highlights critical shortcomings
      within the British armed forces, such as dwindling troop numbers, low morale,
      and inadequate equipment, questioning whether the ambitious SDR recommendations
      will be effectively implemented. Ultimately, it suggests that the government's
      militaristic focus may be more about maintaining power than genuinely addressing
      national security needs.

    url: https://www.counterpunch.org/2025/06/04/thieves-in-the-kitchen-the-stealing-of-recipes/
    text: 'Recipe author Nagi Maehashi, unmoved by her own numbing banality, is peeved.
      Her target: Penguin books and author Brooke Bellamy. Her accusation: the apparent
      copying of recipes for caramel slice and baklava from Maehashi’s RecipeTin Eats
      website, released in Bellamy’s Bake with Brooki, published in October last year.
      “Profiting from plagiarised recipes is unethical,” she huffed, “even if it is
      not copyright infringement – and undermines the integrity of the entire book.”
      Rather indulgently, Maehashi goes on to decry this as a “slap in the face to every
      author who puts in the hard work to create original content rather than cutting
      corners.” The question left begging is whether this is ever possible for a cookbook.


      Bellamy, who has the combined weight of 3 million followers on TikTok and Instagram,
      has flatly denied the accusation. “I did not plagiarise any recipes in my book
      which consists of 100 recipes I have created over many years,” she claims on Instagram.
      “In 2016, I opened my first bakery. I have been creating my recipes and selling
      them commercially since October 2016.” The social media figure is candid in admitting
      that she did not invent any of the recipes listed in her book dealing with cookies,
      cupcakes, brownies or cakes.


      On the issue of the caramel slice, Bellamy merely observes that the RecipeTin
      Eats recipe, published in March 2020, “uses the same ingredients as my recipe,
      which I have been making and selling since four years prior.” Evidently not a
      pugilist, Bellamy has even offered to remove the caramel slice and baklava recipes
      from any future reprints of her book, a point “communicated to Nagi swiftly through
      discussions”.


      Another author from cookbook land, Adam Liaw, abandons his kitchen implements
      briefly to explain the finer points of intellectual property in light of this
      dispute. As an intellectual property lawyer in his previous non-cooking life,
      he suggests that the copyright “doesn’t protect the recipe itself. It protects
      the publication of the exact same written form of that recipe. None of the recipes
      written in the world would reach the standards necessary to obtain patent protection.”


      A closer look at the claim is one of plagiarism. This is an interesting point,
      given the multitude of borrowings, replications and, along the way, adjustments,
      that come along with the use of recipes. Professor John Swinson from the University
      of Queensland adds insult to injury to Maehashi’s case by simply stating that
      the steps involved in making the recipe were “not very expressive”. When looking
      at a comparison between the two recipes in question, one is left with a similar
      impression. “You can’t protect a cake or cookie,” Swinson clarifies. “You can
      only protect how it\s expressed, not the end result, and most recipes are just
      factual instructions”.


      A sticking point here is the issue of attribution. Under the Australian Copyright
      Act 1968 (Cth), there are various described moral rights, as distinct from economic
      rights. These include the right of attribution (that the author be identified
      and named as the author of that work); the right against false attribution (the
      right of the author to prevent someone else from being credited as the author
      of their work; and the right of integrity (the right of an author to ensure that
      the work is not subjected to derogatory treatment harmful to the author’s honour
      or reputation).


      Historically speaking, the publication of recipes drawn from the vast archive
      of cookery is more than standard. We find Isabella Beeton in October 1861, a co-editor
      of the Englishwoman’s Domestic Magazine pillaging at will any number of recipes
      for The Book of Household Management. As food boffin and author Helana Brigman
      points out, this book of revelation for Victorian readers, one that allayed fears
      about “how much should a family of five spend on groceries”, had nothing that
      was her own. In writing her book, Beeton made generous use of readers’ submissions.


      The fact remains that, however murky one might assume the laws on copyright were
      on the subject, neither US nor British copyright laws (ditto Australia’s equivalent)
      protect a listing of ingredients, even those found in formulas, compounds, or
      prescriptions. Broadly speaking, claiming some ownership over a dish is much like
      asserting control over the air and its vapours.


      An iconoclastic Jonathan Meades takes the torch to such proprietary assertions
      in his The Plagiarist in the Kitchen: A Lifetime of Culinary Thefts. His work
      eschews “culinary originality”, being an “anti-cookbook” favouring “the daylight
      robbery of recipes, to hijacking techniques and methods, to the notion that in
      the kitchen there is nothing new and nor can there be anything new.”


      Meades rightly notes that the pathology of originality arises from the emergence
      of the cult chef, the God creator in the kitchen. In an interview, he notes how
      it began “in upscale restaurants in Spain and then in Britain with Heston Blumenthal.”


      The entire grievance on Maehashi’s part has given Bellamy even more oxygen for
      her enterprise, with the latter preferring to repair back to the bakery. Two new
      stores are set to open in Queensland in July. An international pop-up store in
      the United Arab Emirates is planned to open by the end of the year, adding to
      existing ones in the Middle East. If Bellamy was ever a thief in the kitchen,
      the enterprise is doing quite nicely.'
    one_sentence_summary: Recipe author Nagi Maehashi has accused Brooke Bellamy of
      plagiarizing her caramel slice and baklava recipes in Bellamy's cookbook, but
      Bellamy denies the allegations, claiming her recipes are original and offering
      to remove the contested ones from future editions, while discussions around copyright
      and recipe originality highlight the complexities of culinary authorship.
    paragraph_summary: Recipe author Nagi Maehashi has accused Penguin Books and author
      Brooke Bellamy of plagiarizing her recipes for caramel slice and baklava from
      her RecipeTin Eats website, which were included in Bellamy's book, Bake with Brooki.
      Maehashi argues that profiting from copied recipes is unethical and undermines
      the integrity of original content, while Bellamy denies the allegations, claiming
      her recipes are original creations developed over years, although she acknowledges
      not inventing the recipes themselves. Bellamy has offered to remove the disputed
      recipes from future editions of her book. Legal experts highlight that copyright
      laws do not protect recipes themselves, only their specific written expressions,
      and the issue of attribution under Australian law complicates the matter further.
      The article also discusses the historical context of recipe sharing and the notion
      of culinary originality, suggesting that the debate over recipe ownership is complex
      and often subjective. Meanwhile, Bellamy continues to expand her bakery business
      despite the controversy.

    url: https://www.counterpunch.org/2025/05/30/roads-to-war-the-eus-security-action-for-europe-fund/
    text: 'As the world was readying for the Second World War, the insightful humane
      Austrian author Stefan Zweig made the following glum observation: “Openly and
      flagrantly, certain countries express their will to expand and make preparations
      for war. The politics of rearmament is pursued in broad daylight and at breakneck
      speed; every day you read in the papers arguments in favour of armaments expansion,
      the idea that it reduces unemployment and provides a boost to the stock exchange.”


      This is not so different from the approval by European Union countries on May
      27 of a €150 billion loan program known as the Security Action for Europe (SAFE)
      borrowing scheme. A press release from the European Council stated that the scheme
      “will finance urgent and large-scale investments in the European defence technological
      and industrial base (EDTIB)” with the intention of boosting “production capacity,
      making sure defence equipment is available when needed, and to address existing
      capability gaps – ultimately strengthening the EU’s overall defence readiness.”


      The statement also makes a central rationale clear: that SAFE will enable continued
      European support for Ukraine, linking its defence industry to the program. Despite
      not being an EU member, Kyiv will be able to participate in the scheme. Interestingly
      enough, the United Kingdom, despite leaving the EU, will also be able to participate
      via a separate agreement.


      Disbursements to interested member states upon demand, considered along national
      plans “will take the form of competitively priced long-maturity loans, to be repaid
      by the beneficiary member states.”


      The scheme further anticipates the types of weaponry, euphemistically titled “defence
      products”, that will feature. As outlined by the European Council on March 6,
      these will comprise two categories: the first covering, amongst others, such products
      as ammunition and missiles, artillery systems, ground combat capabilities with
      support systems; the second, air and missile defence systems, maritime surface
      and underwater capabilities, drones and anti-drone systems and “strategic enablers”
      including air-to-air refuelling, artificial intelligence and electronic warfare.


      The broader militarisation agenda is confirmed by linking SAFE with broader transatlantic
      engagement and “complementarity with NATO.” It will “strive to enhance interoperability,
      continue industrial cooperation, and ensure reciprocal access to state-of-the-art
      technologies with trusted partners.” Significantly, the emphasis is on collaboration:
      a minimum of three countries must combine when requesting funding for SAFE defence
      projects.


      There seems to be something for everyone: the militarist, the war monger and the
      merchants of death. Global Finance, a publication dedicated to informing “corporate
      financial professionals”, was already praising the SAFE proposal in April. “The
      initiative has the potential to transform the business models of many top European
      defense groups – like Saab, which has traditionally relied on contracts from the
      Swedish state to grow its sales.” What a delight it will be for such defence companies
      to move beyond the constraints on sales imposed by their limiting governments.
      A veritable European market of death machinery is in the offing.


      The fund is intended for one, unambiguous purpose: war. The weasel word “defence”
      is merely the code, the cipher. Break it, and it spells out aggression and conflict,
      a hankering for the next great military confrontation. The reason is traditional,
      historic and irrational: the Oriental despotic eminence arising from the Asian
      steppes, people supposedly untutored in the niceties of European good manners
      and democracy. Not that European manners and democracy is in splendid health.
      A mere glance at some of the candidates suggests decline in institutional credibility
      and scepticism. But we can always blame the Russians for that, deviously sowing
      doubt with their disinformation schemes.


      The initiative, and its tightening of ties with arming Ukraine, has made such
      critics as Hungary’s Prime Minister Viktor Orbán sound modestly sensible. “We
      need to invest in our own armies, but they expect us to fund Ukraine’s – with
      billions, for years to come,” he declared in a post on X. “We’ve made it clear:
      Hungary will not pay. Our duty is to protect our own people.”


      The approval of the fund by the European Commission has also angered some members
      of the European Parliament, an institution which has been treated with near contempt
      by the European Commission. European Parliament Presidente Roberta Metsola warned
      Commission President Ursula von der Leyen earlier in May to reconsider the use
      of Article 122 of the EU Treaty, which should be used sparingly in emergencies
      in speeding up approvals with minimal parliamentary scrutiny. Bypassing Europe’s
      invigilating lawmakers risked “undermining democratic legitimacy by weakening
      Parliament’s legislative and scrutiny functions”. The Council’s resort to Article
      122 potentially enlivened a process that could see a legal case taken to the European
      Court of Justice.


      The European Parliament’s Legal Affairs Committee (JURI) has also supported a
      legal opinion repudiating the Commission’s cavalier approach in approving the
      fund. According to that tartly reasoned view, Article 122 was an inappropriate
      justification, as the threshold for evoking emergency powers had simply not been
      met.


      Ironically, the rearmament surge is taking place on both sides of the Atlantic,
      at both the behest of the Trump administration, ever aggrieved by Europe not pulling
      its military weight, and Moscow, characterised and caricatured as a potential
      invader, the catalyst for decorating a continent with bristling weaponry. The
      former continues to play hide and seek with Brussels while still being very much
      in Europe, be it in terms of permanent garrisons and military assets; the latter
      remains a convenient excuse to cross the palms of the military industrial establishment
      with silver. How Zweig would have hated it.'
    one_sentence_summary: The European Union's recent approval of a €150 billion loan
      program for defense investments, aimed at enhancing military readiness and supporting
      Ukraine, reflects a troubling trend of militarization reminiscent of pre-World
      War II sentiments, raising concerns about democratic legitimacy and the implications
      of increased armament in Europe.
    paragraph_summary: As the world approached the Second World War, Austrian author
      Stefan Zweig lamented the overt militarization and rearmament of nations, a sentiment
      echoed today with the European Union's recent approval of a €150 billion loan
      program called the Security Action for Europe (SAFE). This initiative aims to
      bolster the European defense technological and industrial base, enhance production
      capacity, and support Ukraine's defense industry, despite its non-EU status. The
      program, which emphasizes collaboration among member states for funding requests,
      has drawn criticism from figures like Hungary’s Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, who
      argues that funds should prioritize national defense over supporting Ukraine.
      Additionally, the European Parliament has expressed concern over the Commission's
      use of emergency powers to expedite the fund's approval, fearing it undermines
      democratic legitimacy. The article suggests that this rearmament trend, fueled
      by geopolitical tensions and the influence of military industries, reflects a
      troubling cycle of aggression and conflict reminiscent of historical patterns
      that Zweig would have disapproved of.

    url: https://www.counterpunch.org/2025/05/29/squabbling-siblings-india-pakistan-and-operation-sindoor/
    text: 'On April 22, militants from The Resistance Front (TRF), a group accused by
      Indian authorities of being linked to the Lashkar-e-Taiba terrorist group, slaughtered
      26 tourists in the resort town of Pahalgam in the Indian administered portion
      of Kashmir. This came as a rude shock to the Indian military establishment, who
      decided that rebellious sentiments in the region had declined. (In March 2025,
      an assessment concluded that a mere 77 active militants were busying themselves
      on India’s side of the border.)


      The feeling of cooling tensions induced an air of complacency. Groups such as
      the TRF, along with a fruit salad of insurgent outfits – the Kashmir Tigers, the
      People’s Anti-Fascist Front, and the United Liberation Front of Kashmir – were
      all spawned by Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s August 2019 revocation of Article
      370 of the Indian Constitution, which granted Kashmir singular autonomy. TRF has
      been particularly, and violently opposed, to the resettlement of the Kashmiri
      pandits, which they see as an effort to alter the region’s demography.


      The murderous incident raised the obvious question: Would Modi pay lip service
      to the 1972 Shimla Agreement, one that divided Kashmir into two zones of administration
      separated by a Line of Control? (A vital feature to that agreement is an understanding
      that both powers resolve their disputes without the need for third parties.)


      The answers came promptly enough. First came India’s suspension of the vital Indus
      Water Treaty, an essential agreement dealing with the distribution of water from
      India to Pakistan. Pakistan reciprocated firmly by suspending the Shimla Agreement,
      expelling Indian military diplomats, halting visa exemptions for Indian citizens
      and closing the Wagah border for trade.


      Hindu nationalism proved particularly stirred, and Modi duly fed its cravings.
      On May 7, India commenced Operation Sindoor, involving what were purportedly precision
      missile attacks on nine militant camps in Pakistan and the Jammu and Kashmir area
      controlled by Islamabad. The operation itself had a scent of gendered manipulation,
      named after the vermillion used by married Hindu women to symbolise the durable
      existence of their husbands. Two female military officers – Colonel Sofiya Qureshi
      and Wing Commander Vyomika Singh – were tasked with managing the media pack.


      The Indian briefings celebrated the accuracy of the strikes on what were said
      to be the sites of Lashkar-e-Taiba, Jaish-e-Mohammed and Hizbul Mujahideen. 31
      suspected terrorists were said to have perished, though Pakistan insisted that
      civilians had been killed in this apparent feast of forensic precision. India’s
      Defence Minister Rajnath Singh would have none of it: Indian forces had only “struck
      only those who harmed our innocents”.


      The next day, it was operations against Pakistan’s air defence systems in Lahore
      that stole the show. The inevitable Pakistani retaliation followed on May 10,
      with the Indian return serve against 11 Pakistan air bases. What followed is one
      version: Pakistan’s military broke into a sweat. A cessation of hostilities was
      sought and achieved. Armchair pundits on the Indian side celebrated: India had
      successfully targeted the terrorist cells supported by Pakistan. If one is to
      read Anubhav Shankar Goswami seriously, Operation Sindoor was a stroke of genius,
      threatening “the Pakistan Army’s strategic shield against terrorists”.


      More accurately, this was a lovely little spilling of blood with weaponry between
      callow sibling throats, a pattern familiar since 1947. The two countries have
      fought four full blown conflicts, two over Kashmir. Along the way, they have made
      the world a lot safer by acquiring nuclear weapons.


      There was something for everyone in this retaliatory and counter retaliatory feast.
      India claimed strategic proficiency, keeping censorship on the matter tight. Pakistan
      could claim some prowess in shooting down five Indian jets, using Chinese weaponry
      including the J-10. With pride and pomp, they could even appoint Pakistani Army
      chief Asim Munir to the post of Field Marshal, an absurdly ceremonial gesture
      that gave the impression that the army had restored its tattered pride. It was
      to be expected that this was ample reward for his, in the words of the government,
      “strategic leadership and decisive role” in defeating India.


      The only ones to be notably ignored in this display of subcontinental machismo
      were the Kashmiris themselves, who face, in both the Pakistan and Indian administered
      zones, oppressive anti-terrorism laws, discriminatory practices and suppression
      of dissent and free speech.


      Ultimately, the bickering children were convinced to end their playground antics.
      The fact that the overbearing headmaster, the unlikely US President Donald Trump,
      eventually brought himself to bear on proceedings must have irritated them. After
      four days of conflict, the US role in defusing matters between the powers became
      evident. Kashmir, which India has long hoped to keep in museum-like storage, away
      from the international stage, had been enlivened. Trump even offered his services
      to enable New Delhi and Islamabad a chance to reach a more enduring peace. Praise
      for the president followed, notably from those wishing to see the Kashmir conflict
      resolved.


      In one sense, there seems little reason to worry. These are countries seemingly
      linked to sandpit grievances, scrapping, gouging and complaining about their lot.
      Even amidst juvenile spats, they can bicker yet still sign enduring ceasefires.
      In February 2021, for instance, the militaries of both countries cobbled together
      a ceasefire which ended four months of cross-border skirmishes. A mere two violations
      of the agreement (how proud they must have been) was recorded for the rest of
      the year. In 2022, a solitary incident of violation was noted.


      A needlessly florid emphasis was made on the conflict by Indian political scientist
      Pratap Bhanu Meta. This was an encounter lacking “decisive victory and no clear
      political end”. It merely reinstated “the India-Pakistan hyphenation”. In one
      sense, this element of hyphenation – the international perception of two subcontinental
      powers in an eternal, immature squabble – was something India seemed to be marching
      away from. But Prime Minister Modi, despite his grander visions for India, is
      a sectarian fanatic. History shows that fanaticism tends to shrink, rather than
      enlarge the mind. In that sense, he is in good company with those other uniformed
      fanatics in uniform.'

      various militant groups opposing demographic changes in the area. In response,
      India suspended the Indus Water Treaty and launched Operation Sindoor, targeting
      militant camps in Pakistan, which prompted a military exchange between the two
      nations. While India claimed success in its operations, Pakistan asserted civilian
      casualties, and both sides engaged in a cycle of retaliation that ultimately required
      U.S. intervention to de-escalate tensions. Despite a temporary ceasefire, the
      ongoing conflict continues to marginalize the Kashmiri people, who suffer under
      oppressive laws and practices from both governments, while Modi's sectarian policies
      risk perpetuating the cycle of violence and instability in the region.

    url: https://www.counterpunch.org/2025/05/22/celluloid-exploitation-immigrants-and-reality-television/
    text: 'Shocking it might be, yet still part of an old pattern. The US Department
      of Homeland Security is floating the idea of using a reality television program
      to select immigrants vying for US citizenship. Whether this involves gladiatorial
      combat or inane pillow battles remains to be seen, though it is bound to involve
      airhead celebrity hosts and a set of fabricated challenges. What matters is the
      premise: the reduction of a government agency’s functions to a debauched spectacle
      of deceit, desperation and televisual pornography. Much, in some ways, like the
      Trump administration itself.


      In an interview with The Wall Street Journal, television producer Rob Worsoff,
      the man behind the Duck Dynasty reality show, comes clean in his monstrous intentions
      behind this proposed series he hopes to call The American: he has been pursuing
      this seedy project since the days of the Obama administration, hoping for some
      amoral stakeholder to bite. Worsoff, in true fashion, denies that such a project
      is intended as malicious (“this isn’t the ‘The Hunger Games’ for immigrants”),
      let alone denigrating the dignity of human worth. In the grand idea of full bloom,
      optimistic America, it is intended as hopeful, but most of all, competitive. Forget
      equal protection and a fair evaluation of merits; here is a chance for Social
      Darwinism to excel.


      Worsoff insists he is free of political ideology. “As an immigrant myself, I am
      merely trying to make a show that celebrates the immigration process, celebrate
      what it means to be American and have a national conversation about what it means
      to be American, through the eyes of people who want it most”. He proposes to do
      this by, for instance, sending immigrants to San Francisco where they find themselves
      in a mine to retrieve gold. Another would see the contestants journey to Detroit,
      where they will be placed on an auto assembly to reassemble a Model-T Ford chassis.


      The winners would end up on the Capitol steps, presumably to receive their citizenship
      in some staged ceremony for television. The losing contestants would go home with
      such generous prizes as a Starbucks gift card or airline points.


      DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin has apparently spoken to Worsoff on this steaming
      drivel, with the producer describing the response as “positive”. DHS Secretary
      Kristi Noem, it is said, has not officially “‘backed’ or even reviewed the pitch
      of any scripted or reality show. The Department of Homeland Security receives
      hundreds of television show pitches a year.” The mind can only dissipate in despair
      at such an observation, unsurprising in a land where the television, or televisual
      platforms, remain brain numbing instructors.


      That the DHS is considering this is unremarkable. The department has already participated
      in television projects and networks, To Catch a Smuggler being a case in point.
      Noem has also made much of the camera when it comes to dealing with immigrants.
      An ad campaign costing US$200 million promises to feature her admonishing illegal
      immigrants to return to their countries. No doubt the hairdressing and makeup
      department will be busy when tarting her up for the noble task.


      Broadcasters in a number of countries have also found the unsuspecting migrant
      or foreign guest captured by television irresistible viewing. It’s not just good,
      couch potato fun, but also a chance to fan prejudice and feed sketchy stereotypes.
      The reality TV show Border Security, which first aired on Australia’s free-to-air
      Channel 7 in 2004, proved to be a pioneering model in this regard. Not only did
      it provide a chance to mock the eating habits of new arrivals as food stuffs were
      confiscated by customs officers with names like “Barbs”, the program could also
      impute an intention to attack the Australian agricultural sector with introduced
      pests and diseases. These depictions went hand in hand with the demonising strategy
      of the Australian government towards unwanted asylum seekers and refugees (“Stop
      the Boats!” was the cry), characterised by lengthy spells of detention in an offshore
      tropical gulag.


      The plight of the vulnerable immigrant has also become a matter of pantomime substitution,
      an idea supposedly educative in function. Why not act out the entire migrant experience
      with reality television individuals with particularly xenophobic views?


      In February, this is exactly what took place in a reality television show vulgarly
      titled Go Back to Where You Come From aired on the UK’s Channel 4, running four
      episodes where selected, largely anti-immigration participants, according to Channel
      4, “experience some of the most perilous parts of the refugee journeys”. It comes
      as little surprise that the series is modelled on an Australian precursor made
      in the early 2010s.


      Even pro-immigrant groups were reduced to a state of admiring stupor, with the
      Refugee Council, a British charity, praising the worth of such shows to “have
      huge potential to highlight the stories behind the headlines”. Gareth Benest,
      advocacy director at the International Broadcasting Trust charity, also thought
      it instructive that the participants “face the reality of irregular migration
      and to challenge their preconceptions.”


      French politician Xavier Bertrand failed to identify similar points, calling the
      program “nauseating”. In his attack on the experiment, he saw the deaths across
      the English Channel as “a humanitarian tragedy, not the subject of a game”. But
      a game it has become, at least when placed before the camera.'
    one_sentence_summary: The U.S. Department of Homeland Security is considering a
      reality TV show concept for selecting immigrants for citizenship, proposed by
      producer Rob Worsoff, which critics argue reduces the immigration process to a
      degrading spectacle that trivializes the dignity of human worth and perpetuates
      harmful stereotypes.
    paragraph_summary: The US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is considering a
      controversial reality television program, proposed by producer Rob Worsoff, that
      would select immigrants for US citizenship through competitive challenges, reminiscent
      of a spectacle rather than a dignified process. Worsoff, who has pursued this
      idea since the Obama administration, claims the show, tentatively titled "The
      American," aims to celebrate the immigration process but raises concerns about
      reducing the serious nature of immigration to a form of entertainment that could
      promote Social Darwinism. The concept involves contestants engaging in absurd
      tasks, such as mining for gold or assembling cars, with winners receiving citizenship
      in a staged ceremony, while losers get trivial prizes. This proposal reflects
      a troubling trend in media that exploits the immigrant experience for entertainment,
      echoing similar reality shows in other countries that have often perpetuated negative
      stereotypes and prejudices against migrants. Critics argue that such portrayals
      trivialize the serious humanitarian issues surrounding immigration, reducing vulnerable
      individuals to mere entertainment fodder.

  - title: Al-Sharaa, Trump and Sanctions
    url: https://www.counterpunch.org/2025/05/20/al-sharaa-trump-and-sanctions/
    text: 'Contrary to the propaganda of moral upstarts, terrorism pays. It proves rewarding.
      It establishes states and reconstitutes others. It encourages change, for ill
      or otherwise. The stance taken, righteously pitiful, on not negotiating with those
      who practise it, is as faulty as battling gravity. The case of Syria’s interim
      president, Ahmed al-Sharaa, is a brilliant example of this. While seen as a new
      broom that did away with the government of President Bashar al-Assad in such stunning
      fashion, al-Sharaa’s bristles remain blood speckled.


      The scene says it all: a meeting lasting 37 minutes in Riyadh with a US President
      holding hands in communal machismo with a bearded Jihadi warrior who once had
      a $10 million bounty on his head. Present was the delighted Saudi Crown Prince,
      Mohammad bin Salman, with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan joining by telephone.


      It proved most rewarding for al-Sharaa, who has become a salesman for the new
      Syria, scrubbing up for appearances. His main message: remove crushing sanctions
      barring access to investment and finance. It also proved rewarding for the efforts
      made by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in convincing the Trump administration that
      a new approach towards Damascus was warranted. “The sanctions,” reflected Trump,
      “were brutal and crippling and served as an important, really, an important function
      nevertheless at the time, but now it’s their time to shine.” But lifting sanctions
      would offer Syria “a chance at greatness”. This signalled a striking volte face
      from the stance taken in December 2024, when Trump expressed the view that Syria
      was “a mess”, not a friend of the United States and not deserving of any intervention
      from Washington.


      In remarks made by Trump to journalists keeping him company, the US President
      expressed admiration for the strongman, the brute, the resilient survivor. “Tough
      guy, very strong past.” And what a past, one marked by links to al-Qaeda via the
      affiliate Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) group that were only severed in 2017. HTS’s
      predecessor, Jabhat al-Nusra, was commanded by al-Sharaa, then known by his nom
      de guerre, Abu Mohammad al-Jolani. In January 2017, HTS was born as a collective
      of Salafi jihadists comprising Harakat Nour al-Din al-Zinki, Liwa al-Haq, Jaysh
      al-Sunna and Jabhat Ansar al-Din.


      Even at present, a shadow lingers over al-Sharaa’s interim government. In March,
      over 100 people were butchered in the coastal city of Banias. These atrocities
      were directed against the Alawite minority and instigated by militias affiliated
      with the new regime, ostensibly as part of a response to attacks in Latakia and
      Tartous from armed groups affiliated with the deposed Assad regime. According
      to Amnesty International’s Secretary General Agnès Callamard, “the authorities
      failed to intervene to stop the killings. Once again, Syrian civilians have found
      themselves bearing the heaviest cost as parties to the conflict seek to settle
      scores.”


      The announcement by Trump on lifting US sanctions sent officials scurrying. While
      the plan to bring Syria out of the cold had been on the books for some months,
      the timing, as with all things with the US president, was fickle. Presidential
      waivers on sanctions do, after all, only go so far and the more technically minded
      will have to pour over the details of repeal.


      The Secretary of State Marco Rubio offered a dose of clarification some 24 hours
      after the announcement. “If we make enough progress, we’d like to see the law
      repealed, because you’re going to struggle to find people to [invest] in a country
      when [at any point] in six months, sanctions could come back. We’re not there
      yet. That’s premature.”


      Progress is in the works, with Rubio meeting his Syrian counterpart, Foreign Minister
      Asad Hassan al-Shaibani in Antalya on May 15. In comments from State Department
      spokesman, Tammy Bruce, the Secretary “welcomed the Syrian government’s calls
      for peace with Israel, efforts to end Iran’s influence in Syria, commitment to
      ascertaining the fate of US citizens missing or killed in Syria, and elimination
      of all chemical weapons.”


      In answers to a press gathering, Rubio revealed how much of a success al-Sharaa
      has been in wooing Washington. “We have governing authorities there now who have
      expressed, not openly and repeatedly, that they do – that this is a nationalistic
      movement designed to building their country in a pluralistic society in which
      all the different elements of Syrian society are able to live together.” There
      had also been an interest in normalising ties with Israel and “driving out foreign
      fighters and terrorists and others that would destabilize the country and are
      enemies of this transitional authority.”


      While no mention is made of al-Sharaa’s own colourful, bloodied past, the previous
      ruler, Assad, comes in for scathing mention. His rule was “brutal”, one characterised
      by gassing and murdering “his own people”. It was Assad who sowed the seeds that
      would allow foreign fighters to take root in Syria’s soil. How curious that HTS
      would have attracted those very same fighters.


      Things have come full circle. The Assad dynasts, who kept a watchful eye on fundamentalist
      Islamists, are gone. The Islamists, with their various backers, Turkey and Saudi
      Arabia being most prominent, are now nominally in charge. The rest is a confidence
      trick that might, given al-Sharaa’s recent performance, just work.'
    one_sentence_summary: The article argues that terrorism can yield political rewards,
      exemplified by Syria's interim president Ahmed al-Sharaa, whose past connections
      to extremist groups and recent negotiations with the U.S. signal a troubling shift
      in international relations and the potential lifting of sanctions against Syria,
      despite ongoing violence and human rights abuses under his regime.
    paragraph_summary: The article discusses the complex dynamics of terrorism and governance
      in Syria, highlighting the rise of interim president Ahmed al-Sharaa, who has
      transitioned from a jihadist leader to a key figure in the new Syrian regime.
      Despite his violent past, including connections to al-Qaeda, al-Sharaa is now
      advocating for the lifting of U.S. sanctions to facilitate investment and recovery
      in Syria, a shift supported by former President Trump and Saudi Arabia. The article
      notes the ongoing violence and human rights abuses under al-Sharaa's regime, including
      recent atrocities against the Alawite minority, while emphasizing the U.S. administration's
      willingness to engage with the new leadership in hopes of stabilizing the region.
      It concludes that the power dynamics in Syria have shifted from the Assad regime
      to Islamist factions, raising questions about the future of governance and peace
      in the country.

    text: 'They seemed made for each other. A former reality television star, with dubious
      real estate credentials, a freakish alienation from the truth, and the various
      leaders of the Gulf States, who never found truthful assessments that worthwhile
      anyway. This was certainly no time to be frugal and modest. Many a country might
      be dealing with soaring prices, inaccessible housing markets, and the cost of
      eggs, but nothing would be spared in spoiling US President Donald Trump with overpriced
      kitsch and exotica. Here was the MAGA brand in full flower.


      With crude indulgence, Saudi Arabia’s putative leader, Crown Prince Mohammed bin
      Salman, pampered and spoiled the US president with hospitality and a spray of
      undertakings and agreements during the first part of his Arabian Gulf tour. Six
      US-made F-15 fighters piloted by the Saudis escorted Air Force One as it approached
      Riyadh on May 13. There was the coffee ceremony within the royal terminal in the
      airport, a limousine flanked by white Arabian horses, and a decorative honour
      guard equipped with golden swords.


      This was a time for luxury and boundless bad taste, not bleeding hearts and bleating
      consciences. Memories of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, murdered in October 2018
      on orders by the crown prince, could be silenced if not expunged altogether. As
      for climate change, what of it? On golden chairs in the royal place, the Crown
      Prince and US President could bask in each other’s triumphal, emetic glow. Trump
      exclaimed that “we like each other a lot”. In a speech, he also uttered words
      of music to the royal: no foreign leader should be “giving you lectures on how
      to live and how to govern your own affairs.”


      An extravagant luncheon that followed featured a veritable Who’s Who of American
      corporatocracy, among them Stephen Schwarzman of the Blackstone Group, Jane Fraser
      of Citicorp, Ruth Porat of Google, and Alex Karp of Palantir.


      The value of the agreements reached between Riyadh and Washington approximate
      to US$600 billion, if one is to trust the anomalous “fact sheets” released by
      the White House. The nature of these commitments was not exactly clear, though
      they promise to cover energy security, defence, technology and access to critical
      minerals. Terms with little clarity (“global infrastructure”, for instance) were
      thrown around. Naturally, Trump will not be outdone in any deal, insisting that
      this was all part of the America First Trade and Investment Policy that is placing
      “the American economy, the American worker, and our national security first.”


      A few examples were mentioned, though these figure as ongoing commitments: the
      plans of Saudi Arabia’s DataVolt to invest US$20 billion in US data centres and
      energy infrastructure; the promise by Google, DataVolt, Oracle, Salesforce, AMD
      and Uber to invest US$80 billion in “cutting-edge transformative technologies
      in both countries.” The inevitable defence sales agreement was also praised, one
      hailed as the largest in history. Worth almost US$142 billion, it will involve
      over a dozen US defence firms supplying the Kingdom with equipment and technology
      in air force and space capabilities, air and missile defence, maritime and coastal
      security, border security and land forces and improved information and communication
      systems.


      This was merely the start of the Trump Splash Show. Onward to Qatar, where another
      ceremonial escort of F-15 fighter planes greeted the president. Clearly, the ruling
      Emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, was not going to be outdone by his Saudi
      counterparts. For a change, however, the president’s motorcade travelling from
      Doha airport to Amiri Diwan was greeted by a cavalry of mounted camels. “I haven’t
      seen camels like that in a long time,” fluted the impressed leader. “And really,
      we appreciate it very much.” But showing that imperishable tradition can exist
      alongside technological progress, red Tesla Cybertrucks also featured in the motorcade.
      This was a sweet gesture, given that Elon Musk’s company has an inventory of unsold
      Cybertrucks worth US$800 billion languishing in dealerships.


      With the welcome indulgence concluded, the serious discussions began. These were
      primarily focused on aviation, defence and energy priorities. Of note was a contract
      with Doha for 210 Boeing-made 787 Dreamliners and 777x aircraft worth US$96 billion.
      The US plane maker has been struggling of late, bedevilled by mishaps and questions
      about the quality of its manufacture. But glossy salvations are possible in the
      garden of MAGA make believe. “Congratulations to Boeing,” cooed Trump. “Get those
      planes out there.”


      The contract was part of a number of economic commitments from Qatar initially
      claimed by the White House to be worth a staggering US$1.2 trillion. As mathematics
      is not the strong suit of the Trump administration, the same announcement also
      qualifies the over trillion dollar boast by announcing “economic deals totalling
      more than $243.5 billion between the United States and Qatar, including an historic
      sale of Boeing aircraft and GE Aerospace engines to Qatar Airways.” Also included
      is an almost US$2 billion agreement allowing Qatar to acquire the MQ-9B remotely
      piloted aircraft system from General Atomics, and a US$1 billion agreement for
      Doha’s purchase of Raytheon’s small unmanned aircraft integrated defeat system.


      In a shameless effort to outdo Riyadh, the Qatari royal family threw in a luxury
      747 plane worth $400 million for the US Department of Defense, intended for Trump’s
      use as a temporary substitute Air Force One. Reported as being a “palace in the
      sky”, the president sees it as a gift of infinite, irrefutable generosity. “It’s
      a great gesture from Qatar,” he reasoned. “I appreciate it very much. I would
      never be one to turn down that kind of offer.”


      As with his keenness to avoid anything that might ruffle feathers, or disturb
      restful camels, this was not a trip for presidential agitation. He was far away
      from irritating European allies. Here was Qatar, previously accused by Trump of
      being a sponsor of terrorism, rehabilitated in golden glory. Forget the security
      implications and brazen corruption inherent in such a move: all the parties concerned
      could gloat without consequential censure.'
    one_sentence_summary: During his extravagant tour of the Arabian Gulf, US President
      Donald Trump was lavished with luxury and significant economic agreements by Saudi
      Arabia and Qatar, showcasing a stark contrast to pressing global issues and reinforcing

      luxurious ceremonies, and significant economic agreements worth hundreds of billions
      of dollars, focusing on defense, technology, and energy. Despite the backdrop
      of past controversies, such as the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi and Qatar's
      previous designation as a terrorism sponsor, the visit emphasized a mutual indulgence
      in opulence and a disregard for pressing global issues like climate change. The
      agreements included major defense contracts and investments from various American
      corporations, showcasing a blend of traditional hospitality and modern commerce,
      all while Trump promoted his "America First" agenda.

  - title: 'Fantasy and Exploitation: The US-Ukraine Minerals Deal'
    url: https://www.counterpunch.org/2025/05/15/fantasy-and-exploitation-the-us-ukraine-minerals-deal/
    text: 'The agreement between Washington and Kyiv to create an investment fund to
      search for rare earth minerals has been seen as something of a turn by the Trump
      administration. From hectoring and mocking the Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky
      before the cameras on his visit to the US capital two months ago, President Donald
      Trump had apparently softened. It was easy to forget that the minerals deal was
      already on the negotiating table and would have been reached but for Zelensky’s
      fateful and ill-tempered ambush. Dreams of accessing Ukrainian reserves of such
      elements as graphite, titanium and lithium were never going to dissipate.


      Details remain somewhat sketchy, but the agreement supposedly sets out a sharing
      of revenues in a manner satisfactory to the parties while floating, if only tentatively,
      the prospect of renewed military assistance. That assistance, however, would count
      as US investment in the fund. According to the White House, the US Treasury Department
      and US International Development Finance Corporation will work with Kyiv “to finalize
      governance and advance this important partnership”, one that ensures the US “an
      economic stake in securing a free, peaceful, and sovereign future for Ukraine.”


      In its current form, the agreement supposedly leaves it to Ukraine to determine
      what to extract in terms of the minerals and where this extraction is to take
      place. A statement from the US Treasury Department also declared that, “No state
      or person who financed or supplied the Russian war machine will be allowed to
      benefit from the reconstruction of Ukraine.”


      Ukraine’s Minister of Economy, Yulia Svyrydenko, stated that the subsoil remained
      within the domain of Kyiv’s ownership, while the fund would be “structured” on
      an equal basis “jointly managed by Ukraine and the United States” and financed
      by “new licenses in the field of critical materials, oil and gas – generated after
      the Fund is created”. Neither party would “hold a dominant vote – a reflection
      of equal partnership between our two nations.”


      The minister also revealed that privatisation processes and managing state-owned
      companies would not be altered by the arrangements. “Companies such as Ukrnafta
      and Energoatom will stay in state ownership.” There would also be no question
      of debt obligations owed by Kyiv to Washington.


      That this remains a “joint” venture is always bound to raise some suspicions,
      and nothing can conceal the predatory nature of an arrangement that permits US
      corporations and firms access to the critical resources of another country. For
      his part, Trump fantasised in a phone call to a town hall on the NewsNation network
      that the latest venture would yield “much more in theory than the $350 billion”
      worth of aid he insists the Biden administration furnished Kyiv with.


      Svyrydenko chose to see the Reconstruction Investment Fund as one that would “attract
      global investment into our country” while still maintaining Ukrainian autonomy.
      Representative Gregory Meeks, the ranking Democrat on the House of Foreign Affairs
      Committee, thought otherwise, calling it “Donald Trump’s extortion of Ukraine
      deal”. Instead of focusing on the large, rather belligerent fly in the ointment
      – Russian President Vladimir Putin – the US president had “demonstrated nothing
      but weakness” towards Moscow.


      The war mongering wing of the Democrats were also in full throated voice. To make
      such arrangements in the absence of assured military support to Kyiv made the
      measure vacuous. “Right now,” Democratic Senator Chris Murphy saidon MSNBC television,
      “all indications are that Donald Trump’s policy is to hand Ukraine to Vladimir
      Putin, and in that case, this agreement isn’t worth the paper that it’s written
      on.”


      On a certain level, Murphy has a point. Trump’s firmness in holding to the bargain
      is often capricious. In September 2017, he reached an agreement with the then
      Afghan president Ashraf Ghani to permit US companies to develop Afghanistan’s
      rare earth minerals. Having spent 16 years in Afghanistan up to that point, ways
      of recouping some of the costs of Washington’s involvement were being considered.
      It was agreed, went a White House statement sounding all too familiar, “that such
      initiatives would help American companies develop minerals critical to national
      security while growing Afghanistan’s economy and creating new jobs in both countries,
      therefore defraying some of the costs of United States assistance as Afghans become
      more reliant.”


      Ghani’s precarious puppet regime was ultimately sidelined in favour of direct
      negotiations with the Taliban that eventually culminated in their return to power,
      leaving the way open for US withdrawal and a termination of any grand plans for
      mineral extraction.


      A coterie of foreign policy analysts abounded with glowing statements at this
      supposedly impressive feat of Ukrainian diplomacy. Shelby Magid, deputy director
      of the Atlantic Council think tank’s Eurasia Centre, thought it put Kyiv “in their
      strongest position yet with Washington since Trump took office”. Ukraine had withstood
      “tremendous pressure” to accept poorer proposals, showing “that it is not just
      a junior partner that has to roll over and accept a bad deal”.


      Time and logistics remain significant obstacles to the realisation of the agreement.
      As Ukraine’s former minister of economic development and current head of Kyiv
      school of economics Tymofiy Mylovanov told the BBC, “These resources aren’t in
      a port or warehouse; they must be developed.” Svyrydenko had to also ruefully
      concede that vast resources of mineral deposits existed in territory occupied
      by Russian forces. There are also issues with unexploded mines. Any challenge
      to the global rare earth elements (REEs) market, currently dominated by China
      (60% share of production of raw materials; 85% share of global processing output;
      and 90% manufacturing share of rare earth magnets), will be long in coming.'
    one_sentence_summary: The recent agreement between the Trump administration and
      Ukraine to establish an investment fund for rare earth minerals marks a shift
      in U.S.-Ukraine relations, though concerns remain about the potential exploitation
      of Ukrainian resources and the effectiveness of the deal in the context of ongoing
      military support and geopolitical tensions with Russia.
    paragraph_summary: The recent agreement between the Trump administration and Ukraine
      to establish an investment fund for rare earth minerals marks a notable shift
      in U.S.-Ukraine relations, moving from previous tensions to a potential partnership.
      This deal, which aims to facilitate the extraction of valuable minerals like graphite,
      titanium, and lithium, includes provisions for revenue sharing and hints at renewed
      military assistance, although this would be classified as U.S. investment. Ukrainian
      officials assert that they will maintain ownership of their subsoil resources
      and that the fund will be jointly managed, ensuring equal partnership. However,
      skepticism remains regarding the deal's effectiveness, especially in light of
      ongoing Russian aggression and the historical context of U.S. foreign policy in
      similar situations, such as in Afghanistan. Critics, including some Democratic
      lawmakers, argue that without guaranteed military support, the agreement may ultimately
      benefit U.S. corporations more than Ukraine itself, raising concerns about the
      implications for Ukrainian sovereignty and the broader geopolitical landscape.

      ways, outside it. It was the one rare occasion in the twenty-first century where
      ancient ceremony, the old boy network – many presumptive virgins – along with
      festive dressing up, were seen with admiration rather than suspicion. Feminists
      were nowhere to be heard. Women knew their place; the phallocrats were in charge.
      Secret processes and factions, unscrutinised by media or any temporal body, could
      take place in secure, deliberative seclusion. Reverential followers of unquestioning
      loyalty turned up to the square of St. Peter’s Basilica in Rome awaiting the news
      of the election. Then, the white smoke rises from the Sistine Chapel’s chimney,
      with gasps of excitement and elation.


      Taking a punt on who the new leader of the Catholic Church will be once the conclave
      of Cardinals concludes is a failing bet. A mischievous remark was once made by
      an Australian commentator on Church matters that you would have better chances
      picking a winner at the Melbourne Cup horse race than the next pontiff.


      The choice of Leo XIV, formerly Cardinal Robert Francis Prevost, Prefect of the
      Dicastery of Bishops, was suitably surprising. Few had their cards on a pick from
      the United States, let alone a pick from Chicago, Illinois. But ever politic,
      the church narrative was quick to point out his naturalised status as a Peruvian
      and his elevation to the position of Bishop of Chiclayo in September 2015. He
      had been an Augustinian missionary. Not only was he a Western hemispheric representative,
      but one who doubled up as truly American, comprising North and South. This was
      an identitarian jackpot, a treat for the advertising wing of the Vatican.


      Clues on what Leo’s reign will look like are few in number. “We must seek together,”
      he urges, “how to be a missionary Church, a Church that builds bridges, dialogue,
      always open to receive like this square with its open arms, all, all who need
      our charity, our presence, dialogue and love.” His choice of name suggests a lineage
      of diplomatic and doctrinal-minded figures.


      Much Fourth Estate commentary has been vague, laden with cryptic references and
      snatches of speculation. In the absence of detail, obsession over minutiae becomes
      paramount. He turned up in the garb of Benedict XVI, suggested one observer on
      the BBC World Service, but spoke like his immediate predecessor, Pope Francis
      I. “We saw a balance of the aesthetics of the traditional church,” opined Charlie
      Gillespie of Sacred Heart University, “along with language that sounded like Pope
      Francis.”


      Any use of the term “moderate” is also bound to be meaningless, though Leo’s brother,
      John Prevost, has aired his own prediction: “I don’t think we’ll see any extremes
      either way.” Such a figure is straitjacketed by doctrine and buttoned up by process.
      One who is bound to follow ancient texts drafted by the superstitious, however
      modernised in interpretation, will be caged by them. In 2012, for instance, Prevost
      was revealing on that very issue when commenting on church attitudes to homosexuality.
      Certain Western values, he thought, proved sympathetic to views “at odds with
      the gospel”, one of them being the “homosexual lifestyle.”


      The same cannot be said about Leo’s attitudes to migrants and the poor. A social
      media account bearing Prevost’s name did not shy away from attacking the immigration
      policy of the Trump administration via a number of reposted articles. In February,
      for instance, an article from the National Catholic Reporter titled “JD Vance
      is wrong: Jesus doesn’t ask us to rank our love for others” featured. Suffice
      to say that his selection did not impress certain figures in the MAGA movement,
      most notably Steve Bannon. Calling Leo the “worst pick for MAGA Catholics,” Bannon
      sniffed a conspiracy. “This is an anti-Trump vote by the globalists that run the
      Curia – this is the pope Bergoglio [Francis I] and his clique wanted.”


      The orbit of other problems will also be impossible for the new pontiff to escape.
      The stain of clerical sex abuse remains an immovable reminder of organisational
      defect and depravity. Terrier like activists continue their sorties against the
      Church, demanding redress and publishing their findings on such outlets as ConclaveWatch.org.
      Earlier this year, the Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests (SNAP), along
      with Nates Mission, another survivors’ organisation, named the then Cardinal Prevost
      as one of six figures seminal in covering up sexual abuse in the church. These
      formed a dossier of complaints submitted to Cardinal Pietro Parolin, the Vatican’s
      secretary of state. According to the campaigners, the dossier documenting claims
      of mismanagement and cover-ups marked “the first time multiple high-ranking cardinals
      have been targeted … by co-ordinated, survivor-led action.”


      An open letter published on May 8 by SNAP also proved sharp on the election. “The
      sex offender in the collar commits two crimes: one against the body, and one against
      the voice. The grand pageantry around your election reminds us: survivors do not
      carry the same weight in this world as you do.” The organisation further stated
      that Prevost, when provincial of the Augustinians, permitted Father James Ray,
      a priest accused of child abuse with restricted ministry since 1991, to reside
      at the Augustinians’ St. John Stone Friary in 2000. From the outset, the Pope’s
      ledger is already a heavy one.'
    one_sentence_summary: The election of Pope Leo XIV, formerly Cardinal Robert Francis
      Prevost, has sparked mixed reactions, with some viewing his selection as a surprising
      yet politically strategic choice for the Catholic Church, while others criticize
      his past associations with clerical abuse cover-ups and express concerns about
      his potential impact on contemporary social issues.
    paragraph_summary: The election of Pope Leo XIV, formerly Cardinal Robert Francis
      Prevost, has sparked a mix of admiration and skepticism, reflecting the complexities
      of the Catholic Church's leadership in the 21st century. While the traditional
      ceremony surrounding the papal conclave drew reverent crowds to St. Peter's Basilica,
      Leo's selection as the first American pope—though he is also a naturalized Peruvian—has
      raised questions about his potential direction for the Church. His calls for a
      more inclusive, missionary Church contrast with his previous conservative stances
      on issues like homosexuality, and his election has drawn criticism from some right-wing
      factions, including Steve Bannon, who view it as a repudiation of Trump-era values.
      Additionally, Leo faces the daunting legacy of clerical sex abuse scandals, with
      activists already linking him to past cover-ups, suggesting that his papacy will
      be heavily scrutinized from the outset as he navigates the challenges of modernizing
      the Church while adhering to its traditional doctrines.

    url: https://www.counterpunch.org/2025/05/09/expulsion-and-occupation-israels-proposed-gaza-plan/
    text: 'Killing civilians wholesale, starving them to convince those unaffected to
      change course, and shepherding whole populations like livestock into conditions
      of further misery would all qualify as heinous crimes in international law. When
      it comes to Israel’s war in Gaza, this approach is seen as necessary politics,
      unalloyed by the restraints of humanitarianism. When confronted with these harsh
      realities on the ground, unequivocal denials follow: This is not happening in
      Gaza; no one is starving. And if that were the case, blame those misguided savages
      in Hamas.


      As the conflict chugs along in pools of blood and bountiful gore, the confused
      shape of Israel’s intentions continues in all its glorious nebulousness. Pretend
      moderation clouds murderous desire. There is no sense that those unfortunate Israeli
      hostages captured by Hamas in its assault on October 7, 2023 matter anymore, being
      merely decorative for the imminent slaughter. There is even less sense that Hamas
      will be cleansed and removed from the strip, however attractive this idea continues
      to be.


      Such evident limits have not discouraged Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and
      his cabinet, who have decided that more force, that old province of the unimaginative,
      is the answer. According to the PM, the cabinet had agreed on a “forceful operation”
      to eliminate Hamas and salvage what is left of the hostage situation.


      A spokesperson for the Israel Defense Forces, Brigadier-General Effie Defrin,
      has explained on Israeli radio that the offensive will apparently ensure the return
      of the hostages. What follows will be “the collapse of the Hamas regime, its defeat,
      its submission”. Anywhere up to two million Palestinian civilians in Gaza will
      be herded into the ruins of the south. Humanitarian aid will be arranged by the
      Israeli forces, to be possibly distributed through approved contractors.


      The IDF chief of staff, Lt. General Eyal Zamier, confirmed that the approved plan
      will involve “the capture of the Strip and holding the territories, moving the
      Gazan population south for its defence, denying Hamas and the ability to distribute
      humanitarian supplies, and powerful attacks against Hamas.”


      Within the Israeli cabinet, ethnocentric and religious fires burn with bright
      fanaticism. The Israeli Finance Finister Bezalel Smotrich remains a figure who
      ignores floral subtlety in favour of the blood-stained sledgehammer. He remains
      that coherent link between cruel lawmaking and baffling violence. “Within a few
      months,” he boasts, “we will be able to declare that we have won. Gaza will be
      totally destroyed.” With pompous certitude, he also claimed that the next six
      months would see Hamas cease to exist.


      Such opinions, expressed at the “Settlements Conference” organised by the Makor
      Rishon newspaper in Ofra, a West Bank settlement, gives a sense of the flavour.
      Palestinians are to be “concentrated” on land located between the Egyptian border
      and the arbitrarily designated Morag Corridor. As with any potential abuser keen
      to violate his vulnerable charges while justifying it, Smotrich tried to impress
      with the idea that this was a “humanitarian” zone that would be free of “Hamas
      and terrorism”.


      The program here is clear in its chilling crudeness. Expulsion, relocation, transfer.
      These are the words famously used to move on populations of sizeable number in
      history, often at enormous cost. That this should involve lawmakers of the Jewish
      state adds a stunning, if perverse poignancy to this. They, the moved on in history,
      the expelled and the condemned wanderers, shall expel others and condemn them
      in turn. Smotrich also points the finger to desperation and hopelessness, the
      biting incentives that propel migration. The Palestinians will feel blessed in
      their banishment. “They will be totally despairing, understanding that there is
      no hope and nothing to look for in Gaza, and will be looking for relocation to
      begin a new life in other places.”


      Impossible to ignore in Smotrich’s steaming bile against the Palestinians is the
      broader view that no Palestinian state can arise, necessitating urgent, preventative
      poisoning. In addition to the eventual depopulation of Gaza, plans to reconstitute
      the contours of the West Bank, ensuring that Israeli and Palestinian traffic are
      separated to enable building and construction for settlements as a prelude to
      annexation, are to be implemented.


      The issue of twisting and mangling humanitarian aid in favour of Israel’s territorial
      lust has raised some tart commentary. A statement from the Humanitarian Country
      Team of the Occupied Palestinian Territory, a forum led by the UN Office for the
      Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), does not shy away from the realities
      on the ground. All supplies, including those vital to survival, have been blocked
      for nine weeks. Bakeries and community kitchens have closed, while warehouses
      are empty. Hunger, notably among children, is rampant. Israel’s plan, as presented,
      “will mean that large parts of Gaza, including the less mobile and most vulnerable
      people, will continue to go without supplies.”


      The UN Secretary General and the Emergency Relief Coordinator have confirmed that
      they will not cooperate in the scheme, seeing that it “does not adhere to the
      global humanitarian principles of humanity, impartiality, independence and neutrality.”


      The same point has been made by the foreign ministers of the United Kingdom, France
      and Germany. Despite all being solid allies of Israel, they have warned that violations
      of international law are taking place. “Humanitarian aid must never be used as
      a political tool and a Palestinian territory must not be reduced nor subjected
      to any demographic change”.


      To date, a promise lingers that the offensive will only commence once US President
      Donald Trump’s visit to Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar takes
      place. But no ongoing savaging of Gaza with some crude effort at occupation will
      solve the historical vortex that continues to drag the Jewish state risk and oblivion.'
    one_sentence_summary: The article critiques Israel's military strategy in Gaza,
      highlighting the humanitarian crises and potential war crimes resulting from its
      actions, while emphasizing the troubling rhetoric and intentions of Israeli leaders
      who advocate for the expulsion and suffering of Palestinian civilians under the
      guise of security and political necessity.
    paragraph_summary: The article critiques Israel's military strategy in Gaza, describing
      it as a brutal approach that disregards humanitarian principles and international
      law, characterized by the mass killing and starvation of civilians to achieve
      political ends. It highlights the Israeli government's intentions, particularly
      under Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich,
      to conduct a forceful operation aimed at eliminating Hamas while relocating Palestinian
      civilians into increasingly dire conditions. The article also notes the severe
      humanitarian crisis in Gaza, with essential supplies blocked and widespread hunger,
      as well as the international community's condemnation of Israel's tactics, emphasizing
      that humanitarian aid should not be manipulated for political purposes. Ultimately,
      it argues that such military actions will not resolve the underlying historical
      conflicts and risks further entrenching violence and suffering.

    url: https://www.counterpunch.org/2025/05/07/refashioned-history-liberal-catastrophes-and-labor-triumphs/
    text: 'The dust had barely settled on the Australian federal election on May 3 before
      the hagiographers, mythmakers and revisionists got to work. If history is seen
      as a set of agreed upon facts, there was a rapidly growing consensus that Labor’s
      imposing victory had been the result of a superb campaign, sparkling in its faultlessness.


      This did not quite match pre-election remarks and assessments. The government
      of Anthony Albanese had been markedly unconvincing, marked by dithering, short
      sightedness and a lack of conviction. It had, rather inexplicably, made the conservative
      Coalition led by that cruel, simian looking automaton Peter Dutton, look electable.


      Overall, the campaign on the part of both sides of politics was consistently dull
      and persistently mediocre. Expansive, broad ideas were eschewed in favour of minutiae
      and objects of bribery: tax matters, cutting fuel excise, forgiving some student
      debt, improved Medicare services and child care assistance. Issues such as the
      parlous reliance of Australia upon US security interests, not to mention the criminally
      daft obligations of the AUKUS security pact, or a detailed, coherent policy on
      addressing environmental and climate challenges, were kept in storage.


      What did become evident in the weeks leading up to the poll was that the Coalition
      policy palette, which never went beyond blotches of law and order (terrorism,
      criminal refugees, paedophilia forefront themes), mild bribes for “cost of living
      relief”; and illusory nuclear energy, failed to appeal. Its campaign lacked the
      barely modest bite of Labor, largely because it had been eclipsed by such oxygen
      drawing events as US President Donald Trump’s tariff regime and the death of Pope
      Francis I.


      It had also misread the mood of the electorate in pushing policies with a tangy
      Trump flavour, notably the proposed removal of 41,000 jobs from the public sector
      and the establishment of something similar to the US Department of Government
      Efficiency . (Country Liberal Senator Jacinta Nampijinpa Price unhelpfully promised
      to “make Australia great again.”) The Coalition, Dutton admitted after being accused
      by Labor of being “DOGE-y Dutton”, had “made a mistake” and “got it wrong”. The
      focus would be, instead, on natural attrition. There were also scrappy sorties
      on the cultural war front, featuring lashings of undesirable press outlets, such
      as the Australian Broadcasting Corporation and The Guardian (“hate media”, according
      to Dutton), and the presence of “wokeism” in schools.


      Flimsy soothsayers could also be found, many endorsing a Liberal-Nationals victory.
      “For the first time in my journalistic career,” beamed Sharri Markson of Sky News
      Australia on May 1, “I’m going to offer a pre-election editorial, endorsing one
      side of politics […] A Dutton prime ministership would give our great nation the
      fresh start we deserve.” With vigorous drumbeating, Markson could only see “our
      values under threat – from enemies and abroad” – and retaining Anthony Albanese
      as prime minister was dangerous. With the analytical skill of an unread, hungover
      undergraduate, the political astrologist found the PM a victim of “far-left ideology”,
      something “out of step with mainstream Australia.”


      With Labor’s victory assured, the fiscal conservatives at the Australian Financial
      Review proved sniffy, noting that Labor’s record on the economy did not warrant
      another term “but the Coalition has not made the case to change the government.”
      More explicit, with hectoring relish, was Australia’s premier shock jock of the
      press stable, Andrew Bolt. “No, the voters aren’t always right,” he wrote scoldingly
      in the News Corp yellow press. “This time they were wrong, and this gutless and
      incoherent Coalition should be ashamed.” Australians were set to “get more” of
      policies that had “left this country poorer, weaker, more divided and deeper in
      debt”.


      One is reminded of Henry Kissinger’s rebuke of Chilean democracy at the election
      of the socialist leader Salvador Allende. As one of US foreign policy’s chief
      malefactors, he refused to accept the proposition that a country could “go communist
      due to the irresponsibility of its own people.” Democracy was only worthy if directed
      by the appropriate interests.


      Senator Price, evidently rattled by the result, returned to the Trumpian well,
      hoping to draw attention to claims of irregular voting in rural polling booths.
      The Australian Electoral Commission, she told the ABC, “has been alerted to this
      over and over and does little with it. I urge the ABC, as a taxpayer funded organisation,
      to go out and see what is occurring.”


      There are other evident patterns that emerged in the vote. The old division between
      urban, metropolitan areas and rural and country communities has been coloured
      with sharpness. The Liberal Party, which must win seats in urban Australia, finds
      itself marginalised before its allies, the Nationals, who have retained their
      complement in regional and country areas. Party voices and strategists lament
      that not more was done after the 2022 defeat, with the Liberals refusing to address,
      among other things, the failure to appeal to female voters or the youth vote.


      Disappointing in such stonking majorities is the assumption that minority parties
      and independents can be ignored, if not with contempt, then with condescending
      politeness. Labor may well be soaring with the greatest return of seats in its
      history, but attitudes of the electorate can harden quickly. The move away from
      the major parties, as a trend, continues, and there is no room for complacency
      in a new Albanese government.'
    one_sentence_summary: Following Labor's decisive victory in the recent Australian
      federal election, there is a growing narrative that downplays the government's
      previous shortcomings and the lackluster campaigns of both major parties, while
      highlighting the need for the new administration to remain vigilant against shifting
      voter sentiments and the rise of minority parties.
    paragraph_summary: Following the Australian federal election on May 3, a narrative
      quickly emerged portraying Labor's victory as a result of a flawless campaign,
      despite pre-election critiques of Anthony Albanese's government as unconvincing
      and lacking conviction. Both major parties delivered uninspired campaigns focused
      on minor policy tweaks rather than addressing significant issues like US security
      reliance and climate change. The Coalition, led by Peter Dutton, failed to resonate
      with voters, misreading the electorate's mood and pushing unpopular policies reminiscent
      of Trumpism, while also facing criticism from various media figures for their
      performance. Despite Labor's historic seat gains, the article warns against complacency,
      highlighting a growing trend of voters turning to minority parties and independents,
      suggesting that the major parties must adapt to changing electoral dynamics to
      maintain support.

    text: 'The murder and starvation of populations in real time, subject to rolling
      coverage and commentary, is not usually the done thing. These are the sorts of
      activities kept quiet and secluded in their vicious execution. In the Gaza Strip,
      these actions are taking place with a confident, almost brazen assuredness.


      Israel has the means, the weapons and the sheer gumption to do so, and Palestinians
      in Gaza find themselves with few options for survival. The strategic objectives
      of the Jewish state, involving, for instance, the elimination of Hamas, have been
      shown to be nonsensically irrelevant, given that they are unattainable. Failed
      policies of de facto annexation and occupation are re-entering the national security
      argot.


      In yet another round of proceedings, this time initiated by a UN General Assembly
      resolution, the International Court of Justice is hearing from an array of nations
      and bodies (40 states and four international organisations) regarding Israel’s
      complete blockade of Gaza since March 2. Also featuring prominently are Israel’s
      efforts to attack the United Nations itself, notably UNRWA, the relief agency
      charged with aiding Palestinians.


      As counsel for the Palestinians, Blinne Ní Ghrálaigh outlined the central grievances.
      The restrictions on “the fundamental rights of the Palestinian people, [Israel’s]
      attacks on the United Nations and on UN officials, property and premises, its
      deliberate obstruction of the organisation’s work and its attempt to destroy an
      entire UN subsidiary organ” lacked precedent “in the history of the organisation”.
      Being not only “antithetical to a peace-loving state”, such actions were “a fundamental
      repudiation by Israel of its charter obligations owed both to the organisation
      and to all UN members and of the international rule of law”.


      Israel had further closed all relevant crossings into the Strip and seemingly
      planned “to annex 75 square kilometres of Rafah, one-fifth of Gaza, to [its] so-called
      buffer zone, permanently. This, together with Israel’s continuing maritime blockade,
      cuts Gaza and its people off from direct aid and assistance and from the rest
      of the world”.


      The submission by Ní Ghrálaigh went on to document the plight of Palestinian children,
      15,600 of whom had perished, with tens of thousands more injured, missing or traumatised.
      Gaza had become “home to the largest cohort of child amputees in the world, the
      largest orphan crisis in modern history, and a whole generation in danger of suffering
      from stunting, causing irreparable physical and cognitive impairments”.


      South Africa, which already has an application before the Court accusing Israel
      of violating the UN Genocide Convention, pointed to the international prohibition
      against “starvation as a method of warfare, including under siege or blockade”.
      Its representative Jaymion Hendricks insisted that Israel had “deployed the full
      range of techniques of hunger and starvation” against “the protected Palestinian
      population, which it holds under unlawful occupation.” The decision to expel UNRWA
      and relevant UN agencies should be reversed, and access to food, medicine and
      humanitarian aid resumed.


      In a chilling submission to the Court, Zane Dangor, director general of South
      Africa’s Department of International Relations and Cooperation, detected a scheme
      in the cruelty. “The humanitarian aid system is facing total collapse. This collapse
      is by design.”


      Israel’s response, one increasingly rabid to the obligations of humanitarian and
      international law, was best stated by its Foreign Minister, Gideon Sa’ar. In announcing
      that Israel would not participate in oral proceedings derided as a “circus”, he
      restated the long held position that UNRWA was “an organisation infiltrated beyond
      repair by terrorism.” Courts were once again being abused “to try and force Israel
      to cooperate with an organisation that is infested with Hamas terrorists, and
      it won’t happen”.


      Then came an agitated flurry of accusations shamelessly evoking the message from
      Émile Zola’s “J’Accuse” note of 1898, penned during the convulsions of the Dreyfus
      Affair: “I accuse UNRWA. I accuse the UN. I accuse the Secretary General, I accuse
      all those that weaponize international law and its institutions in order to deprive
      the most attacked country in the world, Israel, of its most basic right to defend
      itself.”


      The continuing blackening of UNRWA was also assured by Amir Weissbrod of Israel’s
      foreign ministry, who reiteratedthe claims that the organisation had employed
      1,400 Palestinians with militant links. Furthermore, some had taken part in Hamas’
      October 7, 2023 attacks on Israel. That such a small number had participated was
      itself striking and should have spared the organisation the savaging it received.
      But Israel has longed for the expulsion of an entity that is an accusing reminder
      of an ongoing, profane policy of oppression and dispossession.


      In her moving address to the Court, Ní Ghrálaigh urged the justices to direct
      Israel to allow aid to enter Gaza and re-engage the offices of UNRWA. Doing so
      might permit the re-mooring of international law, a ship increasingly put off
      course by the savage war in Gaza. The cold, somewhat fanatical reaction to these
      proceedings in The Hague by Israel’s officials suggest that anchoring international
      obligations, notably concerning Palestinian civilians, is off the list.'

      as a method of warfare, calling for the restoration of humanitarian aid access.
      In contrast, Israel's officials dismiss the proceedings, accusing the UN and its
      agencies of being infiltrated by terrorism and asserting their right to defend
      themselves. The article concludes with a call for the Court to compel Israel to
      allow aid into Gaza, reflecting a broader struggle to uphold international law
      amidst the conflict.

  - title: Yale, Ben-Gvir and Banning Palestinian Groups
    url: https://www.counterpunch.org/2025/04/28/yale-ben-gvir-and-banning-palestinian-groups/
    text: 'Universities are in a bind. As institutions of learning and teaching, knowledge
      learnt and taught should, or at the very least could, be put into practice. How
      unfortunate for rich ideas to linger in cold storage or exist as the mummified
      status of esoterica. But universities in the United States have taken fright at
      pro-Palestinian protests since October 7, 2023, becoming battlegrounds for the
      propaganda emissaries of Israeli public relations and the pro-evangelical, Armageddon
      lobby that sees the end times taking place in the Holy Land. Higher learning institutions
      are spooked by notions of Israeli brutality, and they are taking measures.


      These measures have tended to be heavy handed, taking issue with students and
      academic staff. The policy has reached another level in efforts by amphibian university
      managers to ban various protest groups who are seen as creating an environment
      of intimidation for other members of the university tribe. That these protesters
      merely wish to draw attention to the massacre of Palestinian civilians, including
      women, children, and the elderly, and the fact that the death toll, notably in
      the Gaza Strip, now towers at over 50,000, is a matter of inconvenient paperwork.


      Even worse, the same institutions are willing to tolerate individuals who have
      celebrated their own unalloyed bigotry, lauded their own racial and religious
      ideology, and deemed various races worthy of extinguishment or expulsion. Such
      a man is Israel’s National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, who found himself
      permitted to visit Yale University at the behest of the Jewish society Shabtai,
      a body founded by Democratic senator and Yale alumnus Cory Booker, along with
      Rabbi Shmully Hecht.


      Shabtai is acknowledged as having no official affiliation with Yale, though it
      is stacked with Yale students and faculty members who participate at its weekly
      dinners. Its beating heart was Hecht, who arrived in New Haven after finishing
      rabbinical school in Australia in 1996.


      The members of Shabtai were hardly unanimous in approving Ben-Gvir’s invitation.
      David Vincent Kimel, former coach of the Yale debate team, was one of two to send
      an email to a Shabtai listserv to express brooding disgruntlement. “Shabtai was
      founded as a space for fearless, pluralistic Jewish discourse,” the email remarks.
      “But this event jeopardizes Shabtai’s reputation and every future.” In views expressed
      to the Jewish Telegraphic Agency, Kimel elaborated: “I’m deeply concerned that
      we’re increasingly treating extreme rhetoric as just another viewpoint, rather
      than recognizing it as a distortion of constructive discourse.” The headstone
      for constructive discourse was chiselled sometime ago, though Kimel’s hopes are
      charming.


      As a convinced, pro-settler fanatic, Ben-Gvir is a fabled-Torah basher who sees
      Palestinians as needless encumbrances on Israel’s righteous quest to acquire Gaza
      and the West Bank. Far from being alone, Ben-Gvir is also the member of a government
      that has endorsed starvation and the deprivation of necessities as laudable tools
      of conflict, to add to an adventurous interpretation of the laws of war that tolerates
      the destruction of health and civilian infrastructure in the Gaza Strip.


      After a dinner at President Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort (the bad will be
      fed), Ben-Gvir was flushed with confidence. He wrote on social media of how various
      lawmakers had “expressed support for my very clear position on how to act in Gaza
      and that the food and aid depots should be bombed in order to create military
      and political pressure to bring our hostages home safely.” By any other standard,
      this was an admission to encouraging the commission of a war crime.


      In July last year, Israel’s State Prosecutor Amit Aisman reportedly sought permission
      from Attorney General Gali Baharav-Miara to open a criminal investigation into
      Ben-Gvir for alleged incitement of violence against residents of Gaza. The move
      was said to be a gesture to placate the International Court of Justice as it considers
      the genocide case filed by South Africa against Israel over the war in Gaza. In
      a string of increasingly agitated interim orders, the ICJ has asked that Israel
      comply, as signatory member, with the obligations imposed by the United Nations
      Genocide Convention. These include prohibitions against incitement to genocide.


      Incitement has become something of a nervous tic for the minister. In November
      2023, for instance, Ben-Gvir remarked that “When we say Hamas should be destroyed,
      it also means those who celebrate, those who support, and those who hand out candy
      – they’re all terrorists, and they should also be destroyed.” Seeing himself as
      essentially immune to any form of prosecution, Ben-Gvir gave the State Prosecutor
      a sound verbal thrashing, claiming that it was “trying to make an Israeli minister
      stand trial for ‘incitement’ against citizens of an enemy state that danced on
      the blood our soldiers on the streets of Gaza on October 7.”


      In a statement responding to protests against Ben-Gvir’s visit, Yale stated that
      the student encampments set up on April 22 on Beinecke Plaza were in violation
      of the university’s policies on the use of outdoor spaces. Students already on
      notice for previous protests along similar lines would face “immediate disciplinary
      action”. With dulling predictability, the university revealed that it was looking
      into “concerns … about disturbing anti-Semitic conduct at the gathering”.


      University officialdom had also focused on the activities of Yalies4Palestine,
      a student organisation whose club status was revoked for “sending calls over social
      media for others to join the event”. The statement makes the claim that the group
      “flagrantly violated the rules to which the Yale College Dean’s Office holds all
      registered student organizations”. Consequently, the body cannot receive funding
      from Yale sources, use the university name, participate in relevant student activities,
      or book spaces on the campus.


      This profaning of protest in a university setting is a convenient trick, using
      the popular weasel words of “offensive” and “unsafe” while deploying, more generically,
      the pitiful policy inventory that makes freedom of expression an impossibility.
      Mobilised accordingly, they can eliminate any debate, any discussion and any idea
      from the campus for merely being stingingly contrarian or causing twinges of intellectual
      discomfort. The moment the brain aches in debate, the offended howl and the administrators
      suppress. Play nice, dear university staff and students, or don’t play at all.
      Besides, Ben-Gvir, by Yale standards, is a half-decent fellow.'
    one_sentence_summary: U.S. universities are grappling with the fallout from pro-Palestinian
      protests and are increasingly suppressing dissenting voices while allowing controversial
      figures like Israel's National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir to speak, raising
      concerns about the erosion of free expression and constructive discourse on campuses.
    paragraph_summary: Universities in the U.S. are grappling with the fallout from
      pro-Palestinian protests that erupted after October 7, 2023, leading to heavy-handed
      responses from administration aimed at suppressing dissent and banning certain
      protest groups. This reaction comes amid a climate of fear regarding accusations
      of Israeli brutality, with institutions prioritizing the protection of their reputations
      over the promotion of open discourse. Notably, Yale University faced criticism
      for allowing a visit from Israel's National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir,
      whose extreme views and history of incitement have raised concerns about the implications
      for free speech and constructive dialogue on campus. In contrast, student organizations
      advocating for Palestinian rights have faced disciplinary actions and revocation
      of their status, illustrating a troubling trend of stifling debate under the guise
      of maintaining safety and decorum. The article highlights the tension between
      academic freedom and institutional responses to controversial political issues,
      suggesting that universities are increasingly prioritizing compliance and comfort
      over the robust exchange of ideas.

  - title: 'Dotty and Cretinous: Reviewing AUKUS'
    url: https://www.counterpunch.org/2025/04/22/dotty-and-cretinous-reviewing-aukus/
    text: 'It was a deal for the cretinous, hammered out by the less than bright for
      less than honourable goals. But AUKUS, the trilateral security alliance between
      Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States, is now finally receiving
      the broader opprobrium it should have had from the outset. Importantly, criticism
      is coming from those who have, at points, swooned at the prospect of acquiring
      a nuclear-powered submarine capability assuming, erroneously, that Australia somehow
      needs it.


      A report by the Strategic Analysis Australia think tank has found that AUKUS,
      despite the increasingly vain promise of supplying the Royal Australian Navy with
      nuclear powered submarines in 2032, has already become its own, insatiable beast.
      As beast it is, with the cost over the next four years for the submarine program
      coming in at A$17.3 billion, exceeding by some margin the capital budget of the
      Royal Australian Airforce (RAAF) at A$12.7 billion. One of the authors of the
      report, Marcus Hellyer, notes that “in terms of acquisition spending, the SSN
      [nuclear-powered attack submarine] enterprise has already become the ADF’s [Australian
      Defence Force’s] ‘fourth service’.”


      The report notes some remarkable figures.Expenditure on SSNs is estimated to be
      somewhere between A$53 billion and A$63 billion between 2024-2034, with the next
      five years of the decade costing approximately A$20 billion. The amount left over
      for the following years comes in at $33 to $44 billion, necessitating a target
      of $10 billion annually by the end of the financial decade in the early 2030s.
      What is astounding is the amount being swallowed up by the ADF’s investment program
      in maritime capabilities, which will, over the coming decade, come to 38% of the
      total investment.


      The SSN program has made its fair share in distorting the budget.The decade to
      2033-4 features a total budget of A$330 billion.But the SSN budget of $53-63 billion
      puts nuclear powered submarines at 16.1% to 19.1% more than either the domains
      of land and air relevant to Australia’s defence. “It’s hard to grasp how unusual
      this situation is,” the report notes with gravity. “Moreover, it’s one that will
      endure for decades, since the key elements of the maritime domain (SSNs and the
      two frigate programs) will still be in acquisition well into the 2040s. It’s quite
      possible that Defence itself doesn’t grasp the situation that it’s gotten into.”


      To add to the more specialist literature calling large parts of AUKUS expenditure
      into question comes the emergence of disquiet in political ranks. Despite the
      craven and cowardly bipartisan approval of Australia’s dottiest military venture
      to date, former Labor senator Doug Cameron, who fronts the Labor Against War group,
      is a symptom of growing dissent. “There are other more realistic and cost-effective
      strategies to protect our territorial integrity without subjugating ourselves
      to a dangerous, unpredictable and unworthy Trump administration.”


      On the other side of the political aisle, former Liberal Prime Minister Malcolm
      Turnbull is pessimistically inclined to the view that Australia will never get
      those much heralded submarines. “There will be Australian sailors serving on US
      submarines, and we’ll provide them with a base in Western Australia.” Furthermore,
      Australia would have “lost both sovereignty and security and a lot of money as
      well.”


      The spineless disposition of Australia’s political cadres may prove irrelevant
      to the forced obsolescence of the agreement, given the scrutiny of AUKUS in both
      the United States and the United Kingdom. The pugilistic nature of the tariff
      system imposed by the Trump administration on all countries, friendly or adversarial,
      has brought particular focus on the demands on naval and submarine construction.
      Senior Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Subcommittee, Virginia Senator Tim
      Kaine, told an AUKUS dinner in Washington this month that “We are already having
      trouble getting these ships and subs on time [and] on budget. Increase those prices
      – it’s going to be a problem.”


      Taine’s point is logical enough, given that steel and aluminium have been targeted
      by particularly hefty rates.Given the array of products requiring exchange in
      the AUKUS arrangement, tariffs would, the senator reasons, “slow us down and make
      things harder”.


      Another blow also looms.On April 9, the White House ordered the Department of
      Government Efficiency (DOGE) to comb through the procurement of US Navy vessels
      in order “to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of these processes” and
      contribute to the Trump administration’s Maritime Action Plan. Consistent with
      Trump’s near obsession of reviving national industry, the order seeks “to revitalize
      and rebuild domestic maritime industries and workforce to promote national security
      and economic prosperity.”


      Australian taxpayers have every reason to be further worried about this, given
      the order’s emphasis that US departments and agencies pursue “all available incentives
      to help shipbuilders domiciled in allied nations partner to undertake capital
      investment in the US to help strengthen the shipbuilding capacity of the US”.
      Given that that US submarine industrial base is already promised $US3 billion
      from Australia’s pockets, with $500 million already transferred in February, the
      delicious exploitation of Canberra’s stupidity continues apace.


      In the UK, the House of Commons Defence Committee this month announced a parliamentary
      inquiry into the defence pact, which will evaluate the agreement in light of changes
      that have taken place since 2021.“AUKUS has been underway for three years now,”
      remarked Defence Committee chairman and Labour MP, Tan Dhesi. “The inquiry will
      examine the progress made against each of the two pillars, and ask how any challenges
      could be addressed.”


      The first pillar, perennially spectral, stresses the submarine component, both
      in terms of transferring Virginia class SSNs to Australia and the construction
      of a bespoke nuclear-powered AUKUS submarine; the second focuses on the technological
      spread of artificial intelligence, quantum capabilities, hypersonic advances and
      cyber warfare. While Dhesi hopes that the inquiry may throw up the possibility
      of expanding the second pillar, beady eyes will be keen to see the near non-existent
      state regarding the first.But even the second pillar lacks definition, prompting
      Kaine to suggest the need for “some definition and some choices”. Nebulous, amorphous
      and foolish, this absurd pact continues to sunder.'
    one_sentence_summary: The AUKUS security alliance, aimed at providing Australia
      with nuclear-powered submarines, is facing increasing criticism for its exorbitant
      costs and questionable strategic value, with concerns raised about its impact
      on Australia's defense budget and sovereignty, as well as scrutiny from political
      figures and inquiries in both the U.S. and U.K. regarding its viability and effectiveness.
    paragraph_summary: The AUKUS security alliance between Australia, the UK, and the
      US is facing increasing criticism for its costly and seemingly misguided nuclear-powered
      submarine program, which is projected to consume between A$53 billion and A$63
      billion from 2024 to 2034, significantly impacting Australia's defense budget.
      A report from Strategic Analysis Australia highlights that the submarine initiative
      has become a dominant force within the Australian Defence Force's budget, overshadowing
      other military domains and raising concerns about long-term financial sustainability.
      Political dissent is growing, with figures from both major parties questioning
      the necessity and effectiveness of the program, while external pressures, such
      as tariffs and US domestic policy shifts, further complicate the situation. The
      UK Parliament is also scrutinizing the agreement, particularly its submarine component,
      which remains vague and underdeveloped. Overall, the AUKUS pact is increasingly
      viewed as a flawed and costly venture that may not deliver the promised security
      benefits.

  - title: 'De Facto Occupation: Israel’s Security Zone Strategy'
    url: https://www.counterpunch.org/2025/04/21/de-facto-occupation-israels-security-zone-strategy/
    text: 'In recent months, the Israeli Defense Forces have been much taken by a term
      that augurs poorly for peaceful accord in the Middle East. “Security zones” are
      being seized in the Gaza Strip, Lebanon and Syria. Land is, for claimed reasons
      of self-defence, being appropriated with brazen assuredness.It is hard, however,
      to see this latest turn as anything other than a de facto military occupation,
      a situation that will prolong the crisis of vulnerability the Jewish state so
      wishes to overcome. Israel’s insecurities are much the result of various expansions
      since 1948 that have only imperilled it to future attack and simmering acrimony.
      The pattern threatens to repeat itself.


      In Syria, Israel rapidly capitalised on the fall of the Assad regime by shredding
      the status quo. Within a matter of 11 days after the fleeing of the former President
      Bashar Al-Assad to Moscow, and again on February 1 this year, satellite images
      showed six military sites being constructed within what is nominally the UN-supervised
      demilitarised zone, otherwise known as the Area of Separation. A seventh is being
      constructed outside the zone and in Syria proper. Such busy feats of construction
      have also accompanied Israeli encroachment on the land of Syrian civilians, coupled
      with vexing housing raids, road closures and unsanctioned arrests.


      All this has taken place despite undertakings from Syria’s transitional President
      Ahmed al-Sharaa that he would recognise the 1974 agreement made with Israel, one
      which prohibits Israel from crossing the Alpha Line on the western edge of the
      Area of Separation. “Syria’s war-weary condition, after years of conflict and
      war, does not allow for new confrontations,” admitted the new leader on December
      14, 2024. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was only scornful, regarding
      the 1974 agreement between the two countries as a dead letter buried by history.
      “We will not allow any hostile force to establish itself on our border,” he snottily
      declared.


      Lebanon is also facing a stubborn IDF, one that refuses to abide by the Israel-Hezbollah
      agreement last November which promised the withdrawal of both forces from southern
      Lebanon, leaving the Lebanese army to take over the supervising reins. Lebanese
      President Joseph Aoun, who faces the herculean task of removing Hezbollah’s weapons
      while potentially integrating members of its group into the Lebanese army, has
      found his task needlessly onerous. In recent discussions with US deputy Mideast
      envoy Morgan Ortagus, the Lebanese leader reasoned “that Israel’s presence in
      the five disputed points gives Hezbollah a pretext to keep its weapons.”


      On April 16, Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz promised that such security
      zones would provide relevant buffers to shield Israeli communities.Ominously,
      the IDF would “Unlike in the past [not evacuate] areas that have been cleared
      and seized”. They would “remain in the security zones as a buffer between the
      enemy and [Israeli] communities in any temporary or permanent situation in Gaza
      – as in Lebanon and Syria.”


      In Gaza, it is becoming increasingly clear that any prospect of Palestinian autonomy
      or political independence is to be strangled and snuffed out. Israel has already
      arbitrarily created the “Morag Corridor”, which excises Rafah from the Strip,
      and the Netzarim Corridor, which severs Gaza in half. Katz has also promised that
      the policy of blocking all food, medicine and other vital supplies to Gaza implemented
      on March 2 will continue, as it “is one of the main pressure levers preventing
      Hamas from using it as a tool with the population”.


      Displacement orders, euphemised as “evacuation orders”, have become the staple
      of operating doctrine, the means of creating buffers of guns and steel. On April
      11, Israeli authorities issued two such orders, effectively “covering vast areas
      in northern and southern Gaza”, according to UN spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric.
      “Together, these areas span more than 24 square kilometres – roughly the size
      of everything south of Central Park here in Manhattan.” Within these zones of
      military seizure lie medical facilities and storage sites filled with vital supplies.


      The UN Human Rights office also expressed its concerns about Israel seemingly
      “inflicting on Palestinians in Gaza conditions of life increasingly incompatible
      with their continued existence as a group in Gaza.” The population was being “forcibly
      transferred into ever shrinking spaces with little or no access to life-saving
      services, including water, food, and shelter, and whey they continue to be subject
      to attacks.” Engaging in such conduct against a civilian population within an
      occupied territory, the office pointedly observes, satisfies the definition of
      a forcible transfer, being both a violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention and
      a crime against humanity under the Rome Statute of 1998.


      The latest doctrine of appropriation and indeterminate occupation adopted by Katz
      and the IDF has not impressed the Hostages and Missing Families Forum in Israel,
      long advocating for the release of Israeli hostages still being held in Gaza by
      Hamas. “They promised that the hostages come before everything,” came the organisation’s
      aggrieved observation. “In practice, however, Israel is choosing to seize territory
      before the hostages.” In doing so, the prerogatives of permanent conflict and
      habitual predation have displaced the more humane prerogatives of peace.'
    one_sentence_summary: The Israeli Defense Forces' recent establishment of "security
      zones" in Gaza, Lebanon, and Syria is seen as a de facto military occupation that
      exacerbates regional tensions and undermines prospects for peace, while also violating
      international law and worsening the humanitarian crisis for Palestinians.
    paragraph_summary: The article discusses the Israeli Defense Forces' recent actions
      in the Gaza Strip, Lebanon, and Syria, which involve the establishment of "security
      zones" that are viewed as a de facto military occupation, potentially exacerbating

      its military presence despite a 1974 agreement prohibiting such actions, while
      in Lebanon, the IDF has ignored commitments to withdraw, complicating the Lebanese
      government's efforts to manage Hezbollah. In Gaza, Israel's policies, including
      the creation of corridors that disrupt Palestinian autonomy and the continuation
      of blockades on essential supplies, have led to severe humanitarian concerns,
      with the UN warning that these actions may constitute violations of international
      law. The article concludes by highlighting the frustration of Israeli families
      advocating for hostages held by Hamas, who feel that territorial appropriation
      is prioritized over humanitarian considerations.

    url: https://www.counterpunch.org/2025/04/17/flexible-and-sly-indonesian-defense-policy-russia-and-australian-anxiety/
    text: 'Island states tend to be anxious political entities. Encircled by water,
      seemingly defended by natural obstacles, the fear of corrupting penetration is
      never far. Threats of such unwanted intrusion are embellished and magnified. In
      the case of Australia, these have varied from straying Indonesian fishermen who
      are seen as terrors of border security, to the threatened establishment of military
      bases in the Indo-Pacific by China. With Australia facing a federal election,
      the opportunity to exaggerate the next threat is never far away.


      On April 14, the specialist military publication Janes reported that Indonesia
      had “received an official request from Moscow, seeking permission for Russian
      Aerospace Forces (VKS) aircraft to be based at a facility in [the country’s] easternmost
      province.” The area in question is Papua, and the relevant airbase, Biak Numfor,
      home to the Indonesian Air Force’s Aviation Squadron 27 responsible for operating
      surveillance aircraft of the CN235 variety.


      Indonesian government sources had informed the magazine of a request received
      by the office of the defense minister, Sjafrie Sjamsoeddin, following a February
      meeting with the Security Council of the Russian Federation Sergei Shoigu. This
      was not the first time, with Moscow making previous requests to Jakarta for using
      a base for its long-range aircraft.


      The frazzled response in Australia to the possibility of a Russian presence on
      Indonesian soil betrays its presumption. Just as Australia would rather not see
      Pacific Island states form security friendly ties with China, an anxiety directed
      and dictated by Washington, it would also wish those in Southeast Asia to avoid
      the feelers of other countries supposedly unfriendly to Canberra’s interests.


      Opposition leader, Peter Dutton, who has an addict’s fascination with security
      menaces of the phantom variety, sprung at the claims made in Janes. “This would
      be a catastrophic failure of diplomatic relations if [Australian Foreign Minister]
      Penny Wong and [Prime Minister] Anthony Albanese didn’t have forewarning about
      this before it was made public,” he trumpeted. “This is a very, very troubling
      development and suggestion that somehow Russia would have some of their assets
      based in Indonesia only a short distance from, obviously, the north of our country.”


      The Albanese government has tried to cool the confected heat with assurances,
      with the PM reaffirming Canberra’s support for Ukraine while stating that “we
      obviously do not want to see Russian influence in our region”. It has also accused
      Dutton for a streaky fabrication: that Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto had
      “publicly announced” the details.


      Australia’s Defence Minister, Richard Marles, also informed the press that he
      had spoken to his counterpart Sjamsoeddin, who duly replied “in the clearest possible
      terms [that] reports of the prospect of Russian aircraft operating from Indonesia
      are simply not true.”


      Besides, a country such as Indonesia, according to Marles, is of the friendly
      sort. “We have a growing defence relationship with Indonesia. We will keep engaging
      with Indonesia in a way that befits a very close friend and a very close friendship
      between our two countries.” This sweetly coated nonsense should have gone out
      with the façade-tearing acts of Donald Trump’s global imposition of tariffs, unsparing
      to adversaries and allies alike.


      Marles continues to operate in a certain twilight of international relations,
      under the belief that the defense cooperation agreement with Jakarta “is the deepest
      level defense agreement we’ve ever had with Indonesia, and we are seeking increasing
      cooperation between Australia and Indonesia at the defense level.” Whether this
      is, the case hardly precludes Indonesia, as an important regional power, from
      conducting defense and foreign policy on its own terms with countries of its own
      choosing.


      In January, Jakarta officially added its name to the BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India,
      China, South Africa) group, an alternative power alignment that has been foolishly
      disregarded in terms of significance by the United States and its satellites.
      Subianto’s coming to power last October has also heralded a warmer turn to Moscow
      in military terms, with both countries conducting their first joint naval drills
      last November in the Java Sea near Surabaya. (Indonesia is already a market for
      Russian fighter jets, despite the cloud of potential sanctions from the US Treasury
      Department.) For doing so, self-appointed disciplinarians, notably such pro-US
      outlets as the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, have questioned the country’s
      fabled non-aligned foreign policy. Engaging Russia in cooperative military terms
      supposedly undermined, according to the think tank’s publication The Strategist,
      Jakarta’s “own stated commitment to upholding international law.”


      Such commentary is neither here nor there. The Indonesian military remains jealous
      and proprietary, taking a dim view of any notion of a foreign military base. Retired
      Major General TB Hasanuddin, who is also a Member of Commission I of the Indonesian
      House of Representatives, points to constitutional and other legal impediments
      in permitting such a policy. “Our constitution and various laws and regulations
      expressly prohibit the existence of foreign military bases.”


      Any criticism of Jakarta’s recent gravitation to Moscow also refuses to acknowledge
      the flexible, even sly approach Indonesia has taken to various powers. It has
      done so while maintaining a firm independence of mind. In the afterglow of the
      naval exercises with the Russian Navy, Indonesia’s armed forces merrily went about
      the business of conducting military exercises with Australia, named Keris Woomera.
      Between November 13 and 16 last year, the exercise comprised 2,000 personnel from
      the navy, army and air force from both countries. As Australia frets and fantasizes
      about the stratagems of distant authoritarian leaders, Indonesia has the last
      laugh.'
    one_sentence_summary: Australia's anxiety over potential Russian military presence
      in Indonesia reflects its broader fears of foreign influence in the region, despite
      assurances from Indonesian officials that such reports are unfounded and the country's
      commitment to maintaining its independence in foreign relations.
    paragraph_summary: Island states like Australia often exhibit heightened political
      anxiety due to their geographical isolation and perceived threats from external
      powers. Recently, concerns have arisen in Australia regarding a reported request
      from Russia to base military aircraft in Indonesia, which has sparked alarm among
      Australian leaders, particularly opposition figures like Peter Dutton. The Albanese
      government has attempted to downplay these fears, asserting that such reports
      are unfounded and emphasizing the strong defense relationship between Australia
      and Indonesia. Despite Australia’s apprehensions about Russian influence in the
      region, Indonesia has been pursuing a more independent foreign policy, engaging
      with various powers, including Russia, while also maintaining military cooperation
      with Australia. This situation reflects Indonesia's strategic balancing act and
      its commitment to its own sovereignty, as it navigates relationships with major
      global players without succumbing to external pressures.

  - title: Perfume, Power and Emmanuel Macron
    url: https://www.counterpunch.org/2025/04/15/perfume-power-and-emmanuel-macron/
    text: 'Apparently, he is addicted to it. The French President, Emmanuel Macron,
      adores using perfume. The variety: Dior Eau Sauvage. Dior states that the perfume
      is characterised by notes of Calabrian bergamot and Papua New Guinean vanilla
      extract. The company is also keen to glorify elements of power and nobility in
      the scent.


      Apparently, the use of that particular fragrance by the France’s head of state
      happens to be “industrial” in application, “at all hours of the day”, intended
      to impress “less-accustomed visitors” with “the floral and musky scent, as refined
      as it is powerful.” A former aide is quoted as claiming that the President’s use
      is far from subtle, a way of “marking his territory”. Former minister Stanislas
      Guerini is also found stating that “everyone holds their breath for a few moments
      before [his] arrival.” That’s if we believe the findings of Le Parisien journalist
      Olivier Beaumont in The Tragedy of the Élysée (La Tragédie de L’Élysée).


      The field of scent and odours teems with what might be loosely called analysis
      of the self-evident and palpably obvious. Scent is worn for calculated reasons:
      for impression, the pursuit of sex, an expression of power. An article in Women’s
      Wear Daily from June 1990 is pungent with examples, much of it featuring garden
      gnome psychology. “Those who select a different fragrance for every occasion use
      scents as a means of shaping their social image,” Mark Snyder, a professor of
      psychology at the University of Minnesota is quoted as saying. “All odors trigger
      an emotional response,” one Susan Schiffman, medical psychologist at Duke University
      blandly states.


      According to the book, Macron’s choice of fragrant dousing is driven by power
      – and ensuring that everyone else working with him knows about it. “Just as Louis
      XIV made his perfumes an attribute of power when he paraded through the galleries
      of Versailles, Emmanuel Macron uses his as an element of his authority at the
      Élysée.”


      These revelations about Macron’s excessive use have caused something of a ripple.
      “It is one thing at a school dance or nightclub when you are a horny teen,” writes
      Zoe Strimpel in The Spectator. “Outside of these contexts, it can be a nauseating,
      terrible thing.” The Daily Telegraph dives into the shallow currents of social
      media to use the term“blusher blindness”, meant to signify “an inability to objectively
      gauge how much blusher one is applying – often resulting in overly roughed cheeks.”


      Tips are offered for Macron with unasked, hollow generosity, many amounting to
      a shoddy excuse to plump for preferred products. (The “Mr President Could Do Far
      Better” discipline.) Fragrance journalist (they do exist), Alice du Parcq is more
      than up to the task. “Scent can be truly very potent, so if you’re spending time
      in close proximity to a lot of other people you should be a little more gentle
      with your approach,” she chides. Avoid, she advocates, spraying on wrists. Why
      not the top of each forearm? “This makes the scent last longer as it’s less likely
      to come off every time you wash your hands.” The fragrance lingers, as “the skin
      is more textured and it also clings to an arm hair, which is porous.”


      The advertising note emerges from the opinions of Thomas Dunckley, who markets
      himself as “fragrance expert, writer, trainer, event host and speaker”. He suggests
      that products less concentrated in fragrance oils might be appropriate when seeking
      a balance. “An eau de cologne is a good way for a man to wear a pleasant fragrance
      without making a statement or overpowering.” He throws in the recommended products:
      Eau de Guerlain and Acqua di Parma.


      The disciplinarian view is most evident in the commentary that accuses the French
      leader of revealing a character fault. As with one of his predecessors, Nicolas
      Sarkozy, size and stature are matters of comment regarding Macron, implying that
      a manufactured defect requires remedies of exaggeration. Small men demand large
      substitutes, broad covers, gargantuan distractions. The spare frame will not do.


      If one has to use perfume, suggests Strimpel, why not do so differently? “A French
      leader might, one would think, go for something more openly, proudly elite, since
      he is not hamstrung by the modern British obsession with appearing to be one of
      the people,” she squawks. A fault is swiftly detected: immaturity. Perhaps Macron
      confused his abode of power with the school where he met his wife, Brigitte, “planting
      the seed (or perhaps it was the scent?) that would eventually lead her to return
      his passion.”


      The fragrance analysts and perfumeries will be delighted to know that a head of
      state is so enamoured with a specific product. Those wishing to make a fuss about
      workplace attitudes and dispositions will also add, and have added, their worthless
      observations. Ultimately, the use, or otherwise, of French power would not come
      down to a fragrance but a decision marked by other considerations. The fragrance
      cabal and tabloid titterers may have you think otherwise.'
    one_sentence_summary: French President Emmanuel Macron's excessive use of Dior Eau
      Sauvage perfume, described as a means of asserting power and influence, has sparked
      debate about its appropriateness and implications for his image.
    paragraph_summary: French President Emmanuel Macron has developed a notable fondness
      for the Dior Eau Sauvage perfume, reportedly applying it "industrial" amounts
      throughout the day to create a powerful impression on visitors. This choice of
      fragrance, characterized by its floral and musky notes, is seen as a deliberate
      strategy to assert authority, reminiscent of Louis XIV's use of scent as a symbol
      of power. Critics have pointed out the potential excessiveness of Macron's application,
      comparing it to behaviors more suited to youthful social settings, and suggesting
      that he might consider more subtle alternatives. Commentary surrounding this habit
      has sparked discussions about the implications of scent in social and political
      contexts, with some analysts interpreting Macron's fragrance choice as a reflection
      of deeper character traits and insecurities. Ultimately, while fragrance experts
      offer tips for moderation, the article suggests that the essence of leadership
      transcends mere scent.

  - title: 'Junk Science and Bad Policing: The Homicide Prediction Project'
    url: https://www.counterpunch.org/2025/04/14/junk-science-and-bad-policing-the-homicide-prediction-project/
    text: 'The law enforcement breed can be a pretty dark lot. To be paid to think suspiciously
      leaves its mark, fostering an incentive to identify crimes and misdemeanours with
      instinctive compulsion. Historically, this saw the emergence of quackery and bogus
      attempts to identify criminal tendencies. Craniometry and skull size was, for
      a time, an attractive pursuit for the aspiring crime hunter and lunatic sleuth.
      The crime fit the skull.


      With the onset of facial recognition technologies, we are seeing the same old
      habits appear, with their human creators struggling to identify the best means
      of eliminating compromising biases. A paper published by IBM researchers in April
      2019 titled “Diversity in Faces” shows that doing so ends up returning to old
      grounds of quackery, including the use of “craniofacial distances, areas and ratios,
      facial symmetry and contrast, skin color, age and gender predictions, subjective
      annotations, and pose and resolution.”


      The emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) tools in identifying a form of predictive
      criminality perpetuates similar sins. Police, to that end, have consistently shown
      themselves unable to resist the attractions supposedly offered by data programs
      and algorithmic orderings, however sophisticated. These can take such crude forms
      as those advanced by Pasco County Sheriff Chris Nocco, a devotee of that oxymoronic
      pursuit “intelligence-led policing,” stacked with its snake oil properties. A
      2020 Tampa Bay Times piece on the exploits of that Florida county’s sheriff’s
      office made it clear that Nocco was keen on creating “a cutting-edge intelligence
      program that could stop crime before it happened.”


      The counter to this was impressive in its savagery. Such forms of law enforcement
      featured, in the view of criminologist David Kennedy of the John Jay College of
      Criminal Justice, “One of the worst manifestations of the intersection of junk
      science and bad policing”, in addition to its utter lack of “common sense and
      humanity”.


      The trend towards data heavy systems that supposedly offer insight into inherent,
      potential criminality has captured police departments in numerous countries. A
      recommendation paper from the European Crime Prevention Network notes the use
      of “AI tools in hopes of rendering law enforcement more effective and cost-efficient”
      across the European Union. Predictive policing is singled out as particularly
      attractive, notably as a response to smaller budgets and fewer staff.


      In the United Kingdom, the government’s Ministry of Justice has taken to AI with
      gusto through the Homicide Prediction Project, a pilot program that hoovers up
      data from police and government data sets to generate profiles and assess the
      risk of a person committing murder. The program, commissioned by the Prime Minister’s
      Office in 2023 and involving the MoJ, the Home Office, Greater Manchester Police
      (GMP) and the Metropolitan Police in London, only came to light because of a Freedom
      of Information request by the charity Statewatch.


      According to the Data and Analysis unit within the MoJ the data science program
      explores “the power of MOJ datasets in relation to assessment of homicide risk”,
      the “additional power of the Police National Computer dataset” in doing the same,
      and “the additional power of local police data”. It also seeks to review the characteristics
      of offenders that increase such a risk, exploring “alternative and innovative
      data science techniques to risk assessment and homicide.”


      What stands out in the program is the type of data shared between the agencies.
      These include types of criminal convictions, the age a person first appeared as
      a victim (this includes domestic violence), and the age a person had their first
      encounter with the police. But also included are such matters as “health markers
      which are expected to have predictive power”, be they on mental health, addiction
      issues, suicide, self-harm and disability.


      The use of predictive models is far from new for the wonks at the MoJ. Those used
      in the Offender Assessment System (OASys) have been previously found to profile
      people differently in accordance with their ethnicities. The National Offender
      Management service noted in a 2015 compendium of research and analysis of the
      system between 2009 and 2013, “Relative predictive validity was greater for female
      than male offenders, for White offenders than offenders of Asian, Black and Mixed
      ethnicity, and for older than younger offenders.”


      Statewatch researcher Sofia Lyall has little to recommend the program, renamed
      for evidently more palatable consumption the Sharing Data to Improve Risk Assessment
      program. “Time and again, research shows that algorithmic systems for ‘predicting’
      crime are inherently flawed.” The Homicide Prediction Project was “chilling and
      dystopian”, profiling individuals “as criminals before they have done anything.”
      She is also convinced that the system will, as with others, “code in bias towards
      racialized and low-income communities” while posing grave threats to privacy.


      The unit claims that the work is only intended for dry research purposes, with
      “no direct operational or policy changes” arising because of it, or any individual
      application to a “person’s journey through the justice system.” This is a nonsensical
      assertion, given the sheer temptations open to officials to implement a program
      that uses hefty data sets in order to ease the task of rigorous policing. The
      representatives of law enforcement crave results, even those poorly arrived at,
      and algorithmic expediency and actuarial fantasy is there to aid them. The “precrime”
      dystopia portrayed in Philip K. Dick’s The Minority Report (1956) is well on its
      way to being realised.'
    one_sentence_summary: The article critiques the resurgence of flawed predictive
      policing methods, such as facial recognition and AI-driven risk assessments, which
      echo historical quackery and risk perpetuating biases against marginalized communities,
      ultimately warning that these technologies could lead to a dystopian reality reminiscent
      of "precrime" scenarios.
    paragraph_summary: The article critiques the troubling trend of law enforcement
      agencies increasingly relying on artificial intelligence and predictive policing
      technologies to identify potential criminality, echoing historical practices of
      pseudoscience like craniometry. It highlights the risks associated with these
      data-driven approaches, including the perpetuation of biases against marginalized
      communities, as seen in the UK’s Homicide Prediction Project, which utilizes extensive
      datasets to assess homicide risk. Critics argue that such programs, despite claims
      of being for research purposes only, could lead to preemptive profiling and exacerbate
      existing inequalities in the justice system. The piece warns that the allure of
      algorithmic solutions may lead to a dystopian reality reminiscent of the "precrime"
      concept in Philip K. Dick's "The Minority Report," where individuals are deemed
      criminals before committing any offenses.

    url: https://www.counterpunch.org/2025/04/10/killing-paramedics-israels-war-on-palestinian-health/
    text: 'It was a massacre. Fifteen emergency workers, butchered in cold blood by
      personnel from the Israeli Defense Forces in southern Gaza on March 23. It all
      came to light from a video that the IDF did not intend anyone to see, filmed by
      Red Crescent paramedic Rifaat Radwan in the last minutes of his life. Caught red
      handed, the wires and levers of justification, mendacity and qualification began
      to move.


      The pattern of institutional response is a well-rehearsed one. First came the
      official claim that the troops only opened fire because the convoy approached
      them “suspiciously”, enshrouded in darkness, with no headlights or evidence of
      flashing lights. The movement of the convoy had not, it was said, been cleared
      and coordinated with the IDF, which had been alerted by operators of an overhead
      UAV. Soldiers had previously fired on a car containing, according to the Israeli
      account, three Hamas members. When that vehicle was approached by the ambulances,
      IDF personnel assumed they were threatened, despite lacking any evidence that
      the emergency workers were armed. On exiting the vehicles, gunfire ensues. Radwan’s
      final words: “The Israelis are coming, the Israeli soldiers are coming.”


      Then comes the qualification, the “hand in the cookie jar” retort. With the video
      now very public, the IDF was forced to admit that they had been mistaken in the
      initial assessment that the lights of the ambulance convoy had been switched off,
      blaming it on the sketchy testimony of soldiers. Also evident are clear markings
      on the vehicles, with the paramedics wearing hi-vis uniforms.


      After being shot, the bodies of the 15 dead workers were unceremoniously buried
      in sand (“in a brutal and disregarding manner that violates human dignity,” according
      to the Red Crescent) – supposedly to protect them from the ravages of wildlife
      – with the vehicles crushed by an armoured D9 bulldozer to clear the road. Allegations
      have been made that some of the bodies had their hands tied and were shot at close
      range, suggesting a willingness on the part of the military to conceal their misdeeds.
      The IDF has countered by claiming that the UN was informed on the location of
      the bodies.


      The Palestinian Red Crescent society is adamant: the paramedics were shot with
      the clear intention of slaying them. “We cannot disclose everything we know,”
      stated Dr. Younis Al-Khatib, president of the Red Crescent in the West Bank, “but
      I will say that all the martyrs were shot in the upper part of their bodies, with
      the intent to kill.”


      The IDF, after a breezy inquiry, claimed that it “revealed that the force opened
      fire due to a sense of threat following a previous exchange of fire in the area.
      Also, six Hamas terrorists were identified among those killed in the incident.”
      This hardly dispels the reality that those shot were unarmed and showed no hostile
      intent. The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) and
      Palestinian rescuers have offered a breakdown of those killed: eight staff members
      from the Red Crescent, six from the Palestinian Civil Defence, and one employee
      from the UN agency for Palestinian refugees UNRWA.


      The OCHA insists that the first team comprised rescuers rather than Hamas operatives.
      On being sought by additional paramedic and emergency personnel, they, too, were
      attacked by the IDF.


      The findings of the probe into the killings were presented on April 7 to the IDF
      Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Eyal Zamir by the chief of the Southern Command, Maj.
      Gen. Yaniv Asor. On doing so, Zamir then ordered that the General Staff Fact-Finding
      Assessment Mechanism be used to “deepen and complete” the effort. That particular
      fact-finding body is risibly described as independent, despite being an extension
      of the IDF. Self-investigation remains a standard norm for allegations of impropriety.


      Since October 7, 2023, the death toll of health workers in the Gaza Strip has
      been impressively grim, reaching 1,060. Health facilities have been destroyed,
      with hundreds of attacks launched on health services. The World Health Organization
      update in February found that a mere 50% of hospitals were partially functional.
      Primary health care facilities were found to be 41% functional. Medical personnel
      have been harassed, arbitrarily detained and subjected to mistreatment. A report
      from Healthcare Workers Watch published in February identified 384 cases of unlawful
      detention since October 7, 2023, with 339 coming from the Gaza Strip and 45 from
      the West Bank.


      In the opinion of the UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in
      the Palestinian territories since 1967, Francesca Albanese, “This is part of a
      pattern by Israel to continuously bombard, destroy and fully annihilate the realisation
      of the right to health in Gaza.”


      The IDF, which claims to be fastidious in observing the canons of international
      law, continues to dispel such notions in killing civilians and health workers.
      It also continues to insist that its soldiers could never be guilty of a conscious
      massacre, culpable for a blatant crime. The bodies of fifteen health workers suggest
      otherwise.'
    one_sentence_summary: On March 23, 2023, fifteen emergency workers were killed by
      Israeli Defense Forces in southern Gaza, an incident revealed by a video that
      contradicted the IDF's initial claims of self-defense, raising serious concerns

      violence in the region.

      the unmarked ambulance convoy posed a threat after a previous exchange of fire.
      However, the video contradicted this narrative, showing the paramedics were clearly
      identifiable and unarmed. Following the incident, the bodies were buried in a
      disrespectful manner, raising allegations of a cover-up, including claims that
      some victims had been shot at close range with their hands tied. The Palestinian
      Red Crescent asserted that the workers were deliberately targeted, while the IDF
      maintained that some of those killed were Hamas operatives, despite evidence to
      the contrary. This incident is part of a broader pattern of violence against health
      workers in Gaza, where over 1,060 have died since October 2023, and health facilities
      have been severely damaged. The UN and various humanitarian organizations have
      criticized the IDF's actions, highlighting a systematic violation of the right

  - title: Holding Meta Accountable in Africa
    url: https://www.counterpunch.org/2025/04/07/holding-meta-accountable-in-africa/
    text: 'It was yet another unwelcome development for Mark Zuckerberg’s technology
      titan Meta, the parent company of Facebook. The High Court of Kenya has found
      that the US-based entity can be sued over its alleged role in disseminating content
      that incited violence in neighbouring Ethiopia. While the case can be heard in
      Kenya, the essential harm is alleged to have taken place during the 2020-2022
      civil war in Ethiopia’s northern region of Tigray.


      Ethiopians Abrham Meareg and Fisseha Tekle, the latter a former Amnesty International
      researcher, along with The Katiba Institute, charge Meta with promoting harmful
      content from November 2020 to November 2022. Meareg, alleges that his father Meareg
      Amare Abrha, an academic then in the employ of Bahir Dar University, was killed
      outside his home in 2021 in the saturating aftermath of threatening, inciting
      posts on Facebook. These included details about where he lived, along with false
      allegations of corruption and the provision of assistance to the Tigrayan People’s
      Liberation Front. Tekle, for his part, faced a hail of hateful posts and activity
      on Facebook for his human rights work in Ethiopia.


      As cited in the ruling by High Court judge Lawrence Mugambi, the petitioners also
      make various other arguments. One is that Meta’s “Facebook algorithm recommends
      content that amounts to propaganda for war, incitement to violence and advocacy
      to the Facebook users in Kenya.” Meta is also accused of “granting preferential
      treatment to users in other countries as opposed to Facebook users in Africa”,
      thereby making it discriminative in nature. “The darker the content,” the petition
      asserts, “the higher the likelihood it will be prioritized.”


      The petitioners demand that Meta make a formal apology for the killing of Meareg
      Amare Abrhal and establish a restitution fund for victims of hate speech and incitement
      on Facebook to the value of 250 billion KSH (US$2 billion), with an additional
      50 billion KSH (US$400 million) for harm arising from sponsored posts. The company
      is to also alter Facebook’s algorithm to halt the promotion of viral hate and
      adjust the algorithm in favour of demoting incitements to violence, including
      death threats and doxing. This would be along lines similar to what was adopted
      in the aftermath of the US Capitol riots of January 6, 2021.


      Important here is also the demand that Meta ensure the recruitment of sufficient
      numbers of content moderators for Facebook to guard against any repetition of
      those harms caused in East and Southeastern Africa, with particular attention
      paid to Ethiopia.


      The argument by Meta was a tried and failed one. Kenyan courts, it argued, could
      not hear the case, as Meta was not a Kenyan company. It had contended that the
      Kenyan Constitution had no extraterritorial reach and could not be said to apply
      to events taking place in Ethiopia. Nor did it have a base of operation in Kenya.
      Any relevant claim, accordingly, could only be heard in the US judicial system.


      The Court found, however, that it was empowered to determine whether rights protected
      under the Kenyan Bill of Rights were breached, even in the novel circumstances
      posed by the use of artificial intelligence. It followed that the petition raised
      “substantial questions of law”, thereby satisfying the threshold requirements
      of the Constitution.


      As the ruling goes on to mention, “The issues raised are substantial and transcend
      the interests of the parties involved in the Petition. These are matters of general
      public importance relating to the protection of fundamental rights and freedoms
      in the digital era.” An uneven number of judges, as stipulated by section 165
      of the Constitution of Kenya, will be empanelled by Chief Justice Martha Koome,
      even as Meta’s legal representatives seek to appeal the decision.


      Lawyers representing the company should have known better. The jurisdictional
      argument has been run in two separate cases involving the unlawful sacking of
      content moderators working for Facebook in Kenya in 2022 and 2023. Kenyan courts
      have given short shrift to claims that they lack jurisdiction no less than three
      times. To this can be added defeats for Meta in the Employment and Labour Relations
      Court and the Court of Appeal. This particular High Court ruling is notable for,
      in its words, helping identify “a clear jurisprudential path that ensures observance
      of human rights in a borderless digital community.”


      Nora Mbagathi, executive director of the Katiba Institute, underlined the salience
      of the decision: “The court here has refused to shy away from determining an important
      global matter, recognising that homegrown issues must be addressed directly by
      our courts.” Abrham Meareg also had sharp words for Zuckerberg, who “may imagine
      that justice begins and ends at the US border.” It is yet another example of holding
      the conduct of tech behemoths to account for the convulsive information ecosystem
      they have so blithely created and exploited.'
    one_sentence_summary: The High Court of Kenya has ruled that Meta, the parent company
      of Facebook, can be sued for its alleged role in promoting violent content during
      Ethiopia's civil war, allowing a case that claims the platform incited violence
      and hate speech, leading to significant harm, including the death of an academic.
    paragraph_summary: The High Court of Kenya has ruled that Meta, the parent company
      of Facebook, can be sued for its alleged role in spreading content that incited
      violence during Ethiopia's civil war from 2020 to 2022. The case, brought by Ethiopians
      Abrham Meareg and Fisseha Tekle, claims that Meta's platform facilitated harmful
      posts that led to violence, including the killing of Meareg's father. The petitioners
      accuse Meta of promoting incendiary content through its algorithms and discriminating
      against African users. They demand a formal apology, a restitution fund for victims,
      algorithm changes to reduce hate speech, and increased content moderation in the
      region. Meta's argument that Kenyan courts lacked jurisdiction was rejected, with
      the court emphasizing the importance of protecting fundamental rights in the digital
      age. This ruling highlights the accountability of tech companies for their impact
      on global information ecosystems.
