summary: |
  As of July 9, 2025, the international landscape remains marked by escalating tensions, persistent narratives, and calls for deeper understanding across geopolitical divides. Recent independent analyses highlight three key developments: Western perceptions of China, ongoing U.S. policy towards Cuba and peace activism, and the aftermath of the Gaza People’s Tribunal.
  
  The forthcoming anthology "If You Want To Understand China," announced by the Transnational Foundation in Sweden, seeks to challenge the entrenched negative portrayals of China in Western political, economic, and media discourse. **Jan Oberg** underscores the anthology’s aim to foster a more nuanced understanding, warning that current one-sided narratives carry "critical and potentially dangerous implications." This initiative reflects a broader trend among independent scholars to question mainstream Western framing of China, advocating for dialogue over confrontation.
  
  Meanwhile, the climate for peace activists in the United States has come under scrutiny following the closure of World BEYOND War’s bank accounts after its member, David Swanson, attended a peace conference in Cuba. **Swanson** describes the incident as symptomatic of a "broader climate of fear and repression," likening it to a new era of McCarthyism. He calls for transparency and collective action against such measures, which he argues are rooted in longstanding U.S. hostility toward Cuba and serve to stifle dissent and peace advocacy.
  
  In the Middle East, the Gaza People’s Tribunal has issued the Sarajevo Declaration, emphasizing the Palestinian right to self-determination and calling for international solidarity. **Richard Falk**, a TFF Associate, urges widespread endorsement of the declaration, framing it as a pivotal step in the pursuit of justice and peace for Palestinians. This initiative signals a growing civil society movement seeking to influence international discourse and policy on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
  
  Looking ahead, the prevailing trends suggest a continued polarization in Western narratives about China, with independent voices pushing for greater balance and understanding. The repression of peace activism in the U.S. is likely to persist, given the entrenched security mindset and political sensitivities around Cuba. Civil society efforts, such as the Gaza People’s Tribunal, are expected to gain traction, but their impact on official policy remains uncertain.
  
  Based on the current trajectory, I, **Jan Oberg**, assess with high confidence that unless there is a fundamental shift in Western approaches—particularly regarding China and the Middle East—tensions and misunderstandings will most definitely persist, with civil society initiatives playing a critical but limited role in shaping outcomes.

      World BEYOND War,


      TFF Associate


      June 17, 2025


      For years, World BEYOND War and other peace groups from around the world had been
      attending peace conferences in Cuba. When I visited Cuba this past January it
      was with a visa for that purpose. I published here the remarks I made at the conference.
      We shouted as loudly as we could about January’s conference in websites, social
      media, emails, and media interviews. The notion that there could be anything wrong
      with it — or that some institution could punish us for it — never entered our
      minds.


      Legally, you’re allowed to go to a peace conference in Cuba. Nobody has so much
      as hinted that I’ve done anything illegal. But on Thursday June 5th I got a bunch
      of letters in the mail telling me that on Monday June 9th the U.S. bank accounts
      of World BEYOND War and the private accounts of all of my family members would
      be closed without explanation. This was the action of a particular bank called
      First Citizens, with no indication of any involvement by any government. (The
      explanation, it would be made clear, was my visit to Cuba.)


      Morally, it seems a useful thing to do — attending peace conferences in Cuba.
      As at similar conferences in many other countries, one can meet diplomats, authors,
      activists, and politicians from all over the world to discuss peace education,
      disarmament, negotiations, and cross-cultural understanding. Videos of the entire
      conferences in Cuba, like most others around the world, are posted online for
      all to see.


      World BEYOND War works to abolish all war, and opposes all sides of all wars —
      an unusual position even at peace conferences. We are constantly working to persuade
      some people not to support the Russian side of a war and other people not to support
      the Ukrainian side. We oppose any and all war-making by the U.S., Cuba, or anyone
      else, without equating disparate sides or blaming victims in any actual wars.
      Some groups try to shut down weapons programs because the weapons don’t work well;
      we start with opposing those that kill the most. When Trump sends troops into
      Los Angeles, we don’t join the Governor of California in asking that soldiers
      and Marines do their work abroad; we ask people to think about whether such armed
      forces should invade anyone else’s city either. The nice thing about peace conferences
      is that we can advance these views nonviolently, disagreeing amicably.


      The problem, apparently, for a U.S. bank, with Cuban peace conferences is that,
      as with many things in Cuba, the Cuban government is involved. The president of
      the country wanders into the panel sessions. While that has the potential to cause
      censorship, it also has the potential to educate decision makers. I’d like to
      see presidents wandering in at peace conferences in Washington and other capitals.


      Of course, the U.S. government has been sanctioning and blockading Cuba for generations,
      for the stated illegal purpose of overthrowing the government but — as usual —
      with the result of strengthening it instead, and the actual illegal impact of
      impoverishing the Cuban people — whose impoverishment is then blamed on the Cuban
      government and used as an excuse to overthrow it. This cruelty from the North
      provides a handy excuse for all sorts of repression and awful governance by the
      Cuban government, just as with the Iranian government and several others.


      But U.S. policies have been tweaked in recent decades. Policies toward Cuba were
      somewhat moderated when Barack Obama was U.S. president, and then returned to
      the bad old days during the Trump-Biden-Trump era — although, Biden did (in defiance
      of understanding) take Cuba off the list of countries not fully cooperating with
      the U.S. on opposing terrorism, while leaving Cuba on the U.S. list of countries
      supposedly sponsoring terrorism. Despite his campaign promises (or because of
      his devotion to consistently reversing them?) Biden’s Cuba policies were basically
      Trump’s.


      What had changed between Obama and Trump? The U.S. has not offered any reason
      for keeping Cuba on a list of nations sponsoring terrorism. One would think that
      Cuba would have had to, you know, sponsor some terrorism. Formally and legally,
      there’s nothing there, but in media commentary, 2016 was not just the year of
      electing Trump, and the year of concocting Russiagate, but also the year in which
      the so-called Havana Syndrome was first diagnosed. That the U.S. government itself
      doubts the very existence of this syndrome and has never connected it to the Cuban
      government is beside the point. There’s a buzz about Cuba and something nefarious.
      And there’s an equally amorphous license to act.


      On June 7, a U.S. television channel broadcast a live Broadway production of a
      play about the McCarthy red scare. In it, George Clooney, playing Edward R. Murrow,
      told someone that a new disturbing incident should be part of their news coverage.
      When told that the incident wasn’t an action by Senator McCarthy, Morrow replied
      “Isn’t it?”


      Perhaps the U.S. government is ordering banks to do what they do and to keep quiet
      about those orders. If not, what’s at work is probably just the climate — a McCarthyite
      climate of wild accusations, firings, disappearances, deportations, military in
      the streets, and peace advocacy transformed into the new “communism,” now called
      “anti-Semitism.”


      “Have you ever attended a meeting with any member of the Communist Party?” “Have
      you ever suggested that genocide in Gaza should cease?” These are not questions
      but threats. Formally, First Citizens BancShares has not told us in writing why
      we cannot sit at its lunch counter, and claims it does not have to. But here’s
      what we know:


      World BEYOND War has publicly announced everything we’ve done for years. No employee
      of First Citizens has ever given any indication of knowing that or of having glanced
      at our website beyond pages we’ve directed them to in answering their questions.


      When I was in Cuba, I tried to look at our account on the First Citizens website
      and was blocked from doing so. When I got back to the United States I was still
      blocked. I spoke with someone at First Citizens who demanded to see my airline
      tickets, after which, on February 3, she said they would reactivate my account.
      This was just the World BEYOND War account. There would be no mention of personal
      or family members’ accounts until they were shut down five months later.


      On March 17, the bank sent this absurd set of questions about what business our
      nonprofit organization supposedly does in certain countries. We filled it out
      and returned it. Our answer to most of the questions was “None.”


      On March 28, they emailed: “My team has a follow-up question for you. Can you
      please provide insight to the following: Please advise if World Beyond War chapters
      in Belarus, Cyprus, Pakistan, Ukraine and Venezuela, operate as independent entities,
      from World Beyond War, much like your website indicates is the case for the Afghanistan
      chapter? If this is not the case please provide additional detail/nature of the
      operating relationship, pertaining to each country.” We replied the same day (and
      pointed out that all but one of those chapters did not exist), and then heard
      nothing until we received those letters on June 5th.


      Phone calls and emails on June 5th produced nothing helpful, so I went in-person
      to a nearby branch of the bank — not the most local one, the one that had put
      up a pretense of being human and accountable years before, prior to massive growth
      and corporatization and increasingly referrals of customers with questions to
      a distant headquarters. I met with two bank employees who were super friendly
      and who (it seemed) immediately upon discovering that I existed in the flesh decided
      the whole thing was an outrage that they would get to the bottom of.


      One of them clicked and stared and clicked at their computer, and informed me
      that the people in the bank’s “Fraud and Risk” department believed I worked for
      the Cuban government. I asked her if it mattered that I never had and never would
      work for the Cuban government. She said they’d take care of it, and that in any
      event nothing would be done to our accounts soon without ample warning.


      Later that day, she emailed: “I hope you are doing well! I spoke to our internal
      department, and we will not be able to keep the accounts opened including the
      accounts for your family members. On the 10th we will be closing the accounts
      and mailing cashiers checks via certified mail. Please let me know if you have
      any additional questions.”


      They’d moved the date by one day. I had lots of additional questions, but got
      no answers.


      Was it all about Cuba or had they discovered we opposed genocide? Or was it something
      else entirely?


      Was the U.S. government threatening the bank, or was the bank just being careful,
      or was the bank just feeling empowered to act on the rightwing whims of its owners?


      Was there somewhere some poor deluded soul who actually believed I was endangering
      them, that I might cause them to catch Havana Syndrome or something, but that
      such a deed would require more than the six months they’d spent contemplating
      giving us a few days’ notice?


      We never got any other communication from the bank that it wouldn’t close our
      accounts on the 10th, by which date we’d managed to get the balances at or near
      zero. But it didn’t actually close the accounts until June 16th (sure would have
      been great to have known that was the plan a week earlier).


      As this particular bank has grown worse over the years, other banks we’ve worked
      with and are newly trying to work with have grown — or we are hoping have grown
      — better, in terms of online tools, and in terms of divesting their money from
      the most horrible industries. World BEYOND War has never had much, and usually
      not any, money to invest in anything. We try to spend it all on our work. But
      we highly recommend trying to avoid having anything at all to do with a bank like
      First Citizens. One can only imagine how this bank treats non-citizens.


      Friends are being shot at in Los Angeles, having their boats boarded by Israeli
      troops, risking starvation as they fast for peace, seeing their loved ones snatched
      and imprisoned for no reason. When World BEYOND War asked friendly organizations
      if they might help out in our little banking crisis, each one we asked was too
      scared or too busy with its own crises. Some said they didn’t want to be tainted
      by us. The fact that we’d done nothing wrong was irrelevant.


      Could I expect some other nonprofit to risk its existence for ours? Of course
      not. Could I expect friendly local bank employees to risk their jobs by standing
      up to their corporate Pinkertons? Of course not. But can I go silent and fearful
      and not denounce and expose any part of this disturbing trend that I’m able to
      warn others about? Of course not.


      Just normal existence these days requires calculating risks and some modicum of
      courage. It’s a safe prediction that if we slant our calculations a bit more away
      from cowardice, toward openness and decency, the outcome will be far preferable.


      If you’d like to politely and reasonably let First Citizens know that you do not
      approve of its behavior please phone 866-322-4249 or email.'

      detailing how the U.S. bank First Citizens closed their accounts, allegedly due

    paragraph_summary: David Swanson, a member of World BEYOND War, recounts his experience
      attending peace conferences in Cuba and the subsequent closure of his organization’s
      bank accounts by First Citizens Bank, which he believes was a reaction to his
      visit. Despite attending these conferences legally and promoting peace initiatives,
      Swanson suggests that the bank's actions reflect a broader climate of fear and
      repression in the U.S., reminiscent of McCarthyism. He criticizes U.S. policies
      toward Cuba, which have oscillated between moderation and hostility, and highlights
      the challenges faced by peace advocates in a politically charged environment.
      Swanson emphasizes the importance of transparency and courage in confronting such
      injustices, urging others to speak out against the bank's actions and the underlying
      systemic issues.

      June 19, 2025


      Does she think we are idiots? Does Denmark’s foreign policy establishment? I am
      a Danish citizen, and this fraudulent speech with a gross lie through omission
      is morally and politically unacceptable.


      H. E. Ambassador, Christina Markus Lassen, spoke at the UN Security Council’s
      urgent meeting caused by Israel’s attack on Iran. Read her short – shocking –
      speech here.


      She is an experienced Danish diplomat, partly educated in the US (of course),
      and has been her country’s ambassador to Syria, where she collaborated with the
      US (the famous Mr Ford!), France, and the UK to shape a “Western approach” – to
      changing the government of Bashar al-Assad, one must assume.


      Perversely as hard to believe, she does not mention that Israel has attacked Iran!


      No, she starts with the US/Israeli mantra – they are both major nuclear powers,
      of course – that Iran shall never be allowed to have nuclear weapons: “Iran must
      never be allowed to acquire a nuclear weapon. For years, Iran has continued to
      undertake activities in blatant violation of the JCPOA.”


      Here she conveniently tells a lie; first, there is no international law-based
      decision anywhere that Iran shall never be allowed to acquire these weapons. It’s
      a US and Israeli determination, nothing else. She must, therefore, omit that Israel
      has between 50 and 400 nukes, depending on sources and estimates, and that the
      UN, where she speaks, has decided decades ago that the Middle East shall be a
      zone free of weapons of mass destruction. More about the basic facts here.


      By omission, she lies again with the reference to the JCPOA. That extremely important
      agreement of 2015 – a brilliant piece of diplomacy – was abrogated unilaterally
      by Donald Trump in 2018. He called it “horrible” and we now see what a great alternative
      he has up his sleeve.


      Furhtermore, there exists no report that Iran broke any provisions, even though
      the JCPOA was not binding with a major participant having left it. On the contrary,
      three months ago, Trump’s national security director, Tulsi Gabbard, stated that
      there were no signs that Iran was aiming at getting nuclear weapons.


      This ambassador of omission and misinformation continues with another blatant
      lie about Iran – that “these activities constitute a threat to international peace
      and security and a threat to the global non-proliferation regime.” Had she had
      the decency to even mention Israel in her speech, she would have added that Israel
      felt threatened and that its attack was an act of self-defence, or ‘pre-emptive.’.
      Have no doubt!


      Anyhow, Iran – which has never attacked or occupied another state (no matter what
      you may think of its theocratic policies) and has no nuclear weapons (but could
      have acquired them 2-3 decades ago if it wanted constitutes a threat to international
      security and peace! In contrast, Israel, which is a nuclear state, has repeatedly
      attacked Iran and other countries and conducted the worst genocide since 1945
      does not constitute such a threat!


      The rest of her speech is blah-blah, devoid of intellectualism – the work of security
      and peace illiterates. Kakistocrats. I mean, when you can only urge “all parties”
      to show restraint and de-escalate but can’t mention the aggressor, your political
      capacity resembles a snowball in hell.


      These distortions and turning reality upside-down are, of course, made in order
      to please the two exceptionalist states with lots of historical blood on their
      hands that I call “USrael” – at the moment the two most dangerous states and leadership
      on earth.


      H. E. the Ambassador knows what role to play at the stage of Western reckless
      interventionism, militarism and criminal warfare. No respect for reality. No respect
      for fairness. And to hell with ethics.


      She says that “Denmark’s position is clear.” Which Denmark? Would all Danish citizens
      feel OK with this series of fake and omissions, with the Danish UN mission’s war-mongering
      statements in this crystal clear case of aggression in total violation of everything
      the UN and international stands for – letter as well as spirit? ‘


      No, so mean and so primitive are not all Danes. I for one say: Not in my name.
      I don’t want the terrible war Mme Christina Markus Lassen recklessly promotes
      in this particular speech.


      It is time that we citizens are given an opportunity to elect not only national
      “representatives” for a parliament but also those who “represent” – or are supposed
      to represent us – in international forums.


      Furthermore, perhaps it was a good idea that the media – if they have any independent
      thinking left – began to monitor what is stated in the name of Denmark and the
      Danish people’s name abroad. Particularly if Denmark’s diplomats at the finest
      organisation we have, the UN, do nothing but defile both the UN’s Charter and
      Denmark’s name in an attempt to promote a USraeli war that may threaten to set
      the whole Middle East on fire.'
    one_sentence_summary: In response to Denmark's Ambassador to the UN, Christina Markus
      Lassen, omitting Israel's attack on Iran and misrepresenting Iran's nuclear capabilities
      in her speech, Danish citizen Jan Oberg criticizes the foreign policy establishment

      Lassen's speech at a UN Security Council meeting regarding Israel's attack on

      unacceptable portrayal of the situation. Oberg argues that Lassen's omission of
      Israel's aggression and her framing of Iran as a nuclear threat, without acknowledging
      Israel's own nuclear capabilities, constitutes a significant distortion of reality.
      He contends that her remarks reflect a broader trend of Western interventionism
      and militarism, which he believes undermines Denmark's ethical standing and the
      principles of international law. Oberg calls for greater accountability and representation
      for Danish citizens in international forums, urging the media to scrutinize the
      actions and statements made by Danish diplomats that may compromise the country's
      integrity and contribute to escalating conflicts in the Middle East.

      (BRI), which was launched in 2013.


      1. East Asia


      With the current regionalization of the world where and even the biggest states
      will find their place, an East Asian Community of the two Chinas, the two Koreas
      and the three Japans (with the Ryu Kyu Islands–Okinawa–and an Ainu region both
      at high autonomy levels), is inevitable. The European Community-Union got started
      around steel and coal, ESC; how about starting with the tricky issues, like right
      now Diaoyu, of the islet clusters and their economic zones in the East Asian Sea?


      An East Asian Sea Authority could declare joint sovereignty, and go beyond joint
      ventures, exploiting and protecting resources together, the costs and benefits
      being distributed according to a formula reflecting past uses of the areas. In
      Europe the Danube Commission of 1856, with eleven state members and four observers,
      has served such purposes well, if not unproblematically. So did the ESCC.


      2. Shanghai Cooperation Organization


      With the expansion of NATO eastward, and the US-Japan Security Treaty de facto
      westward, with South Korea and Taiwan and deployment patterns for Japan’s SDF,
      SCO was bound to come. And bound to expand (currently six members, five observers
      with Mongolia and Sri Lanka) and a new opening as dialogue partners, gradually
      filling the gap of a missing Organization for Security and Cooperation in Asia-Pacific.
      SCO focuses on economic development, and military cooperation in anti-terrorism
      (China Daily News 11-09-10 reports a chiefs of general staffs of member countries
      meeting in Almaty); maybe somewhat single mindedly focused on economic development
      as the key to reducing terrorism. Political and cultural autonomy issues, being
      ruled by one’s own kind, if not necessarily as an independent country, may be
      as or more important. And “soft” economic and cultural power can be even harder
      than military power.


      3. Afghanistan


      The SCO sees the situation in Afghanistan as a threat to neighboring countries,
      including China, exporting of terrorism, drugs and criminality; the remedy being
      development. With that atrocious war slowly coming to an end, with US withdrawal
      on the horizon, SCO countries will play a major role in Afghanistan, facilitating
      more autonomy for all nations within the country, open borders to their co-nationals
      in neighboring countries, equal development for all nations and for both genders,
      and peacekeeping (not peace enforcing). For this SCO might cooperate with the
      ECO, Economic Cooperation Organization of Turkey, Iran and Pakistan, founded in
      1985 (as a successor to the Regional Cooperation for Development 1964-79) to help
      Afghanistan recover and develop in all regards. And, how about expanding the China-Kazakhstan
      railroad, linking Beijing and Ankara-Istanbul through a neutral Afghanistan, having
      Afghanistan join the world through its SCO-ECO neighbors?


      4. Updating the “Silk Road”


      Roughly speaking from 500 to 1500 the trade from China via West Asia to East Africa
      (Somalia) was the overwhelming part of the world trade volume, Europe being inward-looking,
      the Atlantic and the Pacific oceans not yet being used. Considerably more than
      silk was traded, and the “road” was mainly by the East Asian sea and the Indian
      Ocean. The traders were Buddhists in the East and Muslims in the West, till the
      whole pattern was destroyed by the Portuguese, the English and others, in the
      name of their kings and companies. Fortunately, that colonization is over.


      How about expanding that “road” for goods, services, people, through Africa, and
      the Atlantic, to Latin America by road-rail from Dar es-Sala’am to Kinshasa’s
      port, saving the voyage round South Africa, opening Africa East-West and the world
      South-South? Not substituting for the North-South trade established by colonialism,
      but complementing it? Weaving the world better together?


      5. Building on the Han Cun He Model


      The world goes through huge urbanization, and China, bridging dichotomies, is
      creating urban villages (that one has only 580 houses, for 3,000 inhabitants),
      combining collective agriculture and land ownership, with a cooperative construction
      company for building in Beijing and anywhere, with a former cement worker as highly
      entrepreneurial CEO. The village also offers houses for retired people and others.
      Such imaginative bridging is very much needed all over the world, like in a Cuba
      in search of some kind of “capi-communism”.


      6. “Human Rights and Harmonious World”


      In an excellent book with that title, China Society for Human Rights Studies,
      Beijing 2007, key concerns at individual and global levels are linked creatively.
      For a world dialogue all parties should embrace both the civil-political and the
      economic-social-cultural conventions of 16 December 1966, and look for ways of
      implementing the third generation of human rights to peace, development and clean
      environment. With a focus on the international, not only domestic, violations
      of human rights.


      7. China and Peace Studies


      Academic peace studies in China could build on China’s rich harmony-focused tradition,
      and the 1954-55 peace pillar of cooperation with all for mutual and equal benefit.
      Studies of reconciliation, mediation and peace construction would be enriched
      by opening for Chinese thought, and vice versa.


      8. The Chinese Self-presentation


      China should become better at explaining herself, both in a Western market-growth-democracy-human
      rights discourse, and in a Chinese discourse of both-and, yin-yang dialectics,
      distribution and social and world harmony. An oriental Davos in Hong Kong in dialogue
      with that Western one; and a global TV, more like multi-angle Al Jazeera than
      BBC-CNN, would give the world a strong, not abrasive, Chinese voice. With very
      much to say that the world in general, and the West in particular, badly need
      to hear.

      Community comprising the two Chinas, two Koreas, and three Japans, advocating
      for joint sovereignty over contested maritime territories to foster economic cooperation.
      Galtung also discussed the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) as a necessary
      response to NATO's eastward expansion, emphasizing its role in addressing regional
      security and economic development, particularly concerning Afghanistan. He suggested
      revitalizing historical trade routes, enhancing connectivity between Asia, Africa,
      and Latin America, and highlighted the importance of integrating human rights
      with global peace efforts. Galtung called for a better Chinese self-presentation
      in global discourse, promoting a dialogue that harmonizes Eastern and Western
      perspectives.

      June 18, 2025 at 01:20 AM


      We’ve seen it repeatedly: You invent a pretext based on deliberate lies, fake
      news, exaggerations or a false flag operation which serves to construct a story
      that country or leader X is a threat to “us” which legitimates that we do a ‘preemptive’
      strike against that – obviously invented – threat to eliminate it.


      Mainstream media’s task is to propagate the ploy, not to ask questions or reveal
      the lie.


      Take Serbia’s ‘genocide’ in Kosovo, Afghanistan’s responsibility for 9/11, Saddam’s
      possession of nukes in Iraq, Assad’s use of chemical weapons against the Syrians,
      Gaddafi’s ‘mass murder’ in Bengazi, Russia’s planning to occupy and administer
      not only Ukraine but also a series of European countries thereafter, Hamas’ attack
      on Israel – that Israel knew everything about before it happened – and now you
      have the blatant lie about Iran’s being just about to become a nuclear weapons
      power.


      Basic facts about Iran that we are not hearing


      Just a few facts you almost never hear but which are extremely important no matter
      what you think of the Iranian theocracy: It was the US/CIA and UK that made a
      regime-change in 1953 that deposed the democratically elected Dr. Mossadegh. The
      US installed the Shah – at the time the most ruthless and militarist leader in
      the world, and gave him nuclear technology.


      Since 1979, when the Iranian revolution sent him running and occupied the US Embassy
      in Tehran, the US has done nothing – nothing – but harass Iran and its 90 million
      innocent Iranian citizens with the hardest sanctions thinkable (that have destroyed
      the middle class that could, if any, have changed the country’s leadership). The
      US and other NATO countries have systematically been building up Israel militarily
      – knowing full well that Netanyahu’s 30-year-old pathological dream is to eliminate
      Iran.


      The leading actors in this drama are therefore “USrael” and not Iran.


      Furthermore, Iran does not have nuclear weapons; Israel has – estimates state
      up to 400. Iran is a member of the NPT, the Non-Proliferation Treaty; Israel is
      not. Iran has been under constant inspection by the IAEA, but Israel has never
      accepted that. Around 2003, the present Supreme Leader, Khamenei, issued a fatwa
      against nuclear weapons, which is considered by some to be consistent with Islamic
      tradition. Iran has not invaded or occupied any other country; Israel’s list is
      long.


      More recently, in 2015, the JCPOA Agreement was concluded, which was rightly considered
      a major diplomatic victory for all involved parties. It led Iran to significantly
      decrease its uranium enrichment. Iran kept itself within the limits of that agreement,
      but the boastful, grumpy Donald Trump cancelled the US’ participation in 2018,
      and Iran has since used its enrichment as a bargaining chip while never getting
      near the level that would permit it to produce a nuclear weapon. In March, Tulsi
      Gabbard, Trump’s director of national intelligence, confirmed that there was no
      indication that Iran was nearing the threshold. On June 17, Trump said that he
      did not care about what she said; he knew that Iran was ‘very close.’ More information
      on these matters can be found in my article from yesterday, available here.


      This will do as a broader background to the prediction in the headline. The West’s
      stockpile of lies, misinformation and media deception seems to me to be way more
      fateful than any Iranian military fact or activity.


      Specific reasons for the prediction and the laws of war


      Now to the more specific reasons, which point in one direction, only: A larger
      war on Iran with aim of changing the Iranian regime.


      According to media reports, Netanyahu had told Trump that Israel could kill the
      Supreme Leader, and Trump said he would not accept that. Israel has bombed civilian
      areas and the Iranian IRIB broadcasting complex in Iran, and Israeli agents have
      blown up cars inside Iran. None of that would be necessary to destroy nuclear
      research facilities. Trump left the G7 meeting early and stated that he was not
      working on a ceasefire between Iran and Israel but working on an “end, a real
      end,” and he has called for Iranian “UNCONDITIONAL SURRENDER” and demanded that
      Tehran’s population leave the city.


      He also talked about something bigger to come and that Iran better accept his
      demands before there would be nothing left of it. In the afternoon, US time today,
      he had a meeting in the White House Situation Room with his national security
      team. He talks about knowing exactly where the Supreme Leader is hiding, but that
      he has no plans to kill him – “at least not now.” (I leave aside at this point
      what to think about these international law-violating, fascist statements. Trump
      would have no qualms about killing Iranian top leaders, remember the 2020 liquidation
      of Qassem Soleimani).


      There are, while I write this, movements of huge US and British naval vessels
      to the region and talk about B52’s delivering bunker busters.


      There is no doubt that the Trump Regime gave the green light to the Netanyahu
      Regime’s unprovoked and fake-preemptive attack on Iran. Trump said that he knew
      “everything” about it well in advance. This, in my view, means that he has also
      faced the possibility that the US will be drawn in if the Iranian response over
      time would be too hard for Israel – already in war with several neighbouring states
      – to handle alone.


      This time, Iran has responded more forcefully than before, and it probably sees
      the USraeli threat as existential. If Iran continues to respond to Israeli attacks,
      this would drag in the US – and sooner rather than later. Trump would simply have
      no choice. He also knows that NATO allies in Europe will remain supportive of
      both him and Netanyahu if he goes down that slippery slope: A repetition of the
      Iraq war.


      Some may object here that Trump is just bluffing. First, bluffing whom? If Iran
      perceives this as a threat to its very existence, it is, of course, not going
      to unconditionally surrender. It will fight to the last Iranian, and the idea
      that the Iranians would stand along the roads when the US and Israeli forces roll
      into Tehran is as delusional as it was in the case of Iraq. (After one day in
      Baghdad in 2002, I understood that there would be no one, no matter what they
      thought of Saddam).


      No, there is another dynamic that is both much more powerful and relevant: the
      escalation of conflicts and violence, up to the outbreak of wars, pretty much
      follows its own dynamics and laws. If you’ve said “A” you have to move on and
      say “B” and do tit-for-tat – “C”… to the end of the alphabet, or the world.


      De-escalation is extremely difficult, but phoney/pious statemen love to advocate
      de-escalation because they have nothing else to suggest and because they themselves
      caused the escalation in the first place by pumping in weapons, supporting one
      side and demonise the other in a conflict and have no clue about conflict-resolution,
      mediation, peace-making, reconciliation and that sort of – to them totally irrelevant
      – professional knowledge. Simply put, they are conflict and peace illiterates.


      Given what has already happened, I do not have the imagination to see how Trump
      and Netanyahu can now back down from their words and deeds without losing face,
      and that is not exactly what they are known for. They will soon be guided less
      by their own decisions than by the laws of militarism, escalation and eventually
      full warfare: warfare for regime-change in Iran.


      De-nuclearise Israel and have both under NPT and IAEA


      To some extent, the nuclear issue is a pretext. To some extent, it is a real issue
      too. The tragedy is that it is impossible for anyone to destroy nuclear technology
      facilities and equipment, perhaps 100 meters down in massive mountains. Secondly,
      if they could succeed, Iran is capable of re-establishing its capacity and will
      likely have become convince by the USrael policies that it has, against its will,
      to acquire nuclear weapons.


      Since Israel has nuclear weapons and thereby violates all the non-binding UN resolutions
      about the Middle East as a zone free of weapons of mass destruction, the simple,
      effective solution would be for the international community to deprive Israel
      of its nuclear weapons and place both countries in the NPT and under IAEA surveillance.
      The West’s stupid insistence that Israel shall have nuclear weapons while Iran
      shall not is simply illogical, conflict- and war-promoting as well as morally
      unsustainable and discriminatory.


      The dissolution of the messianic West: Evil, exceptionalism, escalation and eschatology


      None of these decision-makers is burdened with ethics, long-term thinking or analyses
      of the consequences of their actions. They are driven by emotions, groupthink,
      lack of basic security knowledge, hubris, hate (of an Iran they do not know as
      anything but ‘mullahs’), of self-aggrandisement and a belief that they are exceptionalist.
      After all, the US and Israel are the two exceptionalist states par excellence.
      They see themselves as standing above the laws, ethics, and norms that the rest
      of the world feels obliged to respect at least to some extent.


      In their delusional omnipotence, they seem to accept a kind of modern-day eschatological
      paradigm supplemented with the catharsis that the use of nuclear weapons may seem
      to promise: The birth of a new world in which Evil – that of the ‘others’ has
      been eradicated. That that evil is merely a psycho-political projection of their
      own evil system, such as militarism, and personalities, is of course, an unthinkable
      thought. However, it is an end-time view that is deeply embedded in Western Christian
      and Jewish social cosmology, which probably steers more in situations such as
      this than any rational thought, analysis, or prudent statesmanship.


      Macro-historically, it belongs to a civilisation, an Empire, in rapid decline,
      decay and dissolution. And at the micro-level, it would be foolish to underestimate
      Trump’s and Netanyahu’s messianic zeal in times of their systems’ decay. I fear
      weapons, yes. But I fear these types of people more.'
    one_sentence_summary: The article argues that the U.S. and Israel are fabricating
      threats against Iran to justify military action, while highlighting the historical
      context of U.S.-Iran relations, the hypocrisy of nuclear policies, and the dangerous
      escalation of conflict driven by leaders like Trump and Netanyahu.
    paragraph_summary: In a critical analysis, Jan Oberg argues that the U.S. and Israel
      are fabricating threats to justify military actions against Iran, similar to past
      pretexts used for conflicts in Kosovo, Iraq, and Syria. He highlights that Iran,
      despite being portrayed as a nuclear threat, is a signatory of the Non-Proliferation
      Treaty (NPT) and has not invaded other countries, while Israel possesses nuclear
      weapons and operates outside of international oversight. Oberg emphasizes the
      historical context of U.S. interference in Iran, including the 1953 coup that
      installed the Shah, and critiques the ongoing sanctions that harm Iranian citizens.
      He warns that escalating tensions, fueled by aggressive rhetoric from leaders
      like Trump and Netanyahu, could lead to a larger war aimed at regime change in
      Iran, driven by a militaristic mindset rather than ethical considerations. Oberg
      concludes that the solution lies in disarming Israel and placing both nations
      under international nuclear oversight, arguing that the current approach is unsustainable
      and morally indefensible.

    text: 'War-preparation and militarism are now the main factors that keep the West
      together, and will make it fall faster.


      Jan Oberg


      June 3, 2025


      The Western world has lost its consciousness, perception, and instruments of conflict
      analysis, resolution, peace-making, and reconciliation.


      They’ve been squeezed out by militarism’s kakistocrats – a political science term
      that means government by “the worst, least qualified, or most unscrupulous people.”
      Consequently, there is now a risk of more than 50% that a major war will happen
      in Europe.


      I’ve been observing silently for weeks and months now how geopolitical experts
      – also very qualified ones – and people who comment independently as well as in
      the mainstream media and many others have worked on the tacit, implicit assumption
      that President Trump would help create peace in Ukraine; they seem to believe
      that what we have witnessed has anything to do with knowledge-based, professional
      peace-making or would have even the slightest chance of leading to peace.


      I appreciate, of course, that Trump took the phone to Putin to begin with, but
      I have not shared what looks like illusions of virtually everybody else. It seems
      to me that we see is 100% illiteracy about peace, conflict analysis, peacemaking,
      and mediation – not to mention the taboo word nonviolence.


      There has been no discussion about these ‘peace’-making activities per se. Or
      about the possible phases of professional peace-making. Everything done – like
      the one-hour “negotiations” in Istanbul on June 2, 2025, immediately after the
      Ukrainian military attack thousands of kilometres into Russia – is nothing but
      games played. By all sides. Probably, none of the parties has a clue about what
      to do to achieve peace – having put themselves on the autopilot of re-armament,
      militaristic attitudes, hatred and war-planning.


      The discourse is, again 100%, on war, ceasefire, deal-making, more arms to Ukraine
      and other things that are totally irrelevant/counterproductive for genuine peace
      work. If you genuinely wanted to stop a war, to do something constructive about
      the underlying conflict, and try to mediate or in other ways produce a sustainable
      peace between former adversaries and combatants, none of this would take place,
      and experts would have commented on it as a game – a futile media-seducing game
      and not as if it was professional policy activities.


      Just consider one example of this conflict illiteracy: that people seemingly do
      not think of the simple fact that a mediator must be completely neutral among
      all parties to a conflict and have no interest in any particular solution or future
      arrangement. The illiterates seem to believe that Donald Trump – the leader of
      the single most responsible country when it comes to the conflict and with a mountain
      of personal, corporate and political US interests – can step in and play the role
      of mediator seeking to find the best solution for all these complex conflicts’
      parties.


      Many instruments are available but not used


      The world has many means and instruments. Not perfect, not as efficient as the
      weapons and war organisations, but we do have the United Nations, the only organisation
      with decades of accumulated experience in peacemaking, peacekeeping, disarmament,
      ceasefire, and more. We have the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in
      Europe, OSCE.


      We have civil society organisations, CSOs, that are specialised in conflict analysis
      and reconciliation, peacemaking, etc. We have former diplomats who are well-experienced
      in these kinds of things.


      However, what we do not have are peace and conflict experts serving as advisors
      in the offices of presidents, prime ministers, ministers of foreign affairs, and
      ministers of defence. They obviously believe that they can manage only with military
      expertise wearing uniforms on the outside and civilian people wearing inner, politically-correct
      “intellectual” uniforms who are unable to raise fundamental questions, devise
      scenarios and strategies, and estimate long-term consequences of these war policies
      – the Western groupthink narrative.


      Like so many others, these leaders – on all sides – have no respect for peace
      as a distinct field of knowledge and expertise like, say, political science, international
      law, or medicine – and seem, therefore, to believe that they are themselves experts
      in everything related to peace.


      Or, consider the mentioned one-hour meeting in Istanbul; the tables are set wrongly
      if the purpose was to further a dialogue: two long tables with the adversaries
      confronting each other, ready to verbally attack, with somebody at the end in
      front of some flags. There is no strategy, no method, no idea about an agenda
      and how to set up phases to follow up. It lasted about one hour, and that is why
      we can state that without having been there.


      Only conflict illiterate people would set it up that way and without professional
      procedures and methods. Only peace-illiterate people believe that you can take
      participants straight from the battlefield or command centres, put them down at
      such a table arrangement to facilitate a ceasefire.

      “The Museum of The Ministry of Eternal Warfare.”


      No, a professionally devised strategy would start out with a truly respected mediator(s)
      and mechanisms and begin interviewing each party at a time (without others present)
      about things like this: How do you define the conflict – what is it about as you
      see it? What are you afraid of now and in the future? What do you want in the
      future, and what are your priorities? What is your ideal future, and what less-than-optimal
      futures could you imagine to live with? Do you see any point in time and space
      where there is a kind of affinity between you and the other parties? What things
      do you have in common with other parties to this conflict? When back in time did
      you experience a better relationship with the others? How do you want to proceed,
      what is your desired mediation plan? What kind of expertise do you think is needed
      – and how do you feel about ways to achieve reconciliation at the human/citizens’
      level – and that sort of things – here just mentioned as illustrations of some
      of the issues that will, over a long time, have to be addressed with one party
      at a time and then with pairs of parties.


      Tell you what? Only after a very elaborate process taking many months and when
      the mediators have a sense that there is some common ground – do the parties meet
      at a table. You do not start there – because failed meetings only confirm that
      peace will be impossible.


      Furthermore, these helter-skelter meetings for ‘ceasefire’ are predicated upon
      a cynical and ignorant idea in Europe that NATO country troops can suddenly play
      the role of peace-keepers. They can’t. They have no training for that. The idea
      is akin to suggesting surgery performed by a person who has never opened a medical
      textbook.


      More elements of peace and conflict illiteracy and quackery and why people believe
      in it.


      This is the intellectual level today. The reason is that war is in focus, not
      the underlying conflict which is the key to peace. The battlefield, the violence
      is never the key to peace – only the underlying conflicts that led to the violence.


      A conflict can be seen as a problem that stands between the parties and needs
      to be solved, and if the parties do not know how, they fall into the violence
      trap that makes everything worse.


      The European interest – even with the US’s relative withdrawal from that already
      lost war – is to keep the war going in some kind of way, seeking, as has been
      stated many times by NATO countries’ leaders, to destabilise and ultimately defeat
      Russia.


      It so happens that we have a world organisation, the UN – whose Article 1 states
      that peace shall be established by peaceful means. The UN is geared, trained and
      experienced in peacekeeping, civil affairs, civil policing, disarmaming combatants
      and putting weapons under lock in stores, and forcing combatants to then sit down
      and discuss the future in local communities and elsewhere. And – mind you – take
      care of the civilian, suffering people in the (former) war zones and helping them
      start a normal life again.


      Furthermore, the kind of quackery peace-making we witness completely lacks every
      sense of the importance of building peace from below.


      It seems to be a common (mis)understanding that presidents and other top elites
      who’ve been fighting and killing each other’s people suddenly can be peacemakers.
      We’re forgetting completely that millions and millions of people, ordinary citizens
      of all walks of life, shall be living with whatever ‘peace’ plan these presidents,
      out of only their own interests, on all sides, may cook up in total ignorance
      of their people’s ideas, needs and visions.


      That’s how it is often done. Remember the Dayton Accords in 1995? Or the talks
      at Rambouillet that served as a pretext for NATO’s (unlawful) bombings of Serbia?
      Even if they did put a lid on the fighting and killing, they caused more problems
      and solved none. Quackery peace-making create failed states that are unravelling
      as of today, 30 years later, building up to new outbreaks of violence.


      The word ‘peace’ and the thinking and knowledge associated with it have been largely
      eradicated from government circles, the media, research, and, I fear, to a large
      extent, among ordinary citizens of Europe. Peace is not on any elite agenda. A
      whole science and an art are systematically ignored. Would any of these leaders
      play doctors on themselves if they fell ill? No, they would consult the best doctors
      they could find – but they’d never turn to a conflict doctor or qualified mediator.
      They probably never even thought of doing so.


      The Western NATO/EU world has become mediation illiterate. Peace illiterate. Conflict
      illiterate and reconciliation and forgiveness illiterate. These knowledge fields
      are huge, complex and woefully under-researched because militarists don’t want
      them. Peace shall emerge, they think, from a focus on the violence, the war, the
      battlefields and the (non-monitored?) ceasefire. They do not even know that the
      key to peacemaking lies in understanding the underlying conflicts that led to
      the violence in the first place.


      It’s like a doctor who gives you a painkiller when you say you have a headache
      and ignores a deeper diagnosis and prognosis, and therefore does not find the
      deeper reason: that you have a brain tumour and will die soon if nothing serious
      is done.


      Without any knowledge, interest in, curiosity about, openness to conflict analysis
      and peacemaking, there is no alternative to war.


      Of course, they all know what sounds good in the media, misinformation and propaganda
      departments. For instance, that they themselves are innocent victims while their
      adversaries are 100% responsible for the situation. They will all say that they
      want the war to stop – like Trump, who says that far too many have died in Ukraine
      but fully supports Israel’s genocide, bombs the Houthis, makes mindboggling multi-billion
      arms deals with Saudi Arabia and embraces a major terrorist like Syria’s new president.
      They will all say that they want a ceasefire and then a stable peace characterised
      by justice. How boring! It is so dull that it is quoted again and again by the
      world’s media, which, gallantly, do not point out just how phoney these peace
      wishes really are.


      Don’t trust any of them on any side. If they wanted peace in Europe, there would
      never have been a NATO expansion into Ukraine or a Russian Special Military Operation
      into it. There would never have been a Ukrainian leader who played the role of
      puppet for Western militarism and de-stabilisation of Russia no matter the price
      to be paid for his own country and people generations into the future.


      If they wanted peace and knew what peace is or could be and how to make it, the
      war would have stopped long ago and be seen as a tragic mistake/misunderstanding.


      If they were interested in sustainable peace and common security, they would have
      listened to each other and engaged in dialogue, rather than ignoring one another,
      provoking and cancelling each other. They would never have built long-range, incredibly
      destructive deterrence weapons, nor would there have been any nuclear weapons
      on earth or 650 US bases in 130 countries. There would have been ministries of
      peace, civilian conflict-solving institutions, peace education in schools and
      peace advisers in all decision-making offices.


      We’ve become a sick, militarist society, and people do not even see it.


      And not to be misunderstood: I do not refer here only or mainly to the Russian
      invasion of Ukraine. Weapons and violence were part of everything US/NATO did
      from the coup d’etat and regime change under the Obama administration in Kiev
      in 2014, 11 years ago, over Trump 1.0, Biden and the present Trump Regime.


      It was CIA all over Ukraine from that year, biological weapons laboratories, building
      a Ukrainian army that began killing Russians in Donbas, in order to prepare for
      Ukraine’s future NATO membership even though there was never more than 15% of
      its all the Ukrainians who wanted NATO membership before the invasion; they wanted
      a security agreement with Russia. Many talk about Ukraine in NATO, but the relevant
      perspective is NATO in Ukraine from about a few months after it became independent
      – 30+ years ago. NATO suffers from extreme hubris and exploited – unwisely to
      be diplomatic – Russia’s weakness and cheated on it well-documented promise to
      never expand NATO if the two Germanies were united in NATO.


      Unfortunately, one may argue today that Russia fell into NATO’s trap and the invasion
      – small crime compared with Kosovo, Iraq, Syria, Libya and lots of other US/NATO-created
      warzones and – could then be given full propaganda blast: “Look Putin has taken
      the first step to conquer all of Europe.” Citizens who are told to fear that they’ll
      be attacked – they are victims of their elites’ fearology – mostly believe it,
      but it is a scenario that has no realism on this earth.


      So peace is out. Or war is peace. And when there’s nobody talking peace, there
      is only war left. Peace is a matter of culture. This is a matter of education.
      It is a matter of civilisation. While any drunk idiot can start a fight in a pub
      – or a war – it is not within everybody’s capacity to make peace. Which is why
      we have prizes for peace but not for invasions, wars, genocides, mass murders
      or nuclear warfighting…


      Conflict happen! There will always be conflicts – big and small anywhere – because
      we are different and want different things, have different visions about the good
      society. But there doesn’t have to be violence. There are conflict without violence,
      but there is no violence without a conflict. Solving conflicts elegantly and intelligently
      is to employ as little violence as possible the problem – which corresponds to
      the vow of medicine: Do as little harm in the healing process as possible – but
      do heal!


      This what the UN Charter is all about. NATO’s Treaty is a copy of it. It’s just
      that NATO violates its own treaty 24/7 since it bombed Yugoslavia/Serbia in 1999.


      Imperialists, warmongers, narrow-minded power-holders and cynical militarists
      who could not care less about human suffering of course do not see it that way.
      They choose violence either because they have an inner urge – such as hubris,
      hatred and revenge or are unhappy humans, perhaps even evil – and/or because they
      do not have a clue about conflict resolution methods and peace-making.


      They choose war because there is – everywhere – a MIMAC, a Military-Industrial-Media-Academic
      Complex of elites who make decisions to benefit themselves, not their citizens,
      and who would likely eliminate any important leader who would pursue true peace…


      The post-conflict-resolution phase – sustainable peace.


      A conflict is only solved when it never comes back in the same form and shape
      as before – but it does not mean that new conflicts cannot turn up. If we imagine
      now that some kind of comprehensive, real solution has been found and violence
      is no longer taking place among the parties – and no party plans to take up weapons
      again or seek revenge, then comes all the things nobody talks about today – things
      like truth commission, reconciliation, forgiveness, cooperation to reduce the
      risks of new conflicts, other violence prevention measures in the future – and
      lots of other difficult things.


      After more than 10 years of this conflict and more than three years of heart-breaking
      mass killings and destruction, I have not come across one single discussion about
      issues such as these – neither seen one visionary plan for a new Europe where
      all that we have seen now cannot possibly happen again. None!


      Even peace people tend to be focused on the weapons dimension instead of devising
      peace plans and new peace and conflict-resolution structures that promise to prevent
      a repetition. And scholars would likely lose their government project funds if
      they seriously engaged with such issues…


      Conflict and peace illiteracy prevail because of the misguided notion that peace
      can be achieved through the accumulation and use of weapons. Excuse me, but if
      weapons could bring us peace, how come that NATO, which stands for almost 60%
      of the world’s military expenditures, is now the major party to a conflict that
      threatens Europe and perhaps the whole world – with increasing probability – to
      blow up in conventional and (perhaps) nuclear exchanges?


      Excuse me once again, but the US/NATO Emperor’s clothes are not new, they are
      old and dirty.


      So, in summary, all these militarists and war-mongers on all sides paradoxically
      have one thing in common: Violence and war is all we need! We do not need conflict
      analysis, mediation, or peace-making. We do not need the UN or anybody else. Peace
      is a residual when the weapons have spoken and sufficiently many have perished.


      There appears to be a lack of awareness among decision-makers, security experts,
      and the media that we need innovative proposals on how to secure Ukraine’s future,
      address Russia’s legitimate security concerns, and coexist in peace in Western
      Europe – and with China. Conflict resolution and peacemaking are about seeing
      a better future beyond militarism and destruction. It can never grow out of an
      obsession with the present and the past.


      Militarists and other people in power hate if people out there who a) have smarter
      ideas than they have – and that is not so difficult – and b) oppose their militarism,
      groupthink and propagandised narrative. War times are not times of lively dialogues
      and many competing scenarios. It’s times of intellectual emptiness, authoritarianism
      and moral decay.


      The more war and militarism, the less tolerance and creativity, and the less democracy
      and freedom…thinking. Militarism and war-mongering has its own laws and dynamics
      and takes Herculian efforts for a leader to stop and think and – do something
      else. For the train goes to destruction.


      That is what we see in today’s West, which is engaging in constant confrontation
      because it knows deep down that it is in decline and, as it seems, cannot reinvent
      itself in even the smallest ways and become an attractive partner in the future
      multi-polar cooperative and more peaceful world.


      For years now, geopolitical experts, media, scholars and most citizens have focused
      on the war. They focus on the present and the past, and who did what to whom.
      They do not engage in ideas about the future, the better future for all. It seems
      that they would rather start all over on the ruins and debris after a conventional
      and/or nuclear war just to prove how right they were and how wrong everybody else
      was.


      None of the parties has presented a vision of what the future European security
      system should be that could satisfy the minimum requirements and legitimate needs
      and interests of all the involved parties. And where there is no better vision,
      continued war fighting looks relatively more attractive and so natural.


      So that’s where we are. No politician, editor or researcher of some power see
      it fit – or is capable of – saying: Hey, if all this has not worked and we are
      now in such a dangerous situation in the name of ‘security’ politics, perhaps
      we should ask ourselves: What has been wrong about the ways we have thought out
      security since 1945? How come that the sum total of the arms-based national security
      paradigm has caused us all endless waste of resources, millions of dead fellow
      human beings, devastated whole countries and now threatens to annihilate humanity?
      How should we do it in the future to achieve a real peace instead of the militarised
      peace of the graveyards and – together – invest everything in solving humanity’s
      real and serious problems instead of wasting and losing everything – instead of
      militarising ourselves to death?


      H. C. Andersen invented the little boy who saw the deception, the misinformation
      – and spoke up. He is nowhere to be seen in today’s Western world.


      It is the limitless armament and offensive deterrence – the classical security
      dilemma – a totally wrong-headed thinking that can never bring the world peace
      – that has led us to where we are now. Increased military spending, now even tied
      by NATO’s anti-intellectual church congregation to the GNP – that has led us to
      where we are now.


      NATO’s and Russia’s offensive deterrence theory, albeit different, has led us
      to where we are now. After all, they are both Western societies thinking alike
      on fundamental dimensions. Two scorpions inside the same Western bottle.


      It’s a dead dangerous perpetuum mobile that is kept going by a drug addiction-like
      propensity to always need more weapons – and do with less and less thinking. Constant
      upward militarism and war-planning have always been accompanied by intellectual
      and moral disarmament. So, the only answer that this religious community will
      come up at NATO’s next summit is to increase the self-destructive medicine called
      armament to even 5% of the gross national product and for the EU to waste a further
      € 100 billion on more drugs of militarism. But they will tell you – and perhaps
      believe themselves – that its for ‘defence’ in a ‘defensive’ alliance that will
      bring peace if only it gets a little more money…


      Three results will follow: a) an increased risk of war; b) a destruction of the
      civil economy and c) the West will become weaker and weaker on all indicators
      vis-a-vis the rest of the world.


      I don’t know how you feel, but I feel that a society that has cancelled peace,
      every bit of it, not even preserving 1% but has given 100% to militarism, is a
      society that will break down – militarise itself to death like the incurable drug
      misuser and can not, will not and deserves not to survive.


      Militarism and warfare are now the primary forces that hold the West together.
      It will destroy no one but the West itself – neither Russia nor China nor anybody
      else, all of whom have never been out to destroy the West. The Western elites
      of the MIMAC – the Military-Industrial-Media-Academic Complex – do that brilliantly
      themselves. The enemy is us.


      Therefore, it’s as safe as tragic to predict that the Western decline will accelerate.
      And the Rest of the world – 88% of humanity – will deplore but mostly applaud
      it. The last empire in human history – no, it is not in the Chinese genes to build
      an empire – is crumbling, but will its collapse in a nuclear catastrophe?


      The Soviet Union’s nuclear empire dissolved peacefully, largely due to its visionary
      leader, Mikhail Gorbachev. Frightening as it is, no Western leader today reaches
      his socks.

    paragraph_summary: In his article, Jan Oberg argues that the Western world is increasingly
      dominated by militarism and war-preparation, which he believes will lead to its
      rapid decline. He criticizes the lack of genuine conflict analysis, resolution,
      and peace-making efforts among political leaders and experts, who are instead
      focused on militaristic strategies and rhetoric. Oberg highlights the dangers
      of relying on figures like Donald Trump as mediators in conflicts, emphasizing
      the need for neutral, knowledgeable mediators and the use of established organizations
      like the UN for peace efforts. He laments the absence of discussions on sustainable
      peace and reconciliation, asserting that the current approach to conflict resolution
      is fundamentally flawed and ignores the underlying issues that lead to violence.
      Ultimately, he calls for a shift in focus from militarism to genuine peace-building
      strategies that engage all parties and prioritize long-term solutions over immediate
      military responses.

      This analysis was initially published on the author’s “China21 Journal” which
      contains several analyses of related issues, China-Western relations and how to
      increase knowledge and mutual understanding.


      Last week, we picked up our 5-year-old son from his public kindergarten in Beijing.
      On the way home, he proudly recited a Tang Dynasty poem by heart — 春望 (Chūnwàng,
      or Spring View, 757 AD), one of the most famous and widely recited works from
      that vibrant dynastic era over a thousand years ago, written by the renowned poet
      杜甫 (Dù Fǔ, 712–770). The poem reflects on wartime and exile — hardly light or
      child-friendly themes. But that’s not the point. Children (and adults) recite
      ancient poems not just for their content, but for their rhythm, rhyme, tone, and
      the cultural feeling embedded in them.


      This is how cultural programming begins: not through rules or explanations, but
      through patterns of sound, expression, emotion, action, and symbolism absorbed
      long before we are aware of them.


      Source Wikipedia including details about the structure, genre and context of the
      poem. Translation by Stephen Owen, American sinologist specializing in Chinese
      literature, particularly Tang dynasty poetry and comparative poetics. He taught
      Chinese literature and comparative literature at Harvard University.


      Between Understanding and Being Shaped


      From the moment a child is born, they are immersed in a world shaped by specific
      values, social codes, daily rhythms, and unspoken assumptions. This early immersion
      is what we call cultural programming — a term introduced by Dutch sociologist
      Geert Hofstede. He described culture as the “software of the mind”: deep, invisible
      coding that influences how we think, act, and interpret meaning (Hofstede, 2001).
      Even if you live in another country, speak its language fluently, and study its
      customs, there remains a core difference between understanding a culture and being
      shaped by it. Cultural programming can be built upon, but never fully replaced.


      That shaping begins at birth — or even earlier. Behavioral geneticist Robert Plomin
      notes that temperament and cognitive sensitivity, which influence how children
      learn and respond to their environment, are at least partly heritable (Plomin,
      2018). This means cultural programming isn’t just learned; it may also be reinforced
      by inherited dispositions that align a child with the values and expectations
      of their cultural setting.


      This becomes especially clear when we look at cultural transitions between profoundly
      different civilizations — such as East Asian societies like China and the Germanic
      or Anglo-Saxon cultures of Europe and North America. Despite increasing globalization,
      the cultural DNA of these societies remains deeply distinct. A foreigner living
      in China may become fluent in Mandarin, study Chinese history, grasp the influence
      of Confucian or Daoist thought, and immerse themselves in society. Yet the emotional
      instincts and reflexes shaped in early life — how one responds to authority, ambiguity,
      success, setbacks, shame, or praise; how one argues, apologizes, or interprets
      silence — often remain rooted in the cultural code of one’s upbringing. One can
      perform another culture, but it’s much harder to feel it in the same instinctive
      way as someone born into it.


      Culture as Cognition and Evolution


      In East Asia, including China, and in the West, people often think differently—not
      just act differently. Western cognition tends to be analytical and focused on
      discrete categories, while East Asian thinking is more relational, holistic, and
      context-aware (Nisbet, 2003). These are not just surface-level preferences; they
      shape everything from how problems are framed to how social harmony or disagreement
      is approached.


      Whereas Chinese thinking often follows a cyclical, process-oriented path, Western
      thinking is more linear and goal-driven.


      Cultural programming, then, is not only about beliefs or behaviors, but about
      mental framing—what we pay attention to, what we filter out, how we interpret
      uncertainty and change, and even what we consider a “problem” in the first place.


      Mental framing is deeply rooted in foundational cultural tools—such as the structure
      and learning methods of language, mathematics, and number systems. While it is
      widely recognized that the Chinese language differs significantly in structure
      and expression, numerical systems in China also reflect a distinct mental orientation.
      Chinese thinking operates in units of 万 (wàn, ten thousand) and 亿 (yì, one hundred
      million), rather than thousands and millions as in many Western contexts. Similarly,
      ancient Chinese mathematics prioritized algorithmic approaches geared toward practical
      computation, whereas Greek mathematics emphasized formal proof and abstract reasoning.


      Beyond language and number systems, cultural programming is also deeply shaped
      by how societies perceive the purpose of education, conceptualize time, and construct
      calendrical systems and cycles. Similarly, legal and ethical frameworks—shaped
      and reshaped over centuries—inform collective notions of justice, fairness, and
      appropriate behavior. In doing so, they embed culturally specific patterns of
      reasoning and judgment into the routines of daily life. All these elements reflect
      distinct civilizational rhythms and priorities.


      This view is echoed in the work of Joseph Henrich, who argues that human evolution
      is as much cultural as it is biological. The practices and norms passed down through
      generations—from child-rearing to conflict resolution—are not merely social habits.
      They are evolved systems of knowledge, survival, and intelligence embedded in
      cultural life (Henrich, 2016). Disrupting or discarding them without understanding
      their purpose can lead to unintended consequences.


      This becomes especially relevant when observing the rise of so-called “woke” discourse
      in various Western societies. Anglo-Saxon cultures—and to some extent, Germanic
      ones—have long emphasized the individual. Enlightenment ideals, Protestant ethics,
      and liberal political thought have reinforced values such as autonomy, self-expression,
      and individual rights. I recall being encouraged as a child to “find myself,”
      to pursue my own path and ambitions—ideals that are not seen as disruptive, but
      rather as meaningful pursuits within a stable cultural framework. That framework
      is shaped by deeper codes of tradition, identity, and the contextual influence
      of family, society, or religion.


      In recent decades, however, this framework of cultural programming in Western
      societies has experienced significant fragmentation and disruption. Movements
      sometimes labeled as “woke” have emphasized individual experience and inclusivity,
      increasingly at the expense of more traditional and long-standing social structures.
      While this shift may stem from a genuine concern for justice and freedom, it can
      also lead to a weakening of inherited cultural codes. Children growing up in such
      environments may receive mixed signals: encouraged to honor diversity, yet also
      to define their identity independently; urged to question norms, yet expected
      to conform to new and often fluid social expectations.


      This contrasts sharply with the cultural programming in China (and other East
      Asian cultures), which is based on civilizational continuity. Rooted in thousands
      of years of Confucian, Daoist, and Legalist thought, Chinese society has developed
      a dense web of expectations around social roles, collective identity, and hierarchical
      order. Cultural values such as filial piety, harmony, and face (miànzi) are not
      recent inventions—they are inherited through generations and embedded in language,
      rituals, family norms, and educational systems. A child in China is not simply
      taught how to behave; they are immersed in a worldview where the self is always
      seen in relation to others.


      But cultural programming is not static. It evolves—gradually and unevenly. In
      China, while traditional values remain deeply influential, contemporary forces
      such as consumerism, digital culture, and globalization are reshaping how younger
      generations express themselves. Yet this change tends to be layered over the deeper
      cultural structure rather than replacing it. A Chinese teenager on social media
      may appear “Westernized,” but their emotional responses—to joy, shame, duty, or
      authority—often remain distinct from those of their Western peers.


      And that’s perfectly fine !


      Deep Codes and Diverging Paths


      In today’s deeply interconnected world, it is increasingly important to understand
      others’ cultural programming—not just what people in other cultures say or do,
      but why they act that way. This means grasping the underlying purpose and thought
      processes embedded in cultural codes rather than projecting our own cultural programming
      onto their behaviors.


      Fons Trompenaars’ model of cultural dimensions provides a useful framework for
      this deeper understanding, moving beyond cultural markers like negotiation tactics
      or etiquette. Dimensions such as Individualism versus Collectivism, Universalism
      versus Particularism, and others offer insight to subconscious logic behind behavior.
      While these cultural dimensions evolve over time and shift along a continuum,
      they rarely flip entirely. They shape behavior patterns deeply in different cultures,
      especially those formed in early childhood.


      Trompenaars’ 7 cultural dimensions


      Returning to the fragmentation and disruption of cultural programming in some
      Western societies (“woke” discourse as some call it)—particularly through the
      lens of Trompenaars’ framework—one can observe a drift toward more extreme ends
      of cultural dimensions, notably individualism and universalism. This kind of cultural
      extremism tends to erode the capability to empathize with, or even recognize,
      the opposite ends of these cultural dimensions—both within one’s own society and
      across cultural boundaries.


      Every culture encodes a blend of opposing cultural values—such as Universalism
      versus Particularism, or Individualism versus Collectivism—though with differing
      emphases. Cultural extremism arises when one pole becomes so dominant that the
      other is marginalized or dismissed, disrupting the balance of cultural codes in
      one’s own society and straining relationships with cultures that emphasize different
      values. Another example can be found in China during the 1970s, when the Cultural
      Revolution pushed the society toward a radical form of collectivism. As history
      shows, pulling cultural plugs too radically or dismantling long-standing codes
      often foreshadows turbulence.


      Trompenaars’ framework also offers valuable insight into the current global transformation
      and the dynamic shifts toward a multipolar world order—particularly in understanding
      China’s role. It helps illuminate key questions often asked in international discourse:
      How did China achieve such rapid modernization and innovation to become a moderately
      prosperous society? Is China actively seeking to dominate or reshape the world
      order? And amid ongoing geo-economic tensions and tariff wars, who is truly isolating
      whom?


      For a more in-depth exploration, the book Has China Devised a Superior Path to
      Wealth Creation? The Role of Secular Values (2021, Hampden-Turner, Peverelli &
      Trompenaars) offers a comprehensive analysis of these and other questions through
      the lens of Trompenaars’ cultural dimensions model.


      Living Between Cultural Rhythms


      Why am I so invested in Chinese culture? Beyond having a family here, I simply
      feel at home in China and within Chinese society. That sense of comfort and belonging
      fuels an ongoing curiosity. Understanding and immersing in cultural programming
      is central to this rewarding mental journey of discovery—and a journey of self-awareness,
      recognizing when my own cultural codes influence my thoughts and reactions. Usually
      these codes align well, but occasionally they cause confrontation when I’m reminded,
      sometimes uncomfortably, of the limits and biases within my own cultural programming.
      And at other instances, it works the other way around—where aspects of my cultural
      imprint challenge codes and values I now live within.


      This isn’t about right or wrong. Cultural programming — with all its invisible
      codes — has simply evolved differently across civilizations, shaped by historical
      eras and experiences. And it continues to evolve, requiring constant and subtle
      care to preserve the balance and integrity of unique cultural codes, while guarding
      against sprouts of cultural extremism.


      At its core, cross-cultural understanding doesn’t demand that we become the other.
      It begins with humility — acknowledging that others are shaped by different cultural
      codes, from birth or even before. Respect isn’t assimilation.


      It means recognizing the programming within ourselves and others — and appreciating
      that something as simple as a thousand-year-old poem, memorized in early childhood,
      can carry the weight of an entire civilization.


      It means reflecting critically on our own cultural programming and becoming conscious
      of the different codes that shape other cultures. After all, the software of the
      mind in each culture has not been written by formal rules, but by evolving patterns
      of sensory and emotional experience — practices that transmit and evolve knowledge,
      instinct, and intelligence over time.


      It means understanding that we have more in common than we might think — and that
      the diversity of cultural programming enriches human evolution. Instead of fragmentation
      or polarization, it offers the possibility of balancing the scales of cultural
      spectrums, expanding our collective capacity to learn, adapt, and thrive.


      As a grateful immigrant, I feel humbled watching our son be shaped by the rhythms
      and rhymes of Chinese culture, complemented by the positive influence of my own
      cultural imprint. While I’ll never live Chinese culture with the instinct of someone
      born and raised into it—and nor is that the goal, being a native of the specific
      and beautiful culture of Limburg in the south of the Netherlands—I did catch a
      small slip in his recital: he confidently credited the poem to the wrong Tang
      Dynasty poet. Clearly, ancient poetry features regularly in their kindergarten
      routine—enough for even the mix-ups to be performed with flair.


      Maybe one day I’ll draft a detailed outline of arguments to explain why I feel
      at home in China. But as I write this sentence, I realize that very impulse—to
      explain, to conclude—reflects codes of my own cultural programming. Why the urge
      to define an endpoint, when what truly matters is the unfolding of the journey
      itself?


      What nurtures deeper learning and gratitude: the destination, or the way itself?

    paragraph_summary: In his article, Gordon Dumoulin explores the concept of cultural
      programming, which refers to the deep, often invisible codes of culture that shape
      our worldviews from birth, influencing how we think, act, and interpret meaning.
      Using the example of his son reciting a Tang Dynasty poem, Dumoulin illustrates
      how cultural values and emotional responses are absorbed long before conscious
      understanding. He contrasts the distinct cognitive styles of East Asian and Western
      cultures, highlighting how cultural programming affects everything from problem-solving
      approaches to social interactions. Dumoulin emphasizes the importance of recognizing
      and respecting these cultural differences, especially in an increasingly interconnected
      world, and warns against the dangers of cultural extremism that can arise from
      disrupting inherited cultural codes. Ultimately, he advocates for a journey of
      self-awareness and humility in understanding both one's own cultural programming
      and that of others, fostering a richer appreciation of human diversity and evolution.
