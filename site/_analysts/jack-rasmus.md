summary: |
  The United States is entering a period of heightened geopolitical and fiscal instability, marked by new unilateral military actions and deepening domestic financial challenges. Recent developments underscore a pattern of aggressive foreign policy moves by the Trump administration, coupled with a long-term fiscal trajectory that many analysts warn is unsustainable.
  
  The most significant recent event is President Trump’s surprise launch of airstrikes against Iran on June 21, 2025. Despite campaign promises to end U.S. military entanglements, Trump authorized the attacks without congressional approval or international backing. According to **Jack Rasmus**, this decision was made in secret while public negotiations with Iran were ongoing, drawing parallels to historical surprise attacks such as Pearl Harbor. Rasmus highlights that the operation was orchestrated without consulting U.S. allies or the United Nations, and was heavily influenced by neoconservative advisors and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu. The move has raised serious concerns about the concentration of war powers in the executive branch and the lack of transparency or oversight.
  
  On the domestic front, the U.S. fiscal situation continues to deteriorate. **Jack Rasmus** points to a “looming fiscal crisis” driven by decades of tax cuts, surging defense spending, and rising interest payments on the national debt, which is projected to reach $38 trillion by the end of 2025. Interest payments alone have surpassed $1 trillion annually and could climb to $1.7 trillion by 2034. Rasmus argues that 60% of the budget deficit is attributable to insufficient tax revenues, primarily due to ongoing tax reductions for corporations and the wealthy, and that the elite’s focus on tax cuts, rather than fiscal responsibility, is exacerbating the crisis.
  
  In Ukraine, the Trump administration’s approach has shifted from demanding repayment for military aid to a more compromised minerals deal. The finalized “Minerals Deal 2.0” no longer requires Ukraine to use mineral revenues to repay the U.S., and instead ensures all revenues are reinvested in Ukraine for the next decade. However, the lack of a formal U.S. security guarantee for Ukraine and the existence of undisclosed documents have left questions about the true extent of U.S. commitments. This retreat from earlier hardline positions is seen by many as a capitulation, reflecting broader inconsistencies in U.S. foreign policy.
  
  Looking ahead, the trends suggest an accelerating decline in U.S. global influence, with unilateral military actions and fiscal mismanagement undermining both international alliances and domestic stability. As **Jack Rasmus** concludes, while the U.S. is not on the verge of collapse, there is a “high chance” that its imperial power will continue to erode across political, economic, and strategic dimensions in the coming years. The majority of analysts agree that unless there is a significant policy shift, these patterns are “quite likely” to persist, with the risk of further international isolation and internal fiscal crises.

  - title: America’s 25 Year Tax Cutting & Fiscal Train Wreck
    url: https://jackrasmus.com/2025/07/11/americas-25-year-tax-cutting-fiscal-train-wreck/
    text: 'by Jack Rasmus Last week the US Congress passed the Trump Tax Cuts. The mainstream
      media and economists have been mostly reporting the details of the cuts — i.e.
      which taxes got cut in the 2025 Act, how much accrued to businesses and wealthy
      as opposed to the rest of us, what’s the impact on GDP and maybe even government
      deficits and debt. All interesting facts. But not the most important. They purposely
      ignore the cuts in historical perspective and the bigger picture they represent.
      That bigger picture is the looming fiscal crisis driven by the growing convergence
      of runaway tax cutting since 2001, chronic escalating defense and war spending,
      more frequent deeper crashes of the economy with slower economic growth between,
      and now since 2022 accelerating trillion dollar annual interest costs on the US
      national debt. The US national debt is on track to reach $38 trillion by year
      end 2025. Interest payments to bondholders are already exceeding $1 trillion a
      year. The Congressional Budget Office, research arm of the US Congress, estimates
      the national debt will reach $56 trillion by 2034 with interest payments of $1.7
      trillion — and all that before Trump just passed $5 trillion tax cuts. Moreover,
      the US elite today show no sign of addressing the coming fiscal crash. It continues
      to: cut taxes by trillions on corporations, investors and wealthiest 1% households
      raise spending on the Pentagon, wars and other ‘defense’ allow health insurance
      and big Pharma to gouge the US Treasury pay holders of US securities—foreign and
      US—trillions of dollars more every year Multiple studies show that historically
      60% of the US budget deficits and thus national debt are due to insufficient tax
      revenues — from chronic tax cutting, slow economic growth, legal avoidance and
      fraud. Here’s some interesting facts about cumulative tax cuts by both political
      parties together since 2001. Cumulative Tax Cutting 2001-2025 George W. Bush’s
      tax cuts in 2001-03 amounted to $3.8 trillion over the decade 2001-10. Estimates
      are roughly 80% accrued to corporations, businesses, and wealthy individuals by
      focusing overwhelmingly on individual income tax rates, corporate capital gains
      and dividends, and the estate tax affecting the wealthiest 1% or less households.
      Bush then cut taxes in the spring of 2008 by another $180 billion as the economy
      began to slide into recession and the great crash of 2008-09. When Obama took
      over in 2009 his American Rescue Plan stimulus for the economy passed that March
      provided for another $325 billion in tax cuts. His entire stimulus plan was $787
      billion, another $280 billion of the remaining $487 billion went to the states
      which then hoarded most of it. So less than $200 billion went to stimulate consumption
      which immediately proved too little to reboot the US economy. He had to add another
      $25 billion for ‘cash for auto clunkers’ and another $25B for ‘first time home
      buyers’ later that year. Most of the latter, moreover, didn’t go to home buyers
      but to mortgage lenders as incentive to approve more mortgages. When Bush’s tax
      cuts came up for renewal in 2010, Obama extended them for another two years through
      2012. That amounted to another $803 billion in tax cuts, again mostly to wealthy
      and corporations. In August 2011, in an agreement with the Republican Congress,
      Obama cut social program spending by $1.5 trillion in a new ‘austerity’ plan.
      $1 trillion was cut in just education and other social programs; $.5 trillion
      was supposed to be cut for defense spending but was kicked down the road and never
      applied. Austerity social program cuts always follow crisis bailouts. They did
      in 2011 after the 2009-10 bailouts. They’re occurring again today in 2025 after
      the 2020-21 Covid bailouts — more on which shortly. The 2012 Obama tax cuts made
      the Bush tax cuts permanent . They cost another $5 trillion. They were supposed
      to avoid what the media, lobbyists, and propagandists called the pending ‘fiscal
      cliff’. They were supposed to boost the economy. They didn’t. US economic growth
      in GDP terms for the rest of the Obama term averaged only 60% of what was historically
      average during recovery periods from the earlier 10 US recessions since 1948.
      Obama thus cut taxes on wealthy and corporations more than Bush did. To restate:
      Bush cut by $4 trillion ($3.8 trillion + $180 billion). Obama cut by $325 billion
      (’09) + $803 billion (’10-11) then by $5 trillion (2012). That’s $4 trillion (Bush)
      and $6.1 trillion (Obama). Then came Trump’s $4.5 trillion in 2018. Trump promised
      during the 2016 election to cut taxes by $5 trillion. And he roughly did. The
      2018 tax cut over the next decade cost $4.5 trillion. His administration, with
      the media and professional economist class in tow, estimated the $4.5 trillion
      at only $1.9 trillion. Trump’s Treasury Secretary at the time, Steve Mnuchin,
      even publicly declared the Trump tax cuts would ‘pay for themselves’. By that
      he meant the tax cuts would boost US GDP and the economy so much that economic
      growth would result in a rise in so much more tax revenues over the decade that
      would offset the $1.9T. To quote Mnuchin at the time : “we believe the tax cuts
      will pay for themselves over a 10 year period of time.” Proof that the Trump 2018
      tax cuts were $4.5T — not $1.9T — was reflected in the Trump administration’s
      budget forecast and a US federal deficit reduction of $4.6 trillion over the decade
      2018-28. An even more convincing later piece of evidence was the US Congressional
      Budget Office, the research arm of Congress, that estimated in 2025 that the cost
      of the 2018 tax cuts were at least $4 trillion total! For several years in debates
      with professional mainstream economists like Robert Reich and Paul Krugman this
      writer kept showing the Trump tax cuts weren’t $1.9 trillion but actually $4.5
      trillion. Here’s how. First, the $1.9 trillion official estimate was based on
      the assumption that the US economy would grow over the next ten years, 2018-28,
      by 3%-3.5% annually. A forecast that proved grossly inaccurate in fact. After
      a modest growth in 2018-19, the US economy crashed in 2020 as the government ordered
      a partial economic shutdown in response to Covid. The economy haltingly reopened
      and recovered in stages in 2021. Thereafter it grew only moderately from 2022-24.
      That modest three year GDP recovery followed the massive $10.7 trillion fiscal
      and monetary stimulus by Congress and the Federal Reserve during the years 2020-22:
      $6.7 trillion in fiscal stimulus and another $4 trillion in monetary stimulus
      by the Federal Reserve Bank. In other words, a mountain of stimulus brought forth
      a molehill of GDP. Second, the 2018 tax cut estimate grossly under-estimated and
      failed to account for the magnitude of tax cuts that accrued to US multinational
      corporations offshore. The largest 108 US Fortune 500 corporations with offshore
      subsidiaries had accumulated $2.7 trillion in their corporate offshore accounts
      they weren’t returning to the US in order to avoid paying the then 35% corporate
      tax rate. Estimates of un-repatriated hoarded profits from the offshore operations
      of US multinationals were as high as $4 to $5 trillion. Trump’s 2018 tax cuts
      allowed them to bring back those profits and pay only 10%. That’s a 25% tax saving
      on at least $4 trillion. The US Commerce Dept. estimated in 2020 US multinationals
      brought back only $750 billion in 2018 and another $250 billion in 2019. They
      thus paid 10% or $100 billion instead of 35% or $350 billion. They pocketed the
      other $900 billion of the $1 trillion repatriated. No government records were
      kept after 2019 unfortunately. What did they do with the $900 billion they did
      repatriate? As the Wall St. Journal reported on January 28, 2020: “Much of what
      firms retrieved went to buybacks”. After averaging about $125 billion per quarter
      in 2017, S&P 500 stock buybacks surged to $200 billion per quarter in 2018 and
      2019. And what happened to the other roughly $3-$4 trillion plus US corporations
      never repatriated? They hoarded the remaining $3 to $4 trillion profits in their
      offshore subsidiaries to avoid taxes. Another loophole allowed them to convert
      their cash profits from overseas operations into short term financial securities
      held offshore, on which they didn’t have to pay any profits. And there was another
      way they avoided taxes: they manipulated their internal pricing — i.e. what US
      located operations charged or paid their foreign subsidiaries. They paid their
      foreign subsidiaries higher prices for components or final products, thereby shifting
      profits offshore where they were booked at lower tax rates, which also raised
      costs in the US and thus lower profits taxed at the higher rate. The 2018 Trump
      tax act also raised the amount US multinational corps paid to foreign countries
      that they could then deduct from their US taxes owed. The point is these offshore
      rules and loopholes that grossly reduced the total tax cuts by at least $2 trillion
      over ten years, 2018-28, that were grossly under-estimated or were not accounted
      for in the 2018 Trump official $1.9 trillion tax cut cost estimates. In summary,
      phony assumptions about a decade of future GDP growth, reduced taxation on repatriated
      profits, and loopholes reducing taxes due on their offshore subsidiary operations
      all meant US multinational corporations’ tax cuts were far greater than reported.
      These assumptions and loopholes meant the 2018 cuts were $4.5 trillion not the
      ‘official’ $1.9 trillion. Thus total tax cuts for 2001-19 were $14.6 trillion
      . Thereafter followed the 2020 Covid fiscal stimulus package during Trump’s last
      year in office, 2020. Taxes were cut another $950 billion as part of the ‘CARES
      Act’ fiscal stimulus passed by Congress March 2020 and another $ 260 billion in
      tax cutting in the emergency ‘Consolidated Appropriations Act’ passed that December
      as the US economy faltered again. That $1.2 trillion in 2020 tax cuts was followed
      in 2021 by Biden’s subsequent ‘AMERICAN RELIEF PLAN’ fiscal stimulus which cut
      taxes by a further $640 billion. In 2022 Biden thereafter shifted some of the
      unspent relief for social programs in his American Relief Plan and redirected
      the funds to a new round of three business investment stimulus programs costing
      $1.7 trillion: the Infrastructure Act the Chips & Modernization Act the misnamed
      Inflation Reduction Act which was mostly tax cuts and subsidies to energy companies,
      alternative and fossil fuel Those three 2022 business investment Acts together
      cut taxes by another roughly $500 billion. Adding all the tax cuts from 2001 thru
      2024, both parties — two Republican and two Democrat administrations — together
      cut taxes by almost $17 trillion ! No one should therefore be surprised that Trump
      2025 is cutting taxes again by another $5 trillion — and once more mostly for
      business, investors and wealthiest households. A massive tax cutting has been
      going on for a quarter century since 2001. (One can argue the trend extends even
      further back, to Reagan’s 1981 and 1986 tax cuts and Clinton’s 1997-98 cuts).
      It’s all part of the long term Neoliberal era (1979-present) fiscal policy: cut
      taxes on the rich and their corporations offset the cost of the tax cuts in part
      with social spending program cuts increase spending on defense and wars ignore
      the effects of all that on budget deficits and national debt that result in rising
      interest payments to US bondholders to $1 trillion dollars per year Long term
      historical studies show conclusively that tax cuts, and reduced tax revenues from
      slow economic growth, fraud, legal avoidance, are responsible for 60% of budget
      deficits. The other major forces driving US budget deficits and national debt
      since 2001 are: the $9 trillion spent on foreign wars in the first quarter of
      the 21 st century the two big bailouts of 2008-09 ($787 billion +), 2020 ($3.1
      billion) and 2021 ($1.9 billion); the chronic price gouging by health and insurance
      corporations escalating the costs of government health support programs ( Medicare
      , Medicaid, Schip, ACA) rising interest payments on the national debt to investors
      (US and foreign) purchasing US Treasury securities So loss of tax revenue from
      25 years of tax cuts and slower long term economic growth ($17 trillion), the
      $9 trillion thrown away in forever wars since 2001, the bailout costs ($5.8 trillion),
      and healthcare price gouging ($0.5 trillion?) together explain most of the current
      $36.2 trillion US national debt. In short, a fiscal train wreck has been running
      down the tracks for at least the past 25 years and Trump’s $5 trillion ‘Big Beautiful
      Bill’ (BBB) — along with trillions more for defense and wars — are shifting that
      train into another higher gear. Trump, Budget Deficits and National Debt US budget
      deficits have been averaging $2 trillion annually and rising since 2016. They
      are projected to rise another $2 trillion in 2025 even before Trump’s tax cuts
      take effect this year. The national debt is just the accumulation of annual budget
      deficits. In 2000 the US national debt was $5.6 trillion. After eight more years
      it nearly doubled to $10.7 trillion. It then did double under Obama to $20 trillion
      by end of 2016. Trump added $7.8 trillion in the four years of his first term
      and Biden added another $8.5 trillion in just four years more. By the end of his
      Biden’s term in December 2024 the national debt had risen to $36.2 trillion. By
      the way, as that rises to $38 trillion by year end 2025 and $56 trillion by 2034,
      it does not include the Federal Reserve Bank’s balance sheet debt (now $8 trillion)
      or state and local governments’ debt load of several trillions$ more. Future Consequences
      It’s ironic Trump has chosen to call his tax cuts and defense spending hikes proposal
      the Big Beautiful Bill — or BBB as Congress refers to it. For in the world of
      business finance, BBB refers to the worst run corporations that are overloaded
      with high risk debt (triple B grade). Triple B rating makes them the most financially
      fragile and at greatest risk of default and bankruptcy. While it’s not likely
      the USA federal government can ever go bankrupt or even default on its annual
      payments of $1 to $1.7 trillion to bondholders of the national debt. All it needs
      do is ‘print’ more money, either by adding accounts to the Federal Reserve electronically
      — or perhaps in the near future by creating digital currency. But while that may
      not mean bankruptcy, it could very well mean a collapse of the value of the US
      dollar globally. That in turn could result in the abandonment of the dollar as
      the global reserve and trading currency. And that in a collapse of the recycling
      of US dollars back to the USA by foreign holders of excess dollars. In such case,
      the US annual budget can’t be financed, requiring then massive spending cuts and
      tax hikes. In other words, the end of the US global empire. Trump’s tax cuts and
      spending bill is just another iteration of Neoliberal fiscal policy, this time
      on steroids. But Neoliberal fiscal policy is broken. That is, it does not produce
      the same stimulus to the real economy, real investment, and GDP growth that it
      had in decades past. Increasing magnitudes of fiscal stimulus is required in order
      to generate the same, or even smaller, real GDP growth. What fiscal policy does
      result in increasingly is a stimulus to financial asset markets, in US and globally,
      and thus a continued rise in stocks, bonds, forex, derivatives and other financial
      instruments’ price. Or the tax cuts are redirected by multinational corporations
      that receive them to offshore investment and operations. In other words, to subsidize
      the expansion of US capital expansion offshore. Both the financialization and
      globalization of investment are characteristic of trends in the 21 st century
      capitalist economy. A similar effect applies to US monetary policy: more and more
      of the Federal Reserve’s injection of money into the economy gets diverted to
      financial markets and to offshore. Perhaps the best evidence of this is the $10.7
      trillion in fiscal and monetary stimulus by Congress and the Federal Reserve injected
      in 2020-22. It should have produced a massive GDP growth expansion in 2022-24.
      It produced a mere historical average of barely 2%. All of the media, economists,
      and government officials’ about the Trump tax cuts and BBB Act stimulating the
      real economy — i.e. wages, jobs, investment, etc. — is just economic hype. The
      2018 tax cuts didn’t. Nor did Obama’s and Bush’s before that. Trump’s current
      BBB Act won’t do any different. Fiscal and monetary policy in the late Neoliberal
      era — in the 21 st century American capitalism and global economic empire — are
      failing. Nevertheless, America’s elite are doubling down on their tax cutting
      for the rich and their wars of defense of Empire. Jack Rasmus is author of the
      recently published book, ‘The Scourge of Neoliberalism: US Economic Policy from
      Reagan to Trump’, Clarity Press, 2020. He publishes at Predicting the Global Economic
      Crisis'

      focus on the specifics of the Trump Tax Cuts while neglecting the broader fiscal
      crisis stemming from ongoing tax cuts, escalating defense spending, economic instability,

      of 2025.
    paragraph_summary: In a recent article, Jack Rasmus critiques the mainstream media's
      focus on the specifics of the Trump Tax Cuts, arguing that they overlook the broader
      implications of these tax reductions within a historical context. He highlights
      a looming fiscal crisis resulting from a combination of persistent tax cuts since
      2001, escalating defense spending, recurrent economic downturns, and soaring interest
      costs on the national debt, which is projected to reach $38 trillion by the end
      of 2025. Rasmus notes that interest payments are already exceeding $1 trillion
      annually and could rise to $1.7 trillion by 2034, exacerbated by the recent $5
      trillion tax cuts. He emphasizes that the elite's continued tax reductions for
      corporations and the wealthy, alongside unchecked military spending and healthcare
      costs, contribute significantly to the national debt, with studies indicating
      that 60% of budget deficits stem from inadequate tax revenues.

  - title: 'Trump’s ‘Forever War’: US Attacks Iran'
    url: https://jackrasmus.com/2025/06/21/trumps-forever-war-us-attacks-iran/
    text: 'Dr. Jack Rasmus Copyright 2025 After promising during his 2024 election campaign
      to end the country’s quarter century of ‘forever wars’—on June 21, 2025 Trump
      started yet another ‘forever war’ by bombing Iran at multiple locations. He thus
      declared war today on Iran without a formal declaration, much like Japan did with
      the USA on December 7, 1941. Also like Japan in 1941, Trump conducted fake negotiations
      over the past two weeks with Iran as a deception, to make Iran think a deal was
      possible when in fact he never intended a deal. The attack was inevitable days
      ago, once the US started moving two more US carrier task forces to the region,
      removing its naval assets out of its Bahrain and Qatar bases in the Persian Gulf,
      and calling on Americans in the region to leave. All indicators Trump made his
      decision to bomb likely a week ago. The deception of fake negotiations this past
      week continued up to the very last minute. Two days ago Trump announced he was
      giving Iran two weeks more to consider his demands. As he said that, US air force
      B-2 bombers were being fueled, armed and readied for takeoff. Just another deception.
      Trump’s forever war on Iran is like none of the US Empire’s previous neocon wars
      of the 21 st century. This time there was no attempt to provide political or moral
      cover by going to the United Nations, as US presidents did in previous wars in
      Iraq in 1991 and 2003. Nor did Trump make the slightest effort to bring US allies
      on board to support or participate in the attack. Nor was there any pretense of
      invoking the War Powers Act, that imperial fig leaf that has served as cover for
      Presidents violating the US Constitution. All that was bypassed or ignored this
      time, in Trump’s ‘forever war’. Trump’s decision to go to war was strictly personal.
      It was his alone—with US neocons whispering in his one ear and Netanyahu the other.
      That makes Trump’s war a personal act of Tyranny per the basic meaning of that
      term—an act in foreign policy not unlike some of his recent decisions in US domestic
      affairs. Trump’s decision to bomb Iran has all the earmarks of the continuation
      of the US neocon global strategy in the 21 st century. By bombing, Trump reveals
      he is now solidly in the neocon camp—if he ever left it. Trump is now America’s
      No. #1 neocon. No country will ever believe he, or the USA, ever wants to negotiate
      a peaceful settlement to any dispute. That applies especially to countries like
      China and Russia. Why negotiate with the USA? Negotiations are only a ruse. Russia
      found that out in Ukraine. China will no doubt take note in any future discussions
      about Taiwan or South China Sea islands. The empire sees negotiations as a tactic.
      Treaties are only temporary agreements until the US believes the relationship
      of forces are again in its favor, at which point it conveniently breaks treaties.
      ‘Trump’s Iran War’ is a first in the history of 21 st century US neocon military
      adventures.  It is a first in that it is totally on behalf of a foreign country,
      Israel, against a country, Iran, that has not indicated any threat to America
      nor has the capability even if it did. Trump has gone to war with Iran not because
      it is in America’s interest to do so, but because Netanyahu and his Zionists have
      asked him to do so. There is another ‘first’ in Trump’s neocon forever war on
      Iran: Trump started the war in direct contradiction to US intelligence agencies’
      determination that Iran did not have a nuclear weapon and it would take it three
      years to develop one. That was the public statement of the Trump administration’s
      own Director of National Intelligence (DNI), Tulsi Gabbard, to Congress this past
      March. The DNI gathers and summarizes the intelligence findings of the USA’s 17
      intelligence agencies, including the CIA. Trump publicly rejected Gabbard’s conclusions
      in a media interview just days ago, saying ‘she was wrong’. I (Trump) know Iran
      has a weapon’.  So how did Trump know? If his own intelligence apparatus said
      no, why did he say yes? From what source did Trump get his evidence if not from
      the US intelligence apparatus?  It can only be from Israel and its intelligence
      agency, the Mossad. So we have the ‘first’ of a US president believing a foreign
      intelligence source (with a vested interest) against the determination of the
      USA’s own intelligence. The bombing of Iran is clearly the outcome of the two
      forces on the planet that for decades have been pushing for perpetual war—US neocons
      and Israel Zionists. They are now obviously two sides of the same coin.  And together
      the two are obviously driving US foreign policy and wars. President Biden may
      not have had all his mental faculties that enabled the Neocon-Zionist cabal to
      push him to war. What’s Trump’s excuse? With the assistance of the US neocon cabal,
      Israel has become the dog wagging its American tail. To sum up the unique character
      of this latest of US neocon 21 st century wars of empire: Trump’s Iran war is
      a first in the history of US neocon military adventures as it is a war on behalf
      of another country (Israel) against their adversary (Iran) not against any country
      threatening America; it is a first because Trump has bypassed all government processes
      in his march to war; it is a first because Trump has decided to go to war ignoring
      his own US intelligence agencies and instead basing his decision on a foreign
      intelligence agency (Mossad). Some Consequences Trump may believe now that he
      has bombed Iran that it will come to the negotiating table. As he said after the
      event: ‘It’s time for a peace agreement’.  That statement makes him either incredibly
      naïve and stupid, or it’s just another negotiating subterfuge. Why would Iran
      now agree to negotiate a peace deal with him?  Can Iran trust him that a deal
      is possible again, when negotiations were just a deception before? Trump may think
      this bombing ends the war. But it may only have started it. If Iran fought against
      Iraq in the 1980s and lost 1 million men, why would it now capitulate and not
      continue fighting?  Would the USA have done so after being bombed? Did it after
      Pearl Harbor, Manila in the Philippines, Wake and Guam islands that were all bombed
      by Japan on December 7, 1941?  Does Trump and US neocons think that is the likely
      outcome now? It’s possible they are that stupid. They’ve shown evidence before
      of being afflicted with a severe case of geopolitical myopia. It’s extremely unlikely
      Iran will negotiate again.  Its leadership must be aware the more fundamental
      objective of Trump and the US—and especially Israel—is regime change in Iran.
      Not just the bombing of Iran’s nuclear sites. Certainly US neocons and Israel
      know this is the real objective, even if Trump naively now believes he can now
      force Iran to negotiate a deal. It is unclear at this point, moreover, whether
      Iran’s nuclear sites are actually destroyed. Time will tell.  But if so, what’s
      to stop Iran now from accelerating its nuclear program at other sites? The bombing
      may actually force Iran to now build a bomb as fast as it can. Only the total
      military occupation of the country by Israel and/or the USA can prevent that.
      And neither Israel or the USA has a military force remotely capable of doing so,
      let alone of even invading Iran. If the Iranians believe the Trump-Israel objective
      is regime change, why won’t they continue fighting?  After all, Trump has demanded
      their ‘unconditional surrender’. Historically that means military occupation,
      new government, prosecution for alleged war crimes, and execution of former military
      leaders. To continue fighting is obviously a preferable alternative to ‘unconditional
      surrender’, capitulation and war crime tribunals. Trump may have just ‘lit the
      fuse’ on the US empire’s declaration of war on the entire global south.  The bombing
      is a stark warning to all, and especially China, that the US is willing to escalate
      the use of force without limit (including nuclear) in order to preserve its global
      empire now being increasingly challenged by the nations of the global south. With
      Trump’s war on Iran, the ‘forever wars’ not only continue now; they are likely
      to spread and become even more deadly. Trump’s bombing of Iran represents a kind
      of ‘geopolitical Rubicon’ from which there’s now no going back. By Jack Rasmus

    one_sentence_summary: Despite promising to end "forever wars" during his 2024 campaign,
      President Trump initiated a new conflict by bombing Iran on June 21, 2025, after
      conducting deceptive negotiations that suggested a potential deal.
    paragraph_summary: In a surprising turn of events, President Trump, who had vowed
      during his 2024 campaign to end the U.S.'s long-standing military engagements,
      initiated a new conflict by launching airstrikes on Iran on June 21, 2025, without
      a formal declaration of war. This action mirrored Japan's surprise attack on Pearl
      Harbor in 1941, as Trump engaged in deceptive negotiations with Iran just prior
      to the bombings, suggesting a potential deal while secretly preparing for military
      action. The decision to attack was anticipated following the deployment of additional
      U.S. naval forces to the region and a series of misleading public statements.
      Unlike previous military interventions, Trump did not seek approval from the United
      Nations or involve U.S. allies, making the war a unilateral decision influenced
      by neoconservative advisors and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu. This approach
      has raised concerns about the personal nature of Trump's decision, which some
      critics label as an act of tyranny in foreign policy.

    text: 'Dr. Jack Rasmus Copyright 2025 After promising during the 2024 election to
      stop the USA’s ‘forever wars’ in the 21 st century, in less than six months in
      office Donald Trump is about to start another ‘forever’ war with Iran. There’ll
      be no prior vote in Congress, as required by the US Constitution. No seeking support
      of the United Nations or forming a coalition with allies. Nor even a preparation
      of public opinion, apart from the Fox News network that appears completely on
      board. There won’t even be a suspension of the War Powers Act, as occurred in
      previous ‘forever wars’. Trump plans to simply order US aircraft to bomb Iran,
      within days or perhaps even hours. Certainly as soon as the three additional US
      aircraft carrier task forces he’s ordered arrive on station in the Arabian sea
      off Iran’s southern coast. The carriers and planes are there to neutralize Iranian
      coastal and inland anti-aircraft missile forces to create a corridor for US B-2
      strategic bombers flying from USA’s Diego Garcia island airbase in the Indian
      Ocean. The B-2s will drop US made GBU 43 bunker busting bombs on the three or
      more Iranian sites that Israel, and now USA, allege are producing nuclear material
      for use in an Iranian bomb. The US bombing will occur on the flimsiest evidence
      supporting the claim Iran is just weeks away from having a nuclear weapon, as
      the US and Israel leadership and both countries’ media are saying. To the contrary,
      however, UN IAEA inspectors this past March 2025 publicly said there was no evidence
      Iran was near having such a weapon. Tulsi Gabbard, the Director of the US Director
      of National Intelligence, which coordinates all 17 US intelligence services, also
      told Congress that same month there was no evidence. Two days ago as Trump was
      leaving a G7 meeting in Canada he was asked by the media what he thought of Gabbard’s
      view and statement. Trump replied: “I don’t care what she said. I say they’re
      working on a weapon…I don’t listen to her”. So who does Trump listen to? Netanyahu?
      Israel’s CIA-like counterpart, Mossad, instead of US intelligence services? Trump
      will send US planes and bombers into Iran— not to prevent an attack on the USA
      by that country; not in response to an actual or imminent attack by Iran on US
      bases or its 40,000 troops now in west Asia; nor in response to an attack by Iran
      on US warships or any international shipping.  Iran is not at war with the USA
      nor plans to; nevertheless, the USA will soon be at war with Iran. Iran publicly
      offered this past week to sign a treaty saying it has no nuclear weapon and agrees
      not to develop one—a move strongly suggesting it is not concerned US inspectors
      would find anything indicating it has. Trump is thus preparing to take the USA
      into another ‘forever’ war, this time with Iran on behalf of a foreign nation—Israel—simply
      because its leader, Natanyahu, has asked him to do so. The Israeli leader has
      been asking the USA to attack Iran since 2002 when he addressed the US Congress
      on the eve of the USA’s imminent Iraq invasion in 2003. Now he’ll likely get what
      he’s been asking for: the USA to attack Iran on behalf of Israel. Since 2002 Natanyahu
      has cleverly deepened Israel’s influence—and indeed control—of the US government
      through its lobbying group, AIPAC, and other personal connections within the US
      bureaucracy, aka its Deep State. A majority in Congress has already been writing
      a blank check to Israel to cover the costs of its current wars in GAZA, Lebanon
      and Syria. Congress will no doubt rubber stamp quickly any US air attack on Iran,
      in order to legitimize US bombing Iran—an act of war and aggression by America
      by any definition of international law. Like Congress, the US government bureaucracy
      and Deep State is also deeply aligned with Israeli interests, as is the Trump
      administration and the president himself. The two political systems—USA and Israel—are
      fused at the political hip and have been for some time. There has never been anything
      quite like the political integration of the two systems, America and Israel, in
      the entire 250 year history of the USA. Israel is the American Empire’s landlocked
      aircraft carrier looking out over the entire middle east, enforcing US imperial
      interests; America is Israel’s military weapons industry and blank check writer.
      It is estimated more than $340 billion in aid has been given to Israel by the
      US government since the 1970s. Most of which gets recycled back to the US companies
      providing Israel US advanced weaponry. The USA ‘How to Go to War’ Playbook Since
      2001 America has been embroiled in what can only be called wars of empire: Wars
      to expand the empire. Wars to punish those who try to break from it or dare to
      chart an independent path. Wars to pre-emptively attack those who pose a potential
      challenge to it in the future. There have been three defining wars of empire in
      the 21 st century: the Iraq war of 2003-10 (of which the Afghan war was a second
      front). The Ukraine proxy war of 2021-25. And the Israel-Iran proxy war of 2023-25.
      In retrospect, there is a pattern in how the US prepares and initiates war across
      all three. When the US imperial elites—in government, Deep State, and Military
      Industrial Complex—shift the machinery of war into first gear and the war train
      leaves the station there is no calling it back. The gears of war were set in motion
      in 2002 in the case of the Iraq war; in 2021 in Ukraine; and sometime during 2024
      in the current case of Iran. War plans are developed and the funding sources identified
      and earmarked months, and sometimes years, before military action is initiated.
      Once the decision is made what remains is mostly the timing, i.e. when is it best
      to pull the trigger. That timing depends on getting the necessary military assets
      in place, lining up agreement to go to war with key players in Congress and US
      allies, preparing public opinion by creating an imminent threat image with the
      US public, and, if time and conditions permit, staging a ‘false flag’ event to
      give credibility to the imminent threat. Here’s how the playbook works after initial
      preparations, as the US war train shifts into higher gear as evidenced in the
      last three major wars in the 21 st century: Iraq, Ukraine, and Iran: The Case
      of Iraq 2003 First, the US raises a set of demands the target country must meet
      and engages in a period of negotiations with it. In the case of the Iraq war of
      2003 the US charged Iraq with possessing weapons of mass destruction (WMDs) that
      it was planning to use. Who can forget the visuals of Secretary of State Colin
      Powell addressed the UN security council showing charts of African countries from
      where Iraq had purchased ‘yellow cake’ to make nuclear material. WMDs include
      chemical or biological weapons. But Powell’s presentation suggested Iraq’s WMDs
      were also nuclear. UN and US inspectors found no evidence of WMDs in the run up
      to the war. And after the war it was confirmed there were none. That didn’t matter
      at the time. The US War train had left the station months before. Assets and allies,
      Congress and public opinion, were already prepared and in place. In negotiations
      on the eve of war, Iraq agreed to US initial demands.  The US just moved the goalposts.
      It demanded instead of UN IAEA inspectors the Iraqi armed forces submit to the
      occupation of Iraq by US/NATO forces to ensure there were no WMDs. In other words,
      agree to de facto unconditional surrender. The WMD issue was just a cover. The
      real US demand was regime change in Iraq and the deposing of Saddam Hussein as
      the country’s leader and dismantling of his political party. When the US goes
      to war it is always about regime change. The manufactured threat issue is always
      just a cover. Negotiations are never intended to reach a compromise. They are
      just a tactic. The US war prep playbook is to never agree to a deal via negotiations
      but only make it appear one is possible. The US raises new, more unacceptable
      demands and ignores concessions offered by the target country as a basis for a
      deal. Negotiations are thus used to lull the opponent into thinking a compromise
      is possible when in fact no deal will ever be agreed to. However, as the US ratchets
      up demands and moves the goalposts, it issues public statements in parallel that
      discussions are going well and negotiators are getting closer to a deal to avert
      war. In the weeks just prior to the Iraq war erupting, Saddam offered UN and US
      inspectors free access to all sites, including military, in Iraq to determine
      there were no WMDs. The US ignored Saddam’s offers. WMDs were just the pretext.
      It was always about regime change. It always is. And then when all assets are
      in place, the war hammer drops. An attack is launched by surprise with no prior
      indication or warning. The parallels with the current imminent US war with Iran
      are notable. The Case of Iran 2025 Ever since the collapse of Syria in late 2024
      and Trump’s ascendancy to the presidency, the US has been using negotiations to
      lull Iran into thinking a deal was possible to avert a US involvement in Israel’s
      war with Iran.  When Iran agreed last week to sign a treaty indicating it had
      no bomb and would not develop one in the future, the US moved the negotiations
      goalposts: it demanded the Iranians open up their military sites to US and Israeli
      inspectors to verify if nuclear production machinery was creating fissionable
      material. The US further demanded Iran turn over its entire existing stock of
      fissionable uranium.  Iran agreed to do so for all its excess material except
      for what was needed to run its civilian nuclear power plants. It offered to turn
      over all its excess stock of uranium to be managed by a third party, in this case
      Russia. The US responded Iran must turn over all its uranium stock, including
      that needed to run its civilian nuclear generating plants. In other words, Iran
      had to shut down its civilian nuclear power plants. As negotiations proceeded
      last week, Trump publicly declared the US and Iran was close to a deal. He added
      the situation looked promising and a deal was likely on Sunday, June 15, when
      US and Iranian teams were scheduled to meet again. Within 48 hours of Trump saying
      a deal was imminent, Israel launched its surprise attack on Iran. It is naïve
      to believe Trump had no knowledge of Israel’s surprise attack launched in Friday,
      June 13. He as much indicated he knew. And he knew such an attack would lead to
      a cancelling of June 15 negotiations. He knew no deal was imminent. Negotiations
      had served their purpose to lull Iran into thinking a deal was possible, even
      imminent. Whether this tactic resulted in Iran leaving its guard down on June
      13 cannot be known for certain. What is certain is that Israel’s June 13 attack
      wiped out much of Iran’s air defense system and giving Israel aircraft more or
      less free entry into Iran air space to bomb not only military facilities but power
      plants throughout the country, including nuclear, as well. It was the Israeli
      version of Colin Powell’s ‘shock and awe’ prediction of the prior US air war launch
      on Iraq. Israel’s surprise attack not only neutralized many of Iran’s air defense
      facilities but Israel simultaneously carried out assassinations of high ranking
      Iranian military, government officials as well as civilian Iranian scientists.
      Israel thus included a ‘decapitation’ strategy, which had previously proved successful
      with Hamas in GAZA and Hezbollah in Lebanon. Purposely targeting and decapitating
      civilians is considered a war crime. So is targeting civilian nuclear facilities.
      In the initial attack Israel bombed several, with reported nuclear radiation fallout
      occurring in several locations in the country. To sum up: the US Iran war playbook
      has followed much of that employed by the USA in Iraq: engage in negotiations
      to lull the opponent into thinking a deal is possible. Keep moving the demands
      goalpost as the opponent makes concessions. Use a pretext like WMDs (Iraq) or
      nuclear bomb in weeks (Iran) to maneuver public opinion in support of the war.
      And as in the case of Iraq, the actual goal is regime change. Military action
      is designed to achieve political objectives. Launching a surprise massive air
      campaign is to inflict as much damage on the economy and disable the government
      in order to spark political uprisings to depose the regime and its leaders. Neither
      WMDs or a nuclear bomb are ever the real issue or objectives. They are the excuse
      to launch a massive military air strike to wreck the economy and create political
      instability and engineer regime change. And negotiations in the run up to war
      are a tactic, not a step in a process to reach a compromise and a deal to avert
      war. Their purpose is to lull the opponent into thinking a deal is possible when
      it isn’t. When the US playbook believes pretexts and excuses like WMDs or nuclear
      bombs are not sufficient to invade, it adds a ‘false flag’ operation to the playbook.
      Some notable false flags from earlier US wars include the alleged ‘Tonkin Gulf’
      attack by North Vietnam boats on US destroyers that was used to justify US expanding
      its war in Vietnam; the claim the Cuban army had invaded Grenada and seized US
      medical students as hostage; the charge that Panama president Noriega was running
      a drug operation transporting Colombia cocaine to American cities as justification
      for the US invasion of that country in 1989; the claim that Assad, president of
      Syria, was using chemical weapons; Iraqis in 1990 were killing Kuwaiti babies
      in incubators.  Every US war playbook engineers a pretext and/or a false flag
      operation leading up to initiating  military action. The Case of Ukraine The case
      of Ukraine is a variation on these themes.  In 2014 following the US financed
      and CIA directed coup in that country, Russia occupied Crimea to prevent NATO
      from seizing its naval base there, which would have led to NATO occupying the
      entire Black Sea.  There were brief military conflicts in eastern Ukraine, followed
      by negotiations and a cease fire in a Minsk Agreement between Russia, Ukraine
      and Europe. Germany’s then Chancellor, Merkle, and France’s president, Holland,
      served as guarantors of the Minsk agreement. Later in 2022 they would both admit
      publicly the purpose of the Minsk negotiations and deal was to lull Russia into
      thinking the military conflict as over. Ukraine was not militarily prepared to
      go to war yet. It would require 8 more years to prepare massive fortifications
      and weapons development and training of troops before it was. The US/NATO decision
      to go to war with Russia in Ukraine was made by US president Biden around June
      2021 when he met with Putin for the first, and last time. The US plans for the
      Ukraine war date back to 2015. They were shelved when Trump won in 2016 and thereafter
      quickly dusted off by Biden when he took office in January 2021. Biden in August
      2021 ‘cleared the decks’ in Afghanistan by pulling out. US advisors and weapons
      thereafter began pouring into Ukraine. Putin attempted to ‘negotiate’ with the
      US from afar during the rest of 2021 without any progress. The US-Ukraine plan
      called for a major Ukraine offensive in February 2022 to defeat what remained
      of the local Russian ethnic resistance in Ukraine’s two eastern provinces, Lughansk
      and Donetsk. But the Russians pre-empted that and invaded first in late February.
      Russian advances were swift even though it invaded with barely 90,000 troops across
      a combat line of 1500 kilometers from Kiev to south Donetsk. That limited force
      was no where near sufficient to occupy Kiev or conquer Ukraine. Its purpose was
      intimidation to force Ukraine into a compromise deal which was tentatively reached
      in Istanbul, Turkey. As discussions in Istanbul were occurring, Russia was asked
      to show good faith by withdrawing its forces from Kiev which it did. A tentative
      deal was then reached between Ukraine and Russia in Istanbul in April 2022 which
      was quite favorable to Ukraine. However, NATO convinced Ukraine president Zelensky
      to reject the deal and to continue the war. The Istanbul negotiations collapsed.
      Twice Russia was lulled into negotiations to ‘buy time’, as Merkle and Holland
      admitted in 2015 with the Minsk deal and Ukraine did again in April 2022. US/NATO
      rushed in weaponry and advisers after Istanbul and Ukraine launched a major offensive
      that threw Russian forces back from Kiev and other locations to limited positions
      in Lughansk and Donetsk.  Thus Russia was out-maneuvered twice by negotiations
      with US/Ukraine that were never intended to conclude with a compromise deal to
      end the war in Ukraine. As in the cases of Iraq and now Iran, from the outset
      the US playbook in Ukraine proxy sought the ultimate objective of regime change
      in Russia.  The admitted strategy was a military conflict in Ukraine, financed
      and provided with weapons by NATO, which the plan envisioned would lead to a collapse
      of the Russian economy, political instability, and the deposing of Putin by Russian
      oligarchs and military. The US neocon and CIA analysis was Russia’s economy was
      weak and the Putin government even weaker. A military conflict, supported by extensive
      sanctions on Russia’s economy was argued in US war planning to lead to Russian
      implosion and NATO/Ukraine victory. Regime change was again the objective. Negotiations
      at Minsk in 2015 or Istanbul in 2022 were never meant to reach a deal but to lull
      Russia into thinking one was possible. In 2025 the US and EU again tried to lure
      Russia into a negotiation that demanded as a precondition to negotiations that
      Russia agree to a ceasefire first. The preconditions in turn allowed Ukraine to
      rearm and mobilize and train more troops during negotiations. It was clear the
      US/NATO 2024 proposal was another example of negotiations employed as a tactic
      to ‘buy time’ to prepare for another military offensive—after which the pretext
      of negotiations would be dropped. This time, however, Russia did not agree to
      ceasefire first and then negotiations. Nor will it again agree to negotiations
      as a delaying tactic after twice being manipulated and out-maneuvered in 2015
      and 2022. Unlike in the cases of Iraq in 2003 and Iran today, in the case of Russia
      the US playbook’s negotiations tactic as well as its strategic objective of regime
      change have both conclusively failed. What’s Next in the US-Israel Proxy War On
      Iran? The official position of the USA is that it isn’t involved in Israel’s war
      with Iran. Few believe that given the US provision of weapons to Israel, likely
      planning the operation for months, and obvious US satellite surveillance and targeting
      assistance.  As US official spokespersons deny US involvement, Trump himself publicly
      refers to the Israel attack as “we”, calls on Iran to ‘unconditionally surrender’
      and says the US knows where Iranian leader Khamenei is located and could ‘take
      him out’ any time. All of which hardly suggests no USA involvement. Will the US
      then overtly escalate its involvement by bombing suspected Iranian nuclear weapons
      development sites deep inside several mountains. No one yet knows for certain
      but it is very likely Trump will do so. But what if the US GBU 43 ‘bunker busting’
      bombs do not achieve their objective and destroy Iranian deep mountain sites?
      The only further weapon that can is a tactical nuclear US bomb. Will it risk that?
      It is likely should Trump allow B-2s to drop bunker buster bombs that Iran will
      attack US naval bases in the Persian gulf located in Bahrain and elsewhere. The
      same response may occur should US carrier plans attack Iran’s Persian Gulf ports
      and naval installations. A large contingent of US naval forces are stationed in
      Bahrain. What happens if the Gulf erupts in military conflict? One outcome is
      certain: global oil and gas prices will quickly rise and so will US consumer energy
      costs and inflation in general. There is also the question what will Russia, now
      a signatory to a mutual Russia-Iran defense agreement since January, do in response
      to a US direct military involvement in Iran? It is difficult to imagine Russia
      will not come to Iran’s defense. That would greatly undermine its credibility
      everywhere. Nor will China remain neutral. Reports are it is already shipping
      weapons to Iran by air. It is very unlikely Russia or China will permit its ally
      Iran to be militarily defeated or its government to collapse. And then there’s
      Pakistan that has vowed to provide Iran with nuclear weapons if either Israel
      or US use them on Iran. Can an air attack by Israel, with or without the USA,
      actually succeed in bringing about regime change in Iran? That too is extremely
      unlikely.  Iran is not Libya. Its leadership is not isolated from public support,
      as was Assad in Syria. It is difficult to see how the Israel air attack, despite
      some of its initial successes, can succeed in the longer term in bringing about
      the primary objective of Iranian regime change. What then? Can Netanyahu then
      agree to compromise after significant Israeli military bases and urban areas have
      been seriously damaged by Iranian hypersonic missiles that have shown to penetrate
      Israeli air defenses and will continue to do so? Iran has a population of 92 million
      and has shown it will sacrifice millions dead in its 1980s war with Iraq if necessary.
      Neither the US or Israel have sufficient ground forces with which to invade Iran.
      Israel is a population of 10m with military forces engaged in GAZA, Lebanon and
      recently Syria. It would be a disaster for the US to invade Iran with ground troops.
       Even an air attack on Iranian sites risks significant US losses of aircraft.
      Trump should remember the disastrous US air invasion of Iran during the Carter
      administration to attempt to rescue US hostages in Tehran. It failed miserably,
      with the US losing several aircraft on the attempted entry. Despite these likelihoods
      US neocons like Lindsey Graham now call for the commitment of US troops to Iran.
      Thus proving once again that neocons never compromise or admit defeat; once their
      plans fail they simply double down and call for further escalation. Trump should
      also consider the effect of a decision to bomb Iran on his domestic base. The
      initial phase of a MAGA movement realignment in domestic US politics may impale
      itself on Trump’s escalation in Iran. Already significant voices in the MAGA movement
      are challenging Trump’s imminent decision to bomb: Tucker Carlson, Steve Bannon,
      and a growing list of MAGA members in Congress. Millions of American voters in
      2024 no doubt voted for Trump last November in part because of his campaign promise
      to end America’s ‘forever wars’. Bombing Iran after less than six months in office
      will reveal that was just another fake election campaign pledge that presidents
      feed the public for votes, then turn around and do the bidding of the neocons
      who’ve been running US foreign policy since 2001, the US military industrial complex
      and their Deep State allies in America. Should Trump soon decide to bomb Iran
      that act will likely unleash global and domestic US responses not easily contained
      by the Trump administration. Trump’s advisers should remind him not only of Carter’s
      disastrous invasion in 1979, but of Nixon’s bombing of North Vietnam which only
      accelerated the collapse of US’s war in Vietnam. Air wars are successful only
      when targeting small weak military state opponents. They worked with Serbia, Libya,
      in Sudan, and such. Even in Iraq and Afghanistan US ground troops had to be committed
      and then were forced to leave. And this time the US simply has no sufficient ground
      forces, short of reinstituting a draft. Europe has even less. Trump’s decision
      to bomb Iran will result in forces of global and domestic US political entropy
      spinning out of his control. But like the US neocon community—which Trump has
      now apparently joined—looking beyond the immediate situation to possible consequences
      is not part of their mental apparatus nor in either of their war time playbooks.
      Looking back in the months to come, the USA proxy war in Ukraine may be understood
      as the dress rehearsal to World War III. But a US-Israel war on Iran will be understood
      as the actual start of a global conflict. Dr. Jack Rasmus Copyright 2025'

    text: 'There is an emerging debate whether the US Empire is about to collapse or
      in decline (or neither). In my forthcoming book, ‘Twilight of American Imperialism’,
      forthcoming this fall this debate is discussed as part of the book’s history and
      evolution of the American Empire from 1768 to the present. The main focus of the
      book is the contemporary period since 2008 and especially since 2020 and its analysis
      that, while the Empire is not about to collapse, it is clearly in a state of decline
      and a decline that’s accelerating. Special attention is given to the current Trump
      regime and a discussion of the question whether Trump policies can stop or even
      slow the decline. The following is the draft Introduction to the book where the
      main themes are outlined and briefly discussed. Here’s the Intro INTRODUCTORY
      CHAPTER Twilight of American Imperialism: By Jack Rasmus Copyright 2024 Mid way
      through the third decade of the 21 st century it is becoming increasingly clear
      the American empire has been growing steadily weaker across various dimensions—political,
      economic, cultural and even technological. Some say it has entered a period of
      decline. A few—prone perhaps to substitute wishful thinking for hard analysis—even
      go so far as to predict its imminent collapse. Those advocating imminent collapse
      point to the USA’s military defeat and pullout of Afghanistan in 2021; the increasing
      likelihood of US exit from its proxy war against Russia in Ukraine after three
      years and $350 billion dollars cost; the growing economic and geopolitical influence
      of China and its deepening alliance with Russia; advances in military technologies
      & weaponry by Russia and China that the US appears to lack (hypersonic missiles,
      mass drones, certain naval assets, etc.); the expansion of the BRICS in the global
      south; the drift of a growing list of countries from the use of the US dollar
      in trade and as a reserve currency and from use of the US’s SWIFT international
      payments system; and so on. While certainly weaker, and arguably in decline, the
      American empire is nowhere near imminent collapse.  Its currency, the dollar,
      is still the majority currency in use in global goods transactions and money capital
      flow settlements. So too still is its SWIFT international payments system that
      runs through the large US commercial banks. Its central bank, the Federal Reserve,
      still functions as the ‘central bank of central banks’ with which most countries’
      central banks move mostly in tandem. Since 1980, via massive money capital flows
      and FDI (foreign direct investment), US company presence and production has expanded
      throughout the world. The USA still provides the majority funding and controls
      voting in strategic economic institutions like the IMF and World Bank, even as
      China’s ‘Belt and Road’ initiative is mounting a major challenge to the latter.
      The USA still has the largest and most comprehensive global agreements on free
      trade. It maintains a leading role in the development of next generation technologies
      like Artificial Intelligence that constitute the future of new product lines even
      though China is nearly equal.  Militarily, the US spends more on weapons and defense
      than all other countries combined, maintains more than 800 bases worldwide, has
      more bilateral military alliances than any other country, and maintains the largest
      naval force with a dozen of aircraft super-carriers and scores of nuclear submarines,
      each of which carry hundreds of Trident II nuclear missile warheads and are essentially
      undetectable. It provides the majority of funding for NATO and economically props
      up the European economy in divers ways. Its CIA and NGOs have engineered scores
      of regime changes in recent decades in smaller countries throughout the world
      that have dared to act independently of its imperial interests. It dominates the
      G7 ‘core’ US empire countries’ and exercises significant political influence over
      the foreign policies of countries like Japan, South Korea, Pacific Islands and
      in Europe and wherever it maintains large US military forces and bases. In support
      of their view of imminent collapse, its advocates further point as confirming
      evidence to the Trump administration’s recent radical changes in its US military
      commitments in Ukraine; its shutting off of funding to US NGOs like USAID; the
      administration’s increasing feud and distancing of relations with European NATO
      members; its attempt to radically transform trade relations, propose deep cuts
      to fiscal spending programs; the administration’s aggressive reordering of US
      immigration and other legal relations;  and Trump’s emerging conflict with US
      central bank chair, Powell, over interest rates. But simply citing policy differences
      one may deeply disagree with does not constitute causal evidence of how such policies
      lead inevitably to Empire decline, let alone collapse. Challenging this often
      politically biased—and to some extent US mainstream media propaganda—view, in
      this book it will be argued that what appears as chaotic radical shifts in policy
      and political initiatives by the Trump administration should be more appropriately
      understood as an effort by the US elite (at least the segment of it supporting
      Trump) to restructure US domestic and global economic and political relations
      in order to consolidate and continue to fund its Empire in an era of growing challenges
      to Empire and its rising costs—especially given the USA domestic economy’s increasing
      failure to grow sufficiently to cover those rising costs. The imminent collapse
      of Empire viewpoint also assumes Trump policies in his second term will fail and
      that failure will itself accelerate imminent collapse.  This view is backed by
      little evidence to date as well, however. Trump policies and initiatives are better
      understood as the opposite: i.e. an attempt to slow and even halt the decline
      of Empire. Alternatively viewed, Trump’s policies and initiatives are about trying
      to check and reverse American’s emerging imperial decline. Whether they will succeed
      in that regard, however, remains to be seen. The odds are likely against it, but
      who knows for certain. A central theme of the book is that the American Empire
      is approaching a period in which it needs to restructure its imperial relations,
      practices and institutions. It cannot afford the cost of the Empire as currently
      structured. US elite policies and practices thus far in the 21 st century have
      not succeeded in expanding or even maintaining the Empire. An Imperial ‘Rubicon’
      may have been crossed in 2008. And if not in 2008, certainly circa 2020-22 after
      the double shock events of the Covid economic shutdown that was quickly followed
      by the Empire’s geopolitical defeat in its Ukraine proxy war and the economic
      fallout from that latter event. Collectively US elite policies and strategic decisions
      the last quarter century have been undermining—not advancing—the Empire, it will
      be further argued. Thus a fundamental restructuring is needed if the American
      Empire is to approximating its prior hegemonic role or exert anything even approaching
      the influence it once had during its peak from 1945 to 2007. If the thesis is
      correct that a restructuring—not a collapse—of empire is imminent, the current
      will prove the fourth such restructuring during the past century undergone by
      the American Empire. Each restructuring of economic and political relations served
      to advance and/or maintain the Empire. The most recent three restructurings of
      the Empire occurred 1913-1919, 1944-1953, and 1980-1986. A Brief History of American
      Imperial Restructurings Chapter one of this book will review and critique the
      major theories of Imperialism. It will argue that most of these describe 19 th
      and 20 th century Euro-centric empires and fail to appropriately describe the
      American way of Empire.  The American imperial experience differs in certain key
      aspects, which is described in chapter two and subsequent chapters. Chapter two
      of this book describes the evolution of the American Empire as it broke out of
      and emerged from its parent British Empire in the mid to late 18 th century. It
      retained some of the characteristics of the British at the time, but its essential
      drive in its early history was twofold: clear away the competing European empires
      on the north American continent—the Spanish in the far south, the remaining British
      on its undefined periphery border to the north, the last vestiges of the French
      in the Mississippi-Missouri valleys and later, toward the mid-19 th century, the
      Mexican in the southwest and far west. The second thrust of America’s continental
      imperial expansion in the 18 th -19 th centuries was to displace, destroy or otherwise
      move native American tribes off the Land by physically destroying them in wars
      or by disease, pushing and resettling them ever further west, or encapsulating
      and isolating them in small enclaves called reservations. In either case—whether
      eliminating European competitors or native American tribes—the main objective
      of the early American Empire has always been Land. Not just land for purposes
      of farming but also for minerals, animal harvesting for the market, precious metals,
      lumber, grazing, and water resource control.  It followed that central to the
      nature of early American imperial continental expansion was land speculation and
      profits from land as a market commodity.  With each wave of westward emigration
      from the east coast colonies and initial states came waves of land speculation
      often even preceding land settlement. In its earliest forms, therefore, American
      imperialism was not just ‘land grabbing’ but land for purposes of financial and
      capitalist appropriation and exploitation. This land acquisition financial imperialism
      was unlike its British parent. Britain’s empire considered its north American
      colonies as a source of natural resource extraction, using native americans as
      the ‘producers’ who provided the animal furs and products to it for resell back
      in England; or, the colonies’ producing lumber and farm products for shipment
      as well. British policy was to prohibit the acquisition of lands west of the colonies
      by the colonialists. It was a major source of contention and one of several issues
      that provoked the US war of independence with Britain in 1775-83. As details in
      chapter two will show, the newly independent USA’s 1787 Constitution represents
      an imperial restructuring, the first, for America. Concurrent with America’s continental
      Empire building in its countless wars with native americans, from 1776 until the
      closing of the ‘frontier’ circa 1890s, was its war with Mexico in the 1840s which
      was concocted on the flimsiest excuses in order to conclude the final seizure
      of land on the continent in the southwest and far west. (Not counting the 1867
      purchase of Alaska from the Russian Tzars).  Once the continent was secured for
      Empire, only then did the Empire turn its gaze offshore in 1898. During that long
      interim from 1775 to 1890s the initial restructuring of 1787 served to enable
      and maintain imperial expansion westward across the continent. That initial restructure
      worked for continental expansion, but would not for offshore global expansion,
      the first of which was attempted by the Empire in 1898 in a war with Spain. The
      land grabbing was for the Caribbean island of Cuba and lesser islands and for
      Spain’s huge colony in the far west Pacific Ocean, the Philippines. The conquest
      of Spain occurred fairly quickly but the pacification of the inhabitants of the
      Philippines dragged on for years, until at least 1902, and was very costly. The
      US Empire realized it needed greater resources and a larger Army and Navy to play
      the new role of Imperialist beyond a north American continent scale. In the empire’s
      first offshore imperial expansion in the 1898-1902 Spanish-American war, the costs
      of war were financed by taxing the property of wealthy Americans. This did not
      work well and generated much political opposition among wealthy interests who
      were taxed. Without a central bank, monetary policy and bond financing to pay
      for the war was difficult as well. The US Treasury was not able to provide the
      bond financing for war expenditures. The US economy had just recovered from the
      great depression of 1892-98. In short, the tax base built mostly on tariffs was
      insufficient for covering the costs of global empire expansion. 1898 was a lesson
      for the need of restructuring fiscal policy rather than an experience in one Not
      so World War I. As the US prepared to play a role in World War I, it restructured
      its fiscal and monetary policies in order to fund and afford the costs of imperial
      expansion: It created a central bank, the Federal Reserve, in 1913 to raise bond
      debt and it passed for the first time a corporate and an individual income tax
      and introduced inheritance taxation. These fiscal and monetary measures became
      the source by which the US paid for the build up of a world class military and
      funded its involvement in that war. A combination of direct taxation and sales
      of bond issues—the latter of which was extended to sales to the general public—became
      the primary source of war finance for the new imperial initiative in World War
      I. During and after the war the USA assumed a role among European empires as a
      co-player in imperial advancement on the world stage. That meant its ‘external’
      policy—i.e. trade relations, lending of money capital, importance of its currency
      the dollar—all became new areas of policy and part of the restructuring of both
      US domestic relations and external relations. Industrial policy was introduced
      as part of the restructuring as well during the war. US elites mobilized war production
      and created new institutional arrangements with labor and unions as part of the
      World War I restructuring as well. World War I thus introduced the specific arrangement
      of fiscal, monetary, industrial and external policies necessary for the American
      Empire to assume a major role on the global stage in competition with the major
      European empires. Since World War I the US financed its imperial expansion out
      of a combination of taxation of domestic wealth holders, domestic production,
      and debt (bond) financing. In World War II the empire applied a similar war financing
      arrangement of fiscal tax policy and bond issuance policy by the central bank.
      But now on an even greater scale. It raised record bond sales during the war,
      now from the general public as well as from wealthy investors.  It also expanded
      and broadened its tax base. In a series of annual revenue acts by Congress starting
      in 1942, a top tax rate of 90% was imposed on the super wealthy and for the first
      time the tax system was ‘broadened’ to cover taxation of working class wage incomes.
      Also new was payroll deduction of income taxes. Both the working class taxation
      and payroll deduction were written in the revenue bills so to expire at wars end.
      Neither were. Both thus helped fund the American empire’s continued military expansion
      post 1945 and especially increased after 1950 and the Korean war. The Vietnam
      war of the 1960s-73 was similarly financed by a special surtax of incomes and
      bond debt sales by the central bank.  However, those policies now contributed
      to the economic problems in the US domestic economy and global economic hegemony
      weakening thereafter in the 1970s.  The answer was to restore the empire’s financial
      base by measures commencing in the early 1980s that have come to be known as Neoliberalism.
       Neoliberal policies enabled the Empire to expand geographically offshore (aka
      globalization) and to financialize in parallel. As a concept, Neoliberalism should
      thus be best understood as a term that somewhat obfuscates what is actually a
      set of policies (fiscal, monetary, industrial, external) serving to restructure
      American imperialism starting in the 1980s. That policy mix and 1980s neoliberal
      restructuring—the 3 rd such since World War I—continued more or less unchecked
      until late in the first decade of the 21 st century. The expansion of the American
      Empire in the current neoliberal era reached an apex—economically, geopolitically,
      and technologically—roughly around 2005-07.  About the same time US elites shifted
      their methods of war financing and methods for funding empire expansion. That
      is, just as the costs of expanding and maintaining the Empire began to escalate.
      The Apogee of Empire: 2005-07 History will show the first decade of the 21 st
      century was the high mark of the American Empire, especially the years mid-decade
      of 2005-07. It was the apogee of the Empire’s political-military power as well
      as global economic.  Ironically, it was also the period during which changes and
      forces began to coalesce that set in motion the subsequent period of the Empire’s
      initial phase of decline, 2008-2020. In 1999 US elites moved to absorb into NATO
      the east European nations once part of the USSR Warsaw pact.  Poland, Czech Republic
      and Hungary joined. The big NATO move east, however, was in 2004 when Bulgaria,
      Romania, Slovakia, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Slovenia all joined. Following
      that, in 2008 at a conference in Bucharest, NATO led by US elites’ announced Georgia
      and Ukraine would become NATO members as well. Thus was set in motion events that
      eventually erupted into the Russia-Ukraine/NATO war in 2022—a defining event in
      the decline of the American empire which may represent the most recent, second
      phase of decline.  In parallel, however, US-CIA-NGO ‘color’ revolutions and regime
      changes were being engineered, including the early attempt at such in the Ukraine.
      Another geopolitical event as marker for America’s imperial apogee was the Iraq
      war in 2003, a year just before the big NATO expansion.  The Iraq war represents
      what appears to be the USA’s last successful direct military action.  Neither
      China nor Russia were sufficiently strong enough to prevent the war. Russia was
      just emerging from its great depression of the 1990s decade and in a debilitated
      military condition except perhaps for its nuclear forces.  China was dependent
      on western capital, US in particular, needed to jump start its economy after a
      weak 1990s performance and to begin its role as the world’s major manufacturing
      exporter. The rest of the global South countries were still heavily dependent
      on the US dollar, IMF-World Bank, US corporate direct FDI, and soliciting US free
      trade deals. The NAFTA north American free trade agreement was expanded, a number
      of bilateral free trade deals between the US and countries were signed, and a
      proposed North-South America free trade agreement was proposed. The Federal Reserve
      and its chair at the time, Alan Greenspan, seemed to be able to magically manage
      the economy. The news media referred to him as the ‘Maestro’ of the Fed. Domestically,
      profits were accelerating and wage levels rising in the wake of the late 1990s
      tech boom. Jobs were plentiful at mid-decade. GDP economic growth was slightly
      above long run historic averages, except for the 2001 recession—the first in ten
      years—which proved relatively shallow and short lived in 2001. The Housing market
      was booming. In terms of technology, the internet and wireless access was penetrating
      an ever greater percent of the US population. The country appeared unified as
      never since decades before, in the wake of the 9-11 terrorist attacks. However,
      beneath the surface major forces were developing that would result in major economic,
      foreign policy and domestic US political eruptions at the decade’s close and beyond.
      Economically, the Greenspan and Fed policy of flood the economy with virtually
      free money since 1986 continued into the 21 st century. That helped fuel the tech
      boom of the late 1990s which overheated by 2001 and bust. Financial deregulation
      policies of the late 1990s and during the 2000s were laying an economic time bomb
      that would explode by decade’s end. Greenspan cut a deal with then President George
      Bush to be reappointed chair of the Fed in exchange for continuing to flood the
      economy with money and keep interest rates artificially low as the Iraq war was
      launched and Bush’s 2004 election approached.  Fed monetary policy was artificially
      extending the business cycle into the new decade, overheating the housing market
      and, together with derivatives financial instruments and financial deregulation,
      creating the foundation for an historic financial crash later in the decade. Fed
      monetary policy was providing the fuel for financing US corporate offshore expansion
      and financial speculation that together were driving what was called ‘globalization’
      and ‘financialization’ at the time. The fundamentals for fiscal policy crises
      were also originating in the 2000s: In the wake of the 9-11 attacks, war and defense
      spending accelerated sharply throughout the decade. This coincided with the other
      side of the coin of fiscal instability—the start of the massive tax cutting in
      the midst of rising war spending. In 2001-04 taxes were cut $3.8 trillion for
      the 2001-10 decade, 80% of which accrued to corporations and wealthiest households. 
      Not surprisingly, the first decade of the century witnessed the beginning of what
      would prove a long term chronic escalation of budget deficits and the US national
      debt.  The national debt rose from $5.6 trillion in 2000 to almost double and
      $10 trillion by 2008. In other words, the new fiscal policies of escalating war
      and defense spending amidst massive tax cutting began blowing a hole in the government
      budgets and creating ever growing budget deficits and in turn the national debt. 
      In parallel, monetary policy of artificially low interest rates (at least until
      late 2006) put government bond sales in the service of subsidizing corporate offshoring
      and financial markets. This dual fiscal-monetary policy mix would erupt later
      into growing contradictions and crises in both fiscal and monetary policies in
      subsequent decades. But the pattern was set in the 2000s. What these policies
      represent at another level is a general retreat by US elites from historic strategies
      for financing war and Empire. In the 21 st century for the first time in US economic
      history the US elite began funding its wars and empire not by taxation or by bond
      financing of its citizenry, as it had in its imperial expansion throughout the
      20 th century. Now in the 21 st war financing was largely out of direct legislation
      appropriations by Congress.  In fact, as its ‘wars on terrorism’ erupted in 2001-03
      and continued another 20 years, as it expanded its military bases worldwide after
      2001, expanded its surface naval, missile, aircraft and submarine forces and Pentagon
      weapons spending in general, expanded the CIA, special forces, NGO funding, and
      began funding proxy wars—the US elites have notably done so while simultaneously
      massively cutting taxes instead of raising them! The seeds of crisis in ‘external’
      policy (trade, capital flows, currency) were also sown in the first decade period. 
      Free trade deals were expanding, thus encouraging more offshoring by corporations
      and in turn demand by those corporations for low Fed interest rates with which
      to finance the offshore expansion. The US trade deficit consequently worsened
      in parallel with the budget deficit, as the trade deficit meant a rising net outflow
      of US dollars from the US economy to globally elsewhere.  The ‘external’ problem
      would grow unstable in later years, but for now the excess dollar outflow was
      recycled back to the US economy in the form of foreign purchases of US Treasury
      bonds and securities. Heavy buyers of Treasuries were Japan, Europe and the new
      trading partner China.  For now the trade deficit was enabling the financing of
      the rising budget deficit, which in turn was growing as a result of escalating
      war and defense spending amidst historic tax cutting. A triad of fiscal-monetary
      and trade/dollar recycling policies were still mutually supporting each other
      in the first decade. However, should any one of the three fail to perform in the
      future—as they would—the consequence would prove to be growing instability in
      both the real and financial sectors of the US economy. Problems and instability
      with the political system were intensifying as well during that seminal first
      decade. At the start of the decade the key marker of beginning political decline
      was the intercession of the US Supreme Court to decide who was the winner in the
      contested election of 2000 between George W. Bush and Al Gore. Problems with ballot
      counting in the state of Florida led not to a recounting of the ballots, as required
      by election laws but instead resulted in the Supreme Court intervening—with no
      Constitutional precedent—to stop the recounting and give the election to Bush.
      That decision set in motion a string of further decisions by the court, and other
      government institutions, limiting voters rights in elections. It was accompanied
      in 2001-02 with the passage of the infamous Patriot Act that authorized deep spying
      and surveillance of American citizens and thus a severe restricting of US Constitution
      1 st amendment and 4 th amendment civil liberties and rights. Campaign finance
      reform efforts also died during the first decade, crowned by the Supreme Court
      decade’s end Citizens United decision ruling that corporations were persons with
      the same free speech rights as citizens and  they exercised free speech by contributing
      money in elections to their favored candidates. Between these ‘anti-democracy’
      book ends of the decade were various court decisions ‘gerrymandering’ Congress
      so that both parties, Democrats and Republicans, locked themselves into near majorities
      despite elections. A separate chapter of the book will address the various dimensions
      of democracy decline after 2000 as a reflection of growing decline of Empire.
      US social-cultural decline emerging in parallel with the apogee of America’s imperial
      hegemony also began circa the mid-first decade. To cite just a few indicators:
      US deaths by drug overdose rose from 17,000 in 2000 to 36,000 by 2007. Suicides
      rose from 33,000 to 38,000, 60% of which were by guns. Homicides by guns totaling
      more than 10,000 that latter year as well. By 2023 drug overdose, suicides and
      homicides would rise to 87,000, 49,000 and 19,000 respectively. Socio-cultural
      decline has many indicators, addressed in more detail in later chapters in the
      book. This will include an important, albeit difficult to quantify, impact of
      social media on country’s general mental health, especially of youth, and its
      consequences for undermining of the political system itself.  The 2000s marked
      the beginning of important changes in technology impacting both mental health
      and political instability: In 2003 social media giants like Facebook appeared—and
      their negative impact on society and democracy accelerated  after the introduction
      of Apple’s Iphone in 2007. Thus in summary, History will likely show—and this
      book will argue and attempt to explain—the American empire reached a peak in terms
      of global economic hegemony and an apex in geopolitical and military power around
      the middle of the first decade of the current century.  Subsequent to 2005-07,
      the Empire in all its key dimensions—economic, political, social, technological,
      and even cultural—has been in decline. Moreover, that rate of decline has not
      been stable or linear but has accelerated after certain crisis events which include
      the 2008-09 economic crash, the Covid crisis of 2020 and, most recently, the imminent
      loss of the US/NATO proxy war in Ukraine. The Increasingly Unaffordable Empire
      The creation and maintenance of empire is an expensive undertaking. At the foundation
      of all is their economic base. The costs of pursuing and/or defending empire are
      significant. The home country must produce or otherwise acquire significant economic
      resources with which to finance empire.  This has been true not only in the modern
      era of empires in the last five hundred years or so during capitalist economy,
      but even before that. Empires rise over the course of decades or even centuries.
      And they weaken and decline over extended periods of time. An appearance of collapse
      is just the final act. Empires never collapse due to lost wars but due to internal
      forces. Lost wars are more a symptom and reflection of those internal forces driving
      decline, than a cause of them. That has been true from the Roman Empire to the
      more recent British. All empires lose wars along the way as they expand, as well
      as from time to time during their period of subsequent sustained ascendance. The
      Roman lost many wars along the trajectory of its expansion as well as during its
      centuries-long period of sustained ascendance. Rome’s expansion was financed initially
      by plunder or its opponents’ wealth, including its ‘investments’ in human capital
      in the form of mass slavery. Its occupation of foreign lands then added to wealth
      and surplus extraction in the form of taxing of agricultural production, in particular
      grains. Its decline began when it stopped expanding by conquest and acquisition
      of plunder and slaves and then subsequently also lost the grain agricultural production
      regions that produced the economic surplus with which it financed its armies—first
      in Egypt when the empire split into east and west in the fourth century and then
      in North Africa, Sicily and Spain after Germanic invasions in the 5 th cut off
      the surplus. Rome’s armies atrophied and with it its ability to defend its former
      acquisitions. Fast forward to the 19 th century British empire. It too expanded
      by means of acquisition of surplus wealth from the countries it conquered. The
      surplus upon which its empire depended and expanded was not primarily slavery
      or agricultural. The British extracted wealth from its colonies by means of natural
      resource plunder and cheap production of goods by the native population (wage
      slavery as some might call it).  Its colonial administrations organized local
      mining and goods production, as well as agricultural production, and subsequently
      shipped the goods back to Britain for resale at profit in the home country and
      for trade to other countries. Thus trade and the market were the sources of surplus
      wealth extraction with which it financed its Navy and armies to further expand
      and defend its acquisitions and empire in general. This system of empire worked
      well into the 20 th century, even as it broke down elsewhere at times in its imperial
      advance. One such example of was the empire’s loss of the war with its North American
      colonies in the late 18 th century. Until the 1780s its ‘American colonies’ functioned
      to extract wealth by means of agricultural and resource production by colonists
      as well as trade with native American tribes for furs. Britain controlled the
      banking and shipping of all goods to and from north America. The colonists were
      not allowed to develop their own banking system, own currency, or even their own
      shipping. They could not trade with any other countries (especially Caribbean
      or French goods) but only with Britain which controlled and set the terms of trade.
      This monopoly control by London was the source of much of the colonists’ original
      revolt. It was surplus extraction by means of the monopolization of trade and
      the dominance of market control. The decline of the British empire began in earnest
      when it could no longer control the terms of trade with its former colonies and
      extract sufficient surplus in order to finance a military force necessary to fight
      a world war. The costs of empire in the 20 th century exceeded its extraction
      of surplus needed to fund that empire. It ended up borrowing from the rising American
      empire in the 1920s and after 1945 it was essentially broke financially. It effectively
      auctioned off its control of key resources in the middle east and elsewhere to
      America during and after the second world war and then had to abandon India and
      its other colonies after 1945 as well. As inheritor of the British empire, the
      trajectory of the American in the latter 20 th century has been similar but in
      key ways different as well. Surplus extraction has been by trade but also by dominance
      of money capital flows—i.e. finance. Financial imperialism has played a greater
      role than in the former, mostly industrial British empire. After America quickly
      assumed the role of global hegemon after World War II, and solidified that role
      by fundamentally restructuring its economy and political system between 1944-53,
      the American empire ruled more or less unchallenged over the vast majority of
      the globe for the remainder of the 20 th century. Funds for financial imperial
      expansion were plentiful, both from high rates of economic growth, a solid tax
      revenue base, trade surplus that brought wealth into the USA from around the world
      dependent at the time on US exports, as well as from financial exploitation.  New
      institutions of empire were created, like the IMF, World Bank, SWIFT payments
      system, etc. that did not exist similarly under the British empire.  The comparison
      of empires is based, however, not just on institutional differences but on the
      practices of how imperialism is employed. Chapter three of the book considers
      the new institutions of the American empire and how well they functioned in maintaining
      empire—and then increasingly didn’t or did less so over time. American imperialism
      was more efficient than the British in extracting wealth from its areas of dependency
      and control. Competition to the extent it existed was largely marginalized in
      the 1980s. There were no economic challengers to USA hegemony thereafter for a
      quarter century.  Europe and Japan were rendered deeply dependent on the US both
      economically and politically after the 1980s. The Soviet Union remained economically
      isolated within the USSR and east Europe and walled off from the rest of the global
      economy and then imploded by the end of the decade. China was even more isolated
      and economically backward throughout that period and well into the 1990s. The
      US imperial system entered an economic crisis in the 1970s decade but that was
      contained and subsequently overcome.  Challenged both at home by labor, social
      movements and growing popular resistance in the early 1970s—as well as from abroad
      economically by the expanding economies of Japan and Europe and by inroads on
      its periphery by the USSR—the American empire experienced its first real postwar
      crisis in the 1970s as the US economy was wracked by the worst inflation and recession
      since the 1930s, business investment collapsed, the breakdown of the gold-dollar
      standard created in 1944, and Japan and Europe began challenging its dominance
      in world trade during the decade. Its loss in Viet Nam in 1974 did not lead to
      the empire’s collapse, however; nor did the loss in Vietnam even mark the beginning
      of imperial decline. Losses of particular wars are not indicators of imperial
      decline necessarily.  After the end of the Vietnam conflict in 1974 the empire
      went on to expand even further in the 1980s for another quarter century, as it
      underwent a second major economic and political—that is neoliberal—restructuring
      over the next quarter century 1980-2005. US global hegemony thus was restored
      after the 1970s crisis by the restructuring of the economy and the political system
      during the neoliberal era, 1980-2005. Both US domestic and global political and
      economic relations were successfully rearranged. Neoliberal policies thereafter
      unleashed a major historic wave of US capital expansion abroad assisted by the
      financializing of the global economy with the US as dominant force. A geopolitical
      expansion starting in the 1990s accompanied the economic set in motion in the
      1980s. In summary : the loss of war in Vietnam amidst the general weakening of
      the US imperial system in the 1970s did not usher in a collapse of empire. Neither
      did the significant domestic US political instability and economic stagnation
      of the decade. Nor the challenges from capitalist and non-capitalist competitors
      globally. The empire was restructured and restored. That ‘Neoliberal’ restoration
      of Empire began to fracture and break down in the 21 st century, however as it
      reached its ‘apogee’ as discussed previously. As in the case of prior Empires,
      the American’s ability to finance the growing costs of Empire in the 21 st century—based
      on an economy increasingly unable to generate a surplus sufficient to fund those
      rising costs (for a host of reasons addressed in the book)—ushered in an extended
      period in the 21 st century of growing contradictions within and challenges from
      without to America’s imperial hegemony. This included contradictions within the
      policies that enabled surplus wealth extraction, contradictions within the policies
      that produced wealth within the economy, as well as contradictions between the
      economy and the empire’s political institutions. Phase One Decline: The Long 2008-2020
      Decade In the book the idea of contradictions is central to the analysis of the
      decline of the American empire in the 21 st century following its 2005-07 peak.
      Contradictions in this case defined as the functioning of one set of policies,
      institutions or practices causing the decline in the effectiveness of other policies,
      institutions or practices; or the effort to prevent the decline in the effectiveness
      of one set of policies, institutions or practices exacerbating the effectiveness
      of another set; or how decline in either set results in a feedback effect causing
      the other to become even less effective. As another chapter will argue as a case,
      efforts to resolve contradictions within fiscal policies (taxes, spending, deficits,
      etc.) result in an intensification of contradictions within monetary policies(interest
      rates and investment)—and vice versa.  Or how growing problems in external policies
      (trade, money flows, currency stability) in turn exacerbate fiscal policy contradictions.
      Or how geopolitical change and challenge to empire exacerbate external economic
      policies. Decline in empire begins when the economic base contradictions multiply
      to the point that attempts at resolving one results in deterioration of others.
       Crisis occurs when the contradictions multiply to the point that the Empire cannot
      be maintained without a major restructuring in economic and political relations,
      domestic and foreign. An example is the fiscal and monetary contradictions of
      Empire that began to grow throughout the first decade of the 21 st century thereafter
      erupting toward the close in the general crisis of 2008 that came to be known
      as the financial crash and great recession. In the wake of the September 11, 2001
      attacks on the USA, the direct and indirect costs of  empire began to accelerate. 
      The war on terrorism, as it was called, resulted in significant rise in defense
      and war spending. That was shortly thereafter in 2003 escalated by the unrelated
      war on Iraq and subsequent continued war with forces of resistance in Iraq and
      Afghanistan. The US elite declared war unofficially on what it called the ‘axis
      of evil’, which meant targeting Libya, Syria and North Korea as well as its long
      term opponent, Iran.  The Empire would eventually spend $9 trillion on its various
      wars in the middle east alone—not counting a surge in strategic weapons buildup
      for aircraft carriers, nuclear submarines, satellites, new versions of tanks,
      planes and other combat equipment and general Pentagon salary escalation. Simultaneous
      with this defense-based fiscal spending, US elites decided the Empire could embark
      on massive tax cutting for mostly business interests. In the first decade $3.8
      trillion in tax cuts were enacted by 2004, followed by at least another $180 billion
      in 2008 and $300 billion in 2009 as the great recession occurred those last years
      of the decade.  Another $4 trillion in monetary injections by the US central bank,
      the Federal Reserve, accompanied the roughly $850 billion of the Obama administration’s
      fiscal stimulus of 2009-10. Weak economic recovery after 2009 would result in
      another $800 billion in tax cuts for 2010-12 followed by a further additional
      $5 trillion starting in 2013.  Weak real economic growth from 2010 to 2015 further
      reduced tax revenues, as Pentagon and defense spending continued at excessive
      levels addressing continued warfare in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and elsewhere.
      The consequence of the progressive surge in war and defense spending from 2001
      on—amidst the massive tax cutting underway in parallel, was a record surge in
      US annual budget deficits and rise in the national debt during the first decade.
      That plus the cost of social bailouts from the 2008-10 crash amounted to a rise
      in the national debt from $5.6 trillion in 2000 to $10 trillion in 2008. Subsequent
      tax cutting in 2009-10, slow economic recovery from the great recession crash,
      $5 trillion in further tax cuts 2013-23 and continued war/defense spending resulted
      in rising annual budget deficits and $19.5 trillion national debt by 2016. The
      Covid economic crash added another $3.1 trillion in bailouts in 2020 as tax revenues
      collapsed due to the Covid shutdown of much of the US economy. The deficit in
      2020 alone was more than $3 trillion and the national debt went to $27 trillion
      by the end of that year. Meanwhile monetary policy in the form of the US central
      bank, the Federal Reserve, was developing its own set of internal contradictions
      as well.  Instead of introducing a policy of selling government bonds to finance
      the war and defense spending surge, the central bank policy focused on injecting
      money into the economy to keep interest rates near zero. That fueled financial
      market speculation and instability. Policies of financial deregulation since 1999
      and the excess speculation led eventually to the financial crash of 2007-09. That
      exacerbated the fiscal crisis by reducing tax revenues and increasing bailout
      costs. Monetary policy contradictions were exacerbating fiscal policy contradictions,
      in other words. The feedback effect between fiscal and monetary policy also intensified. 
      To cover the rising budget deficits, the Fed sold more Treasuries. More money
      injected into the economy led in turn to more financial asset market speculation
      instead of real investment, as result of the growing financialization of the US
      and Empire economy since the 1980s and especially after deregulation of finance
      after 1999. Contradictions in fiscal and monetary policies were feeding off each
      other. Simultaneously both were becoming increasingly ineffective in stimulating
      real economic growth, as evidenced by the chronic slow recovery of the real economy
      (at roughly 2/3s normal growth) throughout the second decade of the 21 st century
      even before the Covid crash of 2020-21. In separate chapters the book will address
      the contradictions in both fiscal and monetary policy in more detail, and the
      role both play in the growing inability of the Empire to fund its rising costs
      since 2001. Also considered in subsequent chapters how both fiscal and monetary
      contradictions are interacting negatively with contradictions in external policy
      as well (trade, money flows, the US dollar as global currency, etc.) that have
      been intensifying over the past decade. What this brief preceding and partial
      overview of contradictions represents is that the US elite in 2001 embarked upon
      a set of policies to fund rising commitments and costs of maintaining the American
      empire that have thus far proved a dismal failure.  The rising costs of defense
      amidst historic tax cutting and required social bailouts in 2008 and 2020 have
      resulted only in escalating annual budget deficits and accelerating national debt.
      Subsequent to the $3.1 trillion cost of bailout in 2020, another $3.7 trillion
      was introduced in fiscal stimulus. Plus another $4 trillion in monetary stimulus
      by the Federal Reserve. Since 2020 that amounts to a total fiscal-monetary stimulus
      of more than $10 trillion. The response of the real economy in terms of growth
      has been even more anemic than during the recovery from the 2008-09 crash when
      $1 trillion fiscal and $4 trillion Fed stimulus produced a below average GDP growth
      until 2016. Since the $3.6 trillion fiscal and second $4 trillion Fed monetary
      stimulus in 2020-21, the US economy has grown barely equal to its long term historic
      average of 2-2.5% GDP. That’s worth repeating: $10 trillion stimulus produced
      barely 2% growth in the subsequent three years 2022-24! Meanwhile, since 2020
      the costs of Empire have continued to accelerate—as the US empire engaged in a
      costly and winless war in Ukraine, continued funding European NATO economies,
      addressed wars in Israel and Yemen, and prepared militarily for eventual conflict
      with China in the Pacific.  In short, the Empire’s home economy is increasingly
      incapable of producing the surplus necessary to fund the rising costs of Empire.
       It continues to allow deficits and debt to accelerate, now by  2024-25 at levels
      of nearly $2 trillion annually and $36 trillion, respectively. As a result of
      Fed interest rate hikes since 2022, the interest on the $36 trillion national
      debt in 2024 has exceeded $1 trillion for 2024 and rising. According to the research
      arm of Congress, the Congressional Budget Office, the national debt by 2024 will
      amount to $56 trillion and interest payments to $1.7 trillion annually. The Empire
      can no longer afford to continue the $17 trillion in tax cuts it has implemented
      since 2001 and the $9 trillion it has spent on foreign wars—while paying more
      than $1 trillion a year to holders of US Treasuries, $1.3 trillion annually for
      Defense, and prepare for another financial-economic crash and recession bailout
      should it inevitably occur! Like the Roman and British empires before, the American
      empire is facing a crisis in the continued funding of its Empire.  Contradictions
      in policy and their growing ineffectiveness are no longer able to generate the
      necessary domestic economic growth and surplus from which to finance the growing
      costs of empire. It no longer has the economic base to fund three wars—in Europe
      (which includes the costs of NATO and Ukraine war), in the middle east (funding
      Israel, US naval assets in war with Yemen, preparing for possible war with Iran),
      and in Asia (prepare for conflict with China over Taiwan or South China sea).
      The American Empire can no longer afford to maintain 800 bases worldwide, retain
      a top heavy senior officer military (45 four star generals & below), pay for a
      bloated CIA-NGO regime change apparatus and government war bureaucracy, and develop
      next generation weapons in areas it is behind like hypersonic missiles, drones,
      air defense, nextgen naval assets and other ‘blackbox’ secret projects. And it
      cannot do this while it maintains and expands tax cuts, pays bondholders $1 trillion
      a year, and if it experiences another great financial and economic crisis that
      appears to occur every decade now. And especially it cannot if the US economy
      continues to grow at barely 2% per year. Or if the emerging challenge by the BRICS
      and global south result in a decline in the role of the lynchpin institution of
      the US global empire, the US dollar, as the dominant global trading and reserve
      currency. Trump 2.0 and the 4 th Restructuring The US mainstream media which is
      largely aligned with the Democrat party and those interests called, for lack of
      a better term, ‘globalists’, continue to aggressively push the message that Trump’s
      policies introduced in 2025 are chaotic, misdirected, reckless and doomed to failure
      at a cost of economic crisis and collapse of the former USA ‘rules based order’
      which characterized policies in the Neoliberal era up to and through the recent
      Biden administration. In the analysis of this book in its concluding chapters,
      Trump 2.0 policies and programs are best described, however, as a stumbling toward
      a new restructuring—a new set policies and a new re-arranging of US and global
      economic and political relations.  Within that restructuring lies a shift to new
      sources and methods with which to fund the American Empire. A major thrust of
      Trump policies is to shift defense and foreign spending from areas of little return
      for the cost and from areas no longer strategic for US imperial interests. Europe
      and NATO are no longer considered as strategic enough to justify the level of
      current NATO spending, which includes the US proxy war in Ukraine. Nor is the
      billions spent on agencies like USAID, national endowment for Democracy, and other
      NGO funding.  A review of excess and unnecessary expenditure in the Departments
      of Defense, State and CIA is also underway.  Bloated staffing accumulated over
      the past forty years of expanding Empire commitments is also under review. The
      USA had four 4-Star generals at the close of world war II; it reportedly now has
      forty-five and who knows how many three and two stars. Many will go into retirement.
      Other staffing will no doubt be cut as well. The DOGE initiatives should be viewed
      in the same light. Congress has identified a potential 1.7 million cut in federal
      employment. Likely at least 1 million will occur. Most will occur via quits, probationary
      (< 2 yr service) employees, and those in federal government support for Education—the
      costs and employment of which will be turned over to the states to manage. Trump
      tariff policies should be viewed in light of this general federal government cost
      cutting. The primary function of Trump tariff policy is to raise revenues, while
      using the threat of tariffs to extract political concessions from governments
      in areas like immigration and so on. Long term tariffs are designed, in Trump
      policy, to incent US and foreign corporations to relocate to the US economy and
      invest more in the US.  Tariff policy too is designed to raise funds for new defense
      area spending in tandem with foreign policy savings from reducing unnecessary
      empire spending cuts. The American Empire is in the process of consolidating to
      focus more on the western hemisphere and the Pacific, rearranging strategic priorities,
      preparing to engage the BRICS, China and Russia economically and otherwise, and
      securing sources of funding for next generation military and defense technologies
      and weaponry in areas in which it is currently behind China and Russia.  That
      is what the withdrawal from Ukraine, NATO, the tariffs and other apparent shifts
      are about. Whether Trump succeeds in this restructuring remains to be seen. Trump
      2.0 is for certain a restructuring of external relations—economic, military and
      political. It may amount to a more general restructuring of the US economy and
      domestic political relations as well. Whether the changes will result in an abandonment
      of the Neoliberal policy mix introduced by the Reagan administration in 1980 and
      its replacement with something fundamentally different also depends on changes
      yet to unfold. To summarize on this concluding point: the American empire as structured
      today, at the end of the first quarter of the 21 st century, is increasingly unaffordable! 
      Changes in the US and global economy over the course of the neoliberal policy
      regime (1980-2025) has, in addition, made the US economy financially ‘fragile’
      and potentially unstable, while simultaneously slowing its ability to grow in
      real terms at a reasonable rate required to fund the growing costs of Empire as
      recently structured.   While neoliberal policies enabled the expansion of empire
      for a quarter century, those same policies—fiscal, monetary, industrial and external
      (trade, currency, capital flows)—have developed contradictions that can no longer
      simultaneously enable the funding or maintaining of the rising costs of Empire.
      Nor can they continue to function to stabilize effectively the US domestic economy
      or its economic relations globally. Trump 2.0 policies should be viewed in this
      context, as its administration stumbles toward trying to confront the reality
      of an Empire in decline and to reorder it in order to ensure its continued existence.
      The following is an initial summary of chapter content of the book, Twilight of
      American Imperialism. Chapter Content Chapter One includes a review of some of
      the key literature on Imperialism.  How have non-Marxist (bourgeois) economists
      (Schumpeter, Weber, Hobson, Fielding, Hardt) explained Imperialism? How have classic
      Marxist economists (Marx, Lenin, Hilferding, Luxemburg) explained it? How about
      more contemporary writers (Sweezy, Harvey, Hudson, Foster, Smith, Wallerstein)?
      What have they missed in understanding the nature of Imperialism in general, and
      American Imperialism in particular? Apart from the theorists, what was pre-capitalist
      era imperialism like? What were its key elements: conquest & plunder, land grabbing,
      resource theft, colonial managed exploitation, primitive, slave based, non-slave
      forced labor, merchant trade? How has capitalist era Imperialism differed from
      pre-capitalist? How has it evolved and changed over time, from capitalist colonialism,
      post-colonial industrial, unequal trade Imperialism, financial imperialism? A
      working definition of Imperialism across its genus and various species is offered
      as a basis for analysis and comparison. Chapter Two discusses the evolution of
      American imperialism itself— from its early traditional land-grabbing expansion
      across the North American continent from 1768 to 1890, its initial offshore colonialization
      in 1898-1902 that followed, its emergence on the global scale in the wake of World
      War I alongside British Imperialism, followed by its global ascendance and consolidation
      after 1944 largely displacing European and Japanese imperialisms. Described as
      well is how the Empire dealt with the challenges to Empire in the 1970s decade,
      thereafter restored American global hegemony in the 1980s with Neoliberal policies,
      ruled unchallenged and expanded after the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, reaching
      its apex in the first decade of the 21 st century. In Chapter Three the key institutions
      of American economic and political imperialism in its era of ascendance post-World
      War II are identified, from those initially created at Bretton Woods in 1944 to
      the institutional forms that appeared in response to the crisis of Empire in the
      decade of the 1970s, and the further institutions that arose in the 21 st century.
      Chapter Four provides a detailed review of the chronic mal-performance of the
      US economy in the 21 st century. While American global hegemony reached its apex
      in the first decade of the 21 st century, underlying contradictions in the Empire’s
      economic base were maturing in parallel since the 1980s. How those contradictions—rooted
      in the material triad of globalization, financialization, and accelerating technological
      change—contributed to the chronic mal-performance of the US economy after 2000
      is the subject of the chapter. Chapters Five and Six then review the associated,
      growing contradictions to US monetary and fiscal policies which the US economy
      has historically relied upon to stabilize the US economy and thereby facilitate
      the Empire’s expansion after 1980. The chapters address how and why fiscal and
      monetary policies, respectively, entered a period of growing contradiction after
      the great financial crash and recession of 2008-09. Chapters Seven and Eight describe
      how US global economic and political hegemony has been fading since 2008-09, and
      especially since 2020-24. Discussed here are material forces and institutions
      such as the US dollar as global trade and reserve currency, the US managed SWIFT
      payments systems, the US global twin deficits dollar recycling system, free trade
      agreements and the World Bank as institutions promoting US foreign investment,
      America’s growing resort to trade wars and reliance on sanctions, the impact of
      new technologies on the balance of military power, the IMF and US Federal Reserve
      bank ensuring stable currencies in a post-gold world, US wars of empire and military
      strategy the past quarter century, declining US influence in global institutions
      like the WTO, United Nations, G20 as well as its ability to wield soft power influence
      in general. Chapters Nine and Ten turn to US Empire’s domestic conditions and
      a description of how domestic political and social conditions are also indicators
      of current American Imperial decline: These include splits in the ruling elite,
      decline and loss of legitimacy of democracy and internal political institutions,
      political party decadence, political corruption, fading influence of mainstream
      media, civil liberties’ crisis, etc. as considered as indicators of internal political
      decline are reviewed in chapter 9. To which are added a discussion of indicators
      of US social decline in chapter 10. Chapter Eleven visits the evolving ideology
      of Empire. A definition of Ideology is offered, followed by a discussion of the
      key ideas that have been serving to justify Empire—from ‘Human Rights’ and ‘American
      Exceptionialism’ of prior decades to the more contemporary ‘Axes of Evil’ and
      ‘Rules  Based International Order’. The final Chapter 12 summarizes the material
      forces behind the fading of US global hegemony and Empire in the 21 st century:
      How proliferating US wars in the 21 st century have contributed; the chronic long
      term slowing of the US real economy; the increasingly ineffective fiscal, monetary,
      and external US economic policies; US neocons’ disastrous dominance of US foreign
      policy, the US elites’ wanton dissipation of critical US resources; declining
      legitimacy of US domestic political institutions and democratic practices; the
      declining standard of living and quality of life in America; growing rejection
      of the Ideology of Empire by broad sectors of US society; the weakening global
      institutions and tools ($dollar, SWIFT, IMF, World Bank, WTO, G20, etc) of Empire;
      and the rise, expansion and successes of China-Russia-BRICS and general challenge
      to Empire by the global South. All the preceding forces have been converging and
      thereby contributing to the undermining and fading of American imperial hegemony.
      The final chapter concludes with an appraisal of Trump’s 2025 policies as an attempt
      to re-stabilize the American empire despite forces driving its decline. Ten Theses
      on Imperialism Throughout the 12 chapters of the book major themes about Imperialism
      in general—and American Imperialism in particular—are raised and discussed. In
      brief, these include: 1. Imperialism is fundamentally about extracting the wealth
      of a country, region or nation group by another—the methods and means of which
      may vary as well as evolve over time; 2. Imperialisms evolve in both form and
      content, and in parallel with the evolution of the dominant economic system and
      that system’s materialist base; 3. All Imperialisms rest on a particular material
      and institutional structure and may expand and weaken, revive, weaken again, expand
      again, etc. before a conclusive decline and end; 4. American Imperialism has evolved
      in stages from the mid-18 th century to the early 21 st century—from early land-grabbing
      settler, slave form, offshore colonial, and industrial-unequal exchange trade
      forms to its current highly financialized and technology-dependent form; 5. American
      Imperialism peaked Economically, Politically and Militarily in the first decade
      of the 21 st century; 6. Contradictions within American Imperialism have been
      growing since the 1980s, deepened after its 2007 apogee with the 2008-09 financial
      and real economic crash, and have accelerated in decline in the current 2020-25
      period; 7. In the latest phase of its decline, 2022-25, the American Empire has
      begun a process of contraction, consolidating its core Economic-Political-Military
      allies (G7/8) while simultaneously responding more aggressively (economically
      and militarily) to its challengers; 8. The American Empire’s Technology Advantage
      Gap, that in former decades ensured American military hegemony, has eroded sharply
      in the last decade and will continue to narrow; 9. The Rise and expansion of the
      BRICS and allied global South presents an existential challenge and threat to
      American global hegemony and Imperialism; 10. Trump policies beginning 2025 represent
      an attempt to restructure US global economic relations, shift strategic priorities
      and restore funding necessary for stabilizing the decline of Empire. Dr. Jack

  - title: Trump’s Ukraine Minerals Deal 2.0 Capitulation
    url: https://jackrasmus.com/2025/05/09/trumps-ukraine-minerals-deal-2-0-capitulation-2/
    text: 'Last week the Trump administration and Ukraine finally signed a deal on sharing
      Ukraine mineral rights. But a closer consideration of the published document shows
      this Mineral Deal 2.0 is fundamentally different from the 1.0 deal Trump proposed
      in February. One might more accurately call it a Trump capitulation. In March
      Trump’s initial 1.0 deal was supposed to be signed in the White House with Ukraine’s
      president Zelensky. That meeting notoriously blew up with all the world watching
      in ascerbic verbal exchanges between Zelensky, Vice President JD Vance and Trump.
      Zelensky then left the meeting and immediately departed the US, flying directly
      to a meeting with British Prime Minister, Keir Starmer, who greeted him publicly
      with open arms and hugs. In the White House meeting all sides were scheduled to
      announce the deal. But upon arrival Zelensky informed Trump he couldn’t agree.
      So the parties were in an agitated mood even before the meeting. Zelensky made
      a nasty comment in Ukrainian to Vance and it went downhill from there. The essence
      of the March ‘Minerals Deal 1.0’s called for Ukraine to agree to using revenues
      from the exploitation its minerals would to repay the US for past military and
      economic aid to Ukraine. Trump estimated that amount at $350 billion. Other sources
      estimate around $100 billion. The actual amount no doubt somewhere in between.
      In any case no small amount of financial assistance. Zelensky has always argued
      any such deal must be accompanied by a formal US security agreement with Ukraine.
      That was a precondition from the very beginning last October 2024 when Zelensky
      himself proposed a minerals sharing deal. However, the US has never linked a security
      agreement to the deal. The lack of a security clause in the agreement lay behind
      Zelensky’s reneging on the deal at the last moment when he arrived in the US for
      the White House meeting. The Minerals Deal 2.0 signed last week shares little
      with Trump’s prior 1.0 offer. The 2.0, for example, explicitly excludes any use
      of the revenues from joint minerals exploitation to repay the US for back aid
      given Ukraine with no strings attached by the Biden administration. This fact
      of no repayment for prior aid renders the 2.0 deal fundamentally different from
      Trump’s original proposal. And there’s more that differentiates the two deals.
      Last week’s signed 2.0 deal creates an Investment Fund into which revenues from
      the exploitation of Ukraine minerals would be deposited. The Investment Fund also
      provides for the US and Ukraine to bear costs of minerals extraction 50-50. However,
      while costs are shared 50-50 it says nothing about revenue sharing 50-50. In fact,
      reportedly the 2.0 deal is silent about how revenues will be shared, or if at
      all. What the Investment Fund document does say about revenues is that all proceeds
      from the development and exploitation of Ukraine’s minerals will be deposited
      back into the Investment Fund in toto for the first ten years after the Fund is
      created. So all the revenues goes back into Ukraine; no revenues return to the
      US for repayment or, indeed, apparently for any reason. One has to ask why has
      Trump completely capitulated, dropping his prior main demand for revenues compensating
      the US for back aid? The language of the Investment Fund further allows either
      party, US or Ukraine, to deposit additional monies, apart from the revenues from
      the development of the minerals, into the Fund. Moreover—and here’s a most interesting
      provision—Ukraine has interpreted this additional contribution to the Fund to
      mean the US may contribute to the fund in the form of more weapons shipments to
      Ukraine. In other words, the value of the weapons would go to the US share of
      the 50-50 cost commitment. In addition, the US media has reported the 2.0 Deal
      includes the right of Ukraine to use its share of the Fund revenues to purchase
      US weapons. In other words, this language suggests the Fund is intended to function
      as a back door to renewed US weapons shipments to Ukraine—thus reversing Trump’s
      past publicly declaration he would not agree to any more shipments of weapons
      to Ukraine. Not coincidentally, within days of the deal signing the US media has
      reported that the US has resumed issuing licenses for future weapons shipment
      to Ukraine. And that the US will provide supplies for the F-16 jets from Denmark
      given to Ukraine. Then there’s the recent revelation that the US has arranged
      for Israel and Germany to send Ukraine two US Patriot Missile systems? That does
      not include the missiles themselves. Only the US can provide that and likely will
      soon. Another curious feature is the Minerals 2.0 capitulation agreement is only
      one of the three documents involved in the agreement has been published. That’s
      the Investment Fund. So where are the other two? What do they say? And why are
      the media and politicians not demanding the other two ‘silent’ documents be published?
      Was perhaps more conceded by Trump that he does not want revealed? It’s curious
      that all these terms of the Minerals deal quickly fell in place after Trump’s
      meeting with Zelensky at the Vatican last week as both attended the funeral of
      Pope Francis . A convenient photo op was published and distributed around the
      world showing Trump and Zelensky sitting on chairs face to face in the Vatican.
      Thereafter, within 24 hours the Minerals deal is announced! Does anyone think
      this timing was mere coincidence? Or believe the media’s spin that Zelensky was
      able to button-hole Trump at the funeral at the last moment, get a meeting, and
      convince Trump to sign the Minerals deal with all the terms specifically benefiting
      Ukraine—i.e. no revenues repaying the US for past aid, cost sharing but no revenues
      sharing for any reason, a backdoor to future US weapons shipment, two of the three
      documents unpublished, and who knows what else? Is the Investment Fund really
      about financing future joint development of Ukraine minerals and Ukraine economy’s
      redevelopment? Or is it a vehicle for enabling Ukraine to buy more US weapons?
      In any event, Minerals Deal 2.0 has little resemblance to Trump’s original Minerals
      Deal 1.0. What it does resemble, however, is a major capitulation by Trump to
      Ukraine and Zelensky. The question is why the capitulation to Zelensky and Ukraine?
      There are several possible explanations floating around. Here’s a couple. First,
      some say it’s just another Trump big grift. That he’s creating a Fund he’ll somehow
      find a way to personally exploit. I don’t believe so. Those who suggest that must
      show how he intends to get at a Fund that appears locked up for ten years in Ukraine’s
      favor. Another explanation is that the real language governing the deal is contained
      in the two documents that haven’t been made public. The other two docs are more
      demanding of Ukraine and pro-US. But that’s pure conjecture. One would have to
      see what the other documents actually say and it’s not likely the contents will
      appear any time soon. Another is that the US neocons, Europeans, and Zelensky
      all ganged up on Trump in Rome at the funeral and, as appears so often in the
      case of Trump, got to him last and turned him around. That’s plausible. Trump
      is notorious for making decisions based on the latest advocates who get his ear.
      This writer believes, however, that the Minerals 2.0 deal is a way for Trump to
      show some progress on the question of Ukraine and the war. Trump and his team
      have dedicated no small effort to pushing his ‘Kellogg Plan’ as the basis for
      a ceasefire and for commencing negotiations between Ukraine and Russia. The Kellogg
      Plan collapsed just days before the signing of Minerals Deal 2.0. And there’s
      no indication it will ever be resurrected. That collapse has to have had some
      influence on Trump’s capitulating on the Minerals deal. The Kellogg Plan collapsed
      mostly because Zelensky refuses to talk until Russia unconditionally ceases fire,
      during which Zelensky retains the right to re-equip, re-store military personnel,
      and re-position military units as he pleases. Russia’s position is it will negotiate
      anytime and place but ceasefire is a subject of discussion after negotiations
      begin. Europe’s leadership agrees completely with the Zelensky position on the
      matter of ceasefire. Other positions of the two parties, Ukraine and Russia, put
      them even further apart as well: Zelensky demands Russia give up all territories
      occupied before negotiations; Russia declares the four regions and Crimea are
      now part of Russia and by its constitution cannot negotiate giving away any part
      of the country. In addition, Russia demands Ukraine demilitarize and declare it
      won’t join NATO; Zelensky rejects either notion as not a subject for negotiation.
      In other words, Trump’s Kellogg Plan was fundamentally naïve as a basis for any
      ceasefire or negotiations. It’s not surprising it collapsed. That Trump pushed
      it so long suggests he’s received bad advice or that the plan was always just
      a cover for other negotiations. The collapse of the Kellogg Plan made Trump appear
      as if he was now at a ‘dead end’ in his efforts to mediate the war and unable
      to deliver on his campaign promise to end the war in 24 hours by getting the parties
      together and, to borrow a phrase, ‘making both sides an offer they couldn’t refuse’.
      The plan collapse reveals the US no longer has the level of influence it once
      did at the height of its imperial power at the start of the 21 st century. The
      world has moved on. The US is relatively weaker; the rest of the world relatively
      stronger. Trump appeared weak with the collapse of the Kellogg Plan. The Minerals
      2.0 deal is therefore a substitute event, to enable Trump to show events are not
      at a standstill. He has not yet failed in his campaign promise. Not all is at
      fundamental impasse. Trump’s alternatives at this point is either to follow the
      advice of his neocon advisers and provide Ukraine with more weapons and threaten
      the Russians that more US actions are forthcoming if they don’t come to the negotiating
      table. But this is essentially the Biden plan which produced no results for the
      prior three years. It is also the US neocons’ position real Plan A. They may have
      gone along with the Kellogg Plan B knowing full well it would collapse. Trump’s
      other choice is to follow the advice of others like Witkoff and Vance in his administration
      to cut Ukraine loose and end all current US military assistance. Let events evolve
      on the ground for the next six months and intervene again later this year when
      one or both parties, Ukraine and/or Russia, are more amenable to a compromise.
      Trump now appears drifting in the direction of the neocons’ plan to resurrect
      Plan A somehow and away from the opposing view that the only choice is to cut
      losses and let the Europeans have their war in Ukraine if they want. As this article
      is written, reports are that Trump now wants a direct face to face meeting in
      May with Putin in Saudi Arabia. This suggests either he’s not too confident he’s
      directly getting the facts from his neocon advisers; or perhaps he thinks he can
      hammer out a deal over the table with Putin—as if he were concluding some kind
      of corporate acquisition where both sides ‘horse trade’ the main remaining unresolved
      issues on the table at the 11 th hour to seal a deal. If the latter, he’ll have
      some difficulty convincing the Russians he’s not just another western politician
      who makes promises, even signs documents, on which he then reneges—just as occurred
      in 2015 with the Minsk II agreement and again in Istanbul in 2022 when the war
      could have ended were it not for European NATO intervention convincing Zelensky
      to continue the conflict. by Dr. Jack Rasmus copyright 2025'

      commitment, which was never provided. Consequently, the new 2.0 deal lacks many
      of the elements of the original proposal, indicating a shift in negotiations and
      possibly a capitulation by Trump.

      The Investment Fund also provides for the US and Ukraine to bear costs of minerals

      to purchase US weapons. In other words, this language suggests the Fund is intended
      to function as a back door to renewed US weapons shipments to Ukraine—thus reversing
      Trump’s past publicly declaration he would not agree to any more shipments of
      weapons to Ukraine. Not coincidentally, within days of the deal signing the US
      media has reported that the US has  resumed issuing licenses for future weapons
      shipment to Ukraine. And that the US will provide supplies for the F-16 jets from
      Denmark given to Ukraine. Then there’s the recent revelation that the US has arranged
      for Israel and Germany to send Ukraine two US Patriot Missile systems? That does
      not include the missiles themselves. Only the US can provide that and likely will
      soon. Another curious feature is the Minerals 2.0 capitulation agreement is only
      one of the three documents involved in the agreement has been published. That’s
      the Investment Fund. So where are the other two? What do they say? And why are
      the media and politicians not demanding the other two ‘silent’ documents be published? 
      Was perhaps more conceded by Trump that he does not want revealed? It’s curious
      that all these terms of the Minerals deal quickly fell in place after Trump’s
      meeting with Zelensky at the Vatican last week as both attended the funeral of
      Pope Francis. A convenient photo op was published and distributed around the world
      showing Trump and Zelensky sitting on chairs face to face in the Vatican. Thereafter,
      within 24 hours the Minerals deal is announced! Does anyone think this timing
      was mere coincidence? Or believe the media’s spin that Zelensky was able to button-hole
      Trump at the funeral at the last moment, get a meeting, and convince Trump to
      sign the Minerals deal with all the terms specifically benefiting Ukraine—i.e.
      no revenues repaying the US for past aid, cost sharing but no revenues sharing
      for any reason, a backdoor to future US weapons shipment, two of the three documents
      unpublished, and who knows what else? Is the Investment Fund really about financing
      future joint development of Ukraine minerals and Ukraine economy’s redevelopment?
      Or is it a vehicle for enabling Ukraine to buy more US weapons? In any event,
      Minerals Deal 2.0 has little resemblance to Trump’s original Minerals Deal 1.0.
      What it does resemble, however, is a major capitulation by Trump to Ukraine and
      Zelensky. The question is why the capitulation to Zelensky and Ukraine? There
      are several possible explanations floating around. Here’s a couple. First, some
      say it’s just another Trump big grift. That he’s creating a Fund he’ll somehow
      find a way to personally exploit.  I don’t believe so. Those who suggest that
      must show how he intends to get at a Fund that appears locked up for ten years
      in Ukraine’s favor. Another explanation is that the real language governing the
      deal is contained in the two documents that haven’t been made public. The other
      two docs are more demanding of Ukraine and pro-US.  But that’s pure conjecture.
      One would have to see what the other documents actually say and it’s not likely
      the contents will appear any time soon. Another is that the US neocons, Europeans,
      and Zelensky all ganged up on Trump in Rome at the funeral and, as appears so
      often in the case of Trump, got to him last and turned him around. That’s plausible.
      Trump is notorious for making decisions based on the latest advocates who get
      his ear. This writer believes, however, that the Minerals 2.0 deal is a way for
      Trump to show some progress on the question of Ukraine and the war.  Trump and
      his team have dedicated no small  effort to pushing his ‘Kellogg Plan’ as the
      basis for a ceasefire and for commencing negotiations between Ukraine and Russia.
      The Kellogg Plan collapsed just days before the signing of Minerals Deal 2.0. 
      And there’s no indication it will ever be resurrected. That collapse has to have
      had some influence on Trump’s capitulating on the Minerals deal. The Kellogg Plan
      collapsed mostly because Zelensky refuses to talk until Russia unconditionally
      ceases fire, during which Zelensky retains the right to re-equip, re-store military
      personnel, and re-position military units as he pleases. Russia’s position is
      it will negotiate anytime and place but ceasefire is a subject of discussion after
      negotiations begin. Europe’s leadership agrees completely with the Zelensky position
      on the matter of ceasefire. Other positions of the two parties, Ukraine and Russia,
      put them even further apart as well: Zelensky demands Russia give up all territories
      occupied before negotiations; Russia declares the four regions and Crimea are
      now part of Russia and by its constitution cannot negotiate giving away any part
      of the country. In addition, Russia demands Ukraine demilitarize and declare it
      won’t join NATO; Zelensky rejects either notion as not a subject for negotiation.
      In other words, Trump’s Kellogg Plan was fundamentally naïve as a basis for any
      ceasefire or negotiations. It’s not surprising it collapsed. That Trump pushed
      it so long suggests he’s received bad advice or that the plan was always just
      a cover for other negotiations. The collapse of the Kellogg Plan made Trump appear
      as if he was now at a ‘dead end’ in his efforts to mediate the war and unable
      to deliver on his campaign promise to end the war in 24 hours by getting the parties
      together and, to borrow a phrase, ‘making both sides an offer they couldn’t refuse’. 
      The plan collapse reveals the US no longer has the level of influence it once
      did at the height of its imperial power at the start of the 21 st century. The
      world has moved on. The US is relatively weaker; the rest of the world relatively
      stronger.  Trump appeared weak with the collapse of the Kellogg Plan. The Minerals
      2.0 deal is therefore a substitute event, to enable Trump to show events are not
      at a standstill. He has not yet failed in his campaign promise. Not all is at
      fundamental impasse. Trump’s alternatives at this point is either to follow the
      advice of his neocon advisers and provide Ukraine with more weapons and threaten
      the Russians that more US actions are forthcoming if they don’t come to the negotiating
      table. But this is essentially the Biden plan which produced no results for the
      prior three years.  It is also the US neocons’ position real Plan A. They may
      have gone along with the Kellogg Plan B knowing full well it would collapse. Trump’s
      other choice is to follow the advice of others like Witkoff and Vance in his administration
      to cut Ukraine loose and end all current US military assistance.  Let events evolve
      on the ground for the next six months and intervene again later this year when
      one or both parties, Ukraine and/or Russia, are more amenable to a compromise.
      Trump now appears drifting in the direction of the neocons’ plan to resurrect
      Plan A somehow and away from the opposing view that the only choice is to cut
      losses and let the Europeans have their war in Ukraine if they want. As this article
      is written, reports are that Trump now wants a direct face to face meeting in
      May with Putin in Saudi Arabia in May.  This suggests either he’s not too confident
      he’s directly getting the facts from his neocon advisers; or perhaps he thinks
      he can hammer out a deal over the table with Putin—as if he were concluding some
      kind of corporate acquisition where both sides ‘horse trade’ the main remaining
      unresolved issues on the table at the 11 th hour to seal a deal. If the latter,
      he’ll have some difficulty convincing the Russians he’s not just another western
      politician who makes promises, even signs documents, on which he then reneges—just
      as occurred in 2015 with the Minsk II agreement and again in Istanbul in 2022
      when the war could have ended were it not for European NATO intervention convincing
      Zelensky to continue the conflict. Jack Rasmus May 4, 2025'

    paragraph_summary: The recent signing of the Ukraine Minerals Deal 2.0 by the Trump
      administration marks a significant departure from the original proposal made in
      March, which has been characterized as a capitulation by Trump. Initially, the
      deal was to be announced in a high-profile meeting at the White House with Ukrainian
      President Zelensky, but tensions escalated, leading to Zelensky's refusal to agree
      to the terms, which included using mineral revenue to repay the U.S. for military
      aid. Zelensky had insisted that any such agreement must be accompanied by a formal
      U.S. security guarantee, a condition that was not met, resulting in the breakdown
      of negotiations. The new deal, while signed, reflects a compromise that lacks
      the security assurances Zelensky sought, indicating a shift in the dynamics of
      U.S.-Ukraine relations regarding mineral rights and financial obligations.

      a provision for Ukraine to repay the US for past aid, which was previously touted

      50% of a joint Investment Fund, but it remains unclear if the US will receive
      50% of the revenues generated. The deal ensures that all revenues will be reinvested
      in Ukraine for the next decade, with no funds being withdrawn. Additionally, a
      new loophole allows for US weapons sent to Ukraine to count as reinvestment in
      the fund. Notably, only one of the three signed documents has been disclosed,
      raising questions about potential undisclosed agreements, possibly including a
      US security guarantee for Ukraine. This shift in the Minerals Deal reflects a

  - title: Why Trump’s Ukraine War ‘Kellogg Plan’ Collapsed
    url: https://jackrasmus.com/2025/04/25/why-trumps-ukraine-war-kellogg-plan-collapsed/
    text: 'When President Trump ran for office in 2024 he promised to negotiate an end
      to the war in Ukraine within 100 days of taking office.  The unofficial centerpiece
      of his plan was the proposals raised publicly by US General Kellogg earlier in
      2024. While Trump in 2024 did not officially adopt the Kellogg proposals as his
      plan to end the war, it is clear in retrospect he unofficially embraced the Kellogg
      plan. One of his first unofficially appointments before even taking office in
      January was to task Kellogg to explore responses to his—Kellogg’s— proposals among
      the interested parties. It is important to note that the Trump plan to negotiate
      an end to the war during his first 100 days in office has been the Kellogg Plan,
      revised somewhat to represent a US political compromise within the Trump administration
      between the Trump neocons—Rubio, Walz, etc.—and those in the administration who
      advocate a faster US extrication from the costly and unwinnable war—i.e. Vance,
      Witkoff, et. al. Thus a ‘Kellogg Plus’ US plan. At this past week’s EU/UK meeting
      in London, however, ‘Kellogg Plus’ died and was buried. Put on the table for discussion
      by the USA as a possible unified west/NATO solution to end the Ukraine war by
      a  compromise with Russian positions, the Kellogg plan was never even discussed
      by the Europeans or the Ukrainian delegation sent to London. It was rejected and
      ‘killed off’ by a unified Europe & Ukraine opposition. As others have reported,
      the Europeans and Ukraine had developed their own set of proposals over the past
      few weeks in the flurry of their meetings in Europe, the most recent occurring
      in Paris. London was the meeting in which the Europeans expected the US delegation
      to discuss the Euro-Ukraine plan which differed substantially from the US ‘Kellogg
      Plus’ proposals. The US reportedly caught the Europeans by surprise, presented
      their plan for discussion in lieu of the Europeans’.  The latter then refused
      to discuss the Kellogg plan and, in return, the US delegation left the meeting..
      Having had a copy of the US plan just before the London meeting, Zelensky publicly,
      and in somewhat insulting language, rejected the US plan outright. He followed
      up after the meeting with another public statement to the media declaring “There
      is nothing to talk about”.  His European supporters, notably Macron of France
      and Starmer of UK, quickly joined him and publicly declared the same. It is now
      clear the US proposals are rejected in their entirety, both by Ukraine and the
      Europeans The US had announced its plan was its ‘best and final offer’ to all
      the parties as the basis for starting negotiations, including Russia, and threatened
      to exit the negotiations process altogether if not accepted by all.  Whether it
      does has yet to be determined. On April 25, 2025, Trump special envoy met with
      Putin in Moscow to discuss the same Kellogg proposals. It is highly likely Putin
      will not accept the offer in its entirety either, but may accept some elements
      and declare it a basis to continue discussions—unlike Zelensky or the Europeans
      who have rejected it outright and completely. Given that total rejection—and regardless
      of the outcome of the Witkoff-Putin meeting in Moscow, it is clear the first phase
      of the Trump administration’s attempt to negotiate an end to the Ukraine conflict
      has come to an abrupt end. So what was the Kellogg Plan proposed by the USA that
      was so abruptly shot down by Zelensky and the Europeans? And what was their alternative
      proposal that they thought the US would accept as the starting point of negotiations
      with the Russians—a move by the Europeans to put them back in the negotiations
      game alongside the Americans as equals, a role so far denied them to their great
      consternation? Here are the main elements of the Kellogg Plus American plan: No
      NATO membership offered to Ukraine nor Ukraine to seek membership, although Ukraine
      could join the European Union Recognition de jure of Crimea as part of Russia
      and Lughansk province now fully occupied by Russia Ceasefire implementation details
      to be worked out by Russia & Ukraine, without Europe or US participation Recognition
      de facto the other three east Ukraine regions (Donetsk, Zaporozhie, Kherson) now
      occupied by Russian forces along the current combat line Lifting of US sanctions
      since 2014 on Russia, leaving Europe sanctions to Europe to decide Europe could
      offer Ukraine security guarantees if it wanted but the USA would not US and Russia
      would continue to explore joint deals on energy and industry The US would operate
      the Zaporozhie nuclear power plant and distribute its resources to both Ukraine
      and Russia Russia also gives up its control of the dam on the Dnipr, its territory
      in Kherson where the nuclear power plant is located, its occupation of far western
      ‘spit’ of Kherson on the river, and the area in the Kharkov province Russia also
      now occupies US & Ukraine conclude a minerals deal, with participation by Europe
      as well The Plan said nothing about the size of Ukraine’s army after the war’s
      end In negotiations of agreements, sometimes what’s left out intentionally is
      as important as what’s included. Here’s some key omissions in the US plan: No
      reference to the size of the Ukrainian military as part of a peace deal, or whether
      Ukraine could build up its forces while ceasefire and negotiations continued No
      reference to whether NATO troops were to participate in any peacekeeping operations
      in Ukraine after the war No mention of whether or how Ukraine might be compensated
      and rebuilt, by whom, or whether Russia’s $260 billion assets in European banks
      would be used The Europeans were shocked, reportedly, by the provisions of the
      Kellogg Plus plan. They had expected the US to attend London to discuss the plan
      they had alternatively hammered out in the preceding weeks with the assumed approval
      of Ukraine.  That alternative plan was fundamentally different from the USA’s.
      In fact, it is better described not as a plan to reach some kind of a compromise
      settlement to the conflict, but a plan that amounted to a capitulation of Russia
      in the conflict. The Europeans proposed something historically similar to the
      France-Britain 1918 armistice agreement on Germany that ended world war I.  That
      armistice was a ceasefire after which the victors—France and Britain—imposed impossible
      terms on Germany, which were eventually forced on Germany and which, in the end
      historically, led to the continuation of the world war in 1939. The 1918 negotiations
      was an agreement forced by victors on the defeated. The problem in Ukraine today,
      is that the Russians are clearing winning militarily and it is the Ukrainians
      and Europeans who are likely the defeated before this year’s end on the battlefield.
      Here’s the elements of the Europeans-Ukraine 2025 ‘Armistice Plan’, which they
      had hoped, were the USA to accept as basis for negotiations, would put them—the
      Europeans—back on an equal footing in negotiations with the USA that the latter
      has thus far denied them since discussions between the US and Russia were opened
      in Riyadh and Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, in March. The Main Elements of the European
      Armistice Plan: Russia & Ukraine accept an unconditional ceasefire. Details of
      the implementation of the ceasefire subsequently negotiate by all four parties
      together: Russia, Ukraine, Europe and USA Russia required to return all prisoners,
      troops and children allegedly kidnapped but no mention of Ukraine similar release
      of prisoners, etc. Security Guarantees to Ukraine provided by US and Europe, along
      lines of NATO article 5 language; Ukraine may join NATO at a later date No limits
      or restrictions on Ukraine’s size of military. Ukraine allowed to rebuild army
      and weapons during ceasefire negotiations Europe and other States may send troops
      to Ukraine as part of peacekeeping force No reference made to Russia right to
      Crimea or other occupied territories Ukraine to control the Zaporozhie nuclear
      power plant, with US only assisting. Also Ukraine control Dnipr river and its
      Khakovka dam Russian assets in European banks remain frozen until Ukraine compensation
      for damages is determined by negotiations Sanctions on Russia remain in place.
      Any relief of sanctions reinstated if Russia breaches agreement in any way It
      should be noted this European proposal is not the plan Ukraine has been proposing
      the last two and a half years. Ukraine/Zelensky’s position to end the war hasn’t
      changed since late 2022. Ukraine’s Terms for Ending the War: Almost three years
      to the day this April, following Russia’s initial invasion in February 2022 and
      territorial gains across Ukraine, Russia and Ukraine representatives met in Istanbul,
      Turkey and worked out details of terms tentatively to end the conflict. The terms
      of Istanbul I, as it is called, included Ukraine agreeing not to join NATO, Crimea
      remaining in Russia but the other four provinces of east Ukraine remaining in
      Ukraine providing assurances were given its almost total Russian population be
      allowed to practice its Russian Orthodox religion, speak Russian, and continue
      other cultural practices—all of which were being denied by the Kiev regime at
      the time in the hands of ultra-nationalist, proto fascist forces intent on denying
      the same to its eastern Russian population. The shelling of cities in the east
      by Ukraine forces also had to stop. Ukraine tentatively agreed to Istanbul I,
      took the terms back to Zelensky in Kiev, who reportedly was considering signing
      them—until then UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, flew into Kiev and convinced
      Zelensky that unlimited NATO funds and weaponry would be forthcoming, that Russia
      would collapse politically and economically if Ukraine resisted militarily and
      the war with Russia should therefore continue.  Zelensky ultimately agreed. Istanbul
      was abandoned and, after the initial Ukrainian tactical victories in the summer
      of 2022, Zelensky and Ukraine adopted the following hard line positions for negotiations
      that Ukraine formally retains to this day: Russia should immediately exit all
      Ukraine territories, including Crimea After exit, Ukraine will commence negotiations
      with Russia Negotiation topics to focus on reparations paid to Ukraine by Russia
      War crime tribunals of Russia leaders in Europe to follow Ukraine never to cede
      control of the Zaporozhie nuclear plant to anyone It will never agree to any limits
      or reductions of its military forces Europe must agree to let Ukraine into NATO
      or else provide it Article 5 NATO equivalent security guarantees Russia’s Terms
      for Ending the War As Ukraine’s position evolved in the course of the first year
      of the war, so too did Russia’s.  After its initial offer in Istanbul in April
      2022, and its retreat from areas around Kiev and in the south in Kherson Russian
      demands stiffened as well. That fall 2022, as Ukraine demands total capitulation
      by Russian forces, Putin established a new Russian position: At the center of
      that was that now after referenda were conducted in the four regions of East Ukraine
      showing over-whelming voting to join Russia, the four provinces were now legally
      part of Russia and were non-negotiable. Other Russian demands were Ukraine must
      not join NATO, must become neutral between Europe and Russia, and its government
      must be purged of fascist elements to ensure the same. In early 2024 Putin gave
      an interview with US journalist, Tucker Carlson. In it he made an interesting
      remark which has largely been ignored by western media and which may yet be raised
      as part of any ultimate negotiations.  In it he described the far west Ukraine
      as not really part of the Slavic homeland of Russia, Ukraine and Belarus.  He
      noted that territory was formerly Poland and Romania and was given by Stalin to
      Ukraine at the end of World War II. It was an historic hotbed of fascism and the
      region had strongly supported the Nazis in the world war, often doing their dirty
      work on the local resistance and the jews.  Putin then suggested if the west wanted
      this region, he didn’t have any great opposition to it, if they were that foolish
      to accept its inherent pro fascist elements. Later in June 2024 Putin established
      Russia’s most recent position for a negotiated end of the conflict which has remained
      to this day. These terms include: No NATO membership for Ukraine Political neutrality
      by Ukraine Ukraine government remove neo-nazi politicians from its government
      Recognize that Crimea and the four provinces are now legally part of Russia To
      ensure Ukraine is no threat to Russia, it must reduce its military force to around
      80,000 Why European Obstinacy Toward Continuing the War? Many observers in America
      and elsewhere in the world have been perplexed about why the European leadership—especially
      those of the larger countries Britain, France and now Germany—have been so consistently
      in favor of continuing the war?  They ask questions like: don’t they (European
      leaders) see that the war cannot be won? That Ukraine is losing? That it may mean
      an irrevocable split between the USA and Europe and break up of NATO itself? Can
      Europe actually go it alone, providing the massive funding to Ukraine and weapons
      it clearly does not have the economic base to produce by itself? Here’s some possible
      explanations for the European obstinate support for Zelensky, Ukraine and for
      continuing the war: European leaders are politically committed in terms of their
      personal careers to the war, both at national and Euro-wide institutional (EU
      Commission, EU Council, etc.) levels. Should the war end on Russian terms, it
      will be perceived as a personal defeat for them with repercussions for their personal
      careers War is often a convenient diversion by politicians from problems at home
      in their own constituencies. It’s not the first time in history politicians start
      and continue wars to stay in office Some European/NATO have a visceral bias against
      and hate for anything Russian. This is especially true of the Baltics states’
      leaders and also to some extent for Poland, Finland, and even for Britain The
      War continuance serves to keep NATO from falling apart (while it also has the
      opposite effect). So long as the war continues, perhaps US and Trump can not leave
      NATO so quickly or completely The War is clearly pushing Europe toward building
      its own defense industry and independent military force. For decades it’s been
      overly dependent on the US for weapons provision and massive funding of NATO operations
      in Europe which has meant significant US dollars inflow to Europe.  Europe leaders
      now talk of spending trillions of Euros on defense, important for boosting an
      otherwise slowing stagnating real economy for almost two decades now. Without
      the war—and media manufactured threat of an eventual Russia invasion of Europe
      should it win in Ukraine—it is impossible for Europe to spend trillions Euros
      planned for a new defense industry. One must assume some European leaders—especially
      those less competent in the umbrella EU Commission, EU Council, etc—actually believe
      Russia will invade Europe after Ukraine with a Russian army barely a million when
      it took 15 million Russians to take east Europe and Germany during world war II
      at the cost of 20 million killed. Some European generals and no doubt politicians
      have stated and believe that Russia will lose the war if NATO just stays committed
      and fights for another year. This is the original argument that dominated NATO
      thinking back in 2022: that Russia’s economy can sustain a war for long and opposition
      to Putin will quickly result in his overthrow.  How that view succeeds today after
      three years of evidence to the contrary is difficult to understand. Ukraine’s
      and Zelensky’s obstinacy and existential commitment to continue the war is more
      understandable and rational, notwithstanding its inevitable failure. Zelensky
      must continue to war in order to continue martial law and, in turn, remain in
      office given that his authority as president expired in May 2024 and he’s no longer
      actually the president.  Should the war end elections in Ukraine will be held
      and he will almost certainly be forced out of his current role. Without the protection
      of his office he then becomes personally vulnerable from several directions. He’ll
      be blamed by the radical nationalists for losing Ukraine territory and the death
      of hundreds of thousands Ukrainians will have been in vain. They’ll come after
      him. The Russian secret services may do the same indirectly. Or perhaps some everyday
      Russian, or Ukrainian, citizen who’ll blame him for their family losses. He won’t
      have the level of personal protection he enjoyed from the Americans, and now the
      British, will in office. The War keeps the radical nationalists on his side so
      long as the fighting continues and he remains obstinate about any negotiations
      with the prospect of even the slightest compromise. There’s also the question
      of a wide spectrum of Ukraine society and political-social forces that have grown
      dependent on the flow of money from the west. Many politicians and political interests
      have been sharing in that western funds injection. Per Zelensky himself, Ukraine
      must spend $8 billion a month just as government workers wages and pensions. Ukraine’s
      broken economy cannot generate that. Then there are the hordes of shadowy arms
      traders making money off the flow of funds and weapons. And Ukraine companies
      and their western investors as well. Trump’s Next Moves? There’s been much conjecture
      in the US media, and talk by Trump administration team assigned to the war, that
      should the parties not accept the Trump Kellogg Plus plan then the US will simply
      walk away from the negotiations.  That’s not likely. There’s many ways to continue
      negotiations. In the case of Russia and US that’s simple as part of the future
      meetings planned to discuss restoring diplomatic relations and defining economic
      deals and cooperation. Some clarity where Trump’s going next may emerge from the
      WItkoff-Putin meeting now underway.  Trump needs Putin to agree to something to
      keep the ball rolling and keep at bay US critics who’ll say it’s futile to negotiate
      with Putin and Russia. On the other hand, Putin cannot embrace too much a plan
      that clearly is designed to get Russia to de facto freeze the war in place or
      even slow Russian offensives. The war cannot be concluded by negotiations designed
      to end the fighting; it can only be concluded on the battlefield that leads to
      negotiations that then conclude the conflict. The most likely outcome of the war
      is a military one.  Russia will have to take more territory in order to convince
      Ukraine and Europe allies that if it doesn’t agree to Russia’s fundamental demands
      Ukraine may lose even more territory. Russia will need to succeed in major new
      offensives in the north and south to create that realization and scenario. The
      question is whether Russia’s Special Military Operation, SMO, is sufficiently
      large enough to do so. 800,000 men and voluntary recruits may not prove sufficient.
      It should not be forgotten that Ukraine was ‘conquered’ in 1944-45 by a force
      of more than three million in arms. Modern technology perhaps does not require
      that many but nonetheless requires more than 800,000 given the scope of the front
      lines and the fact Russia, while it has an advantage of 2 to 1 in combat manpower,
      that ratio is probably not enough for a complete military victory. However, one
      more proviso is relevant. It’s not impossible that Ukraine’s army collapses later
      this summer, especially if the USA and Trump pull out of weapons deliveries and
      discontinue surveillance and targeting support for Ukraine forces. But that depends
      on Trump’s next after next move. Returning with a token concession from the Witkoff-Putin
      meeting is not sufficient. To end the war, as Trump says he wants to do, will
      require a hard break of US involvement militarily, logistically and financially—and
      soon.  He will have to ‘bite the bullet’ no later than June and cut Ukraine loose.
      And perhaps ‘stick a stake’ in the political heart of those Europeans who have
      been playing the USA to provide them their military toys and games for almost
      eighty years now. Dr. Jack Rasmus, April 25, 2025'
    one_sentence_summary: In his 2024 campaign, President Trump promised to negotiate
      an end to the Ukraine war within 100 days, unofficially adopting US General Kellogg's
      proposals as a basis for his plan, while balancing differing views within his
      administration on the approach to the conflict.
    paragraph_summary: In his 2024 presidential campaign, Donald Trump promised to negotiate
      an end to the Ukraine war within 100 days of taking office, largely based on proposals
      from US General Kellogg. Although Trump did not officially adopt the Kellogg proposals,
      he informally embraced them and tasked Kellogg with exploring responses from relevant
      parties. The resulting plan, dubbed 'Kellogg Plus,' aimed to balance the views
      of pro-war neoconservatives and those advocating for a quicker US withdrawal.
      However, during a recent EU/UK meeting in London, the 'Kellogg Plus' plan was
      effectively rejected by European and Ukrainian representatives, who had developed
      their own proposals that diverged significantly from the US plan. The US delegation's
      unexpected presentation of the Kellogg plan led to its dismissal, highlighting
      a rift between US and European strategies regarding the conflict.
