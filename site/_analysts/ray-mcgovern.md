      For men such as Washington, Jefferson, Madison and Monroe the threat of losing
      the humans they enslaved was a decisive factor in going to war, writes Ace Thelin.


      By Ace Thelin


      Special to Consortium News


      It’s long past time Americans face the truth about the Founding Fathers. A critique
      that places events being celebrated on the Fourth of July in a much larger world
      historical narrative is urgently needed.


      The power of empire is not only the power to control land, labor, armies and financial
      industries, but also to control minds.


      The dominion of the U.S. Empire has turned history upside down. It has transformed
      some of the biggest criminals into heroes. A history that emphasizes the U.S.
      as an exemplar of democracy and human rights and holds the constitution as sacrosanct
      is a history that lies by omission and ignores some of the most important events
      in its story.


      Historian Gerald Horne places the creation of the United States in a larger context
      in his seminal work, The Counter-Revolution of 1776- Slave Resistance and the
      Origins of the United States of America. He points out that while so many historical
      accounts of the American War for Independence begin in the 1770s or the decades
      preceding it, to understand the forces at play we must go back at least to the
      late 17th century and the “Glorious Revolution” of 1688 in England.


      This revolution saw the ascendant merchant class overthrowing Catholic King James
      II and installing his daughter Mary and her Protestant Dutch husband, William
      III of Orange, whose country, the Netherlands, was facing the onslaught of an
      aggressive Catholic France under Louis XIV. A Bill of Rights, very similar to
      the U.S. Bill of Rights, was made law in a parliamentarian show of force, further
      diminishing the power of the king.


      What is lesser known about the “Glorious Revolution” of 1688 was the effect on
      the trade in African bodies. With the king and the Royal African Company losing
      control of the slave trade, it became unregulated and the venture capitalists,
      pirates and investor class profited from the emerging global economy, based on
      the most valuable “commodity” of all.


      The “free trade” in Africans became, along with the genocide of the Native Americans,
      the two original sins and foundational crimes in the European conquest of the
      Western Hemisphere.


      Not only were European investors stealing returns of up to 1700 percent on their
      capital, enslaved Africans working on plantations in the Caribbean made the European
      empires the most powerful in the world. Sugar, tobacco, alcohol, rice, indigo,
      cotton and coffee changed the appetites of Europe, and not for the better.


      Centuries of Rebellion


      Africans resisted slavery everywhere. And wherever the numbers of Africans enslaved
      greatly outnumbered the enslavers, the latter feared or faced the constant threat
      of revolution. British slavery in the Caribbean, on the islands of Jamaica, Antigua
      and Barbados was rife with continuous revolts against the European colonisers.


      In Jamaica, escaped Africans known as Maroons successfully freed themselves from
      Spanish slavery and continued to wreak havoc on the English slave camps after
      the island fell to the English in 1655. By 1739 London was forced to make a treaty
      recognising Maroon sovereignty over sections of the island.


      The mainland 13 colonies insisted that Africans were not to be armed, that there
      could be no advancement or upward mobility for the enslaved. This created a dilemma
      for the expanding British empire which was competing with the Spanish empire that
      had a long established practice of arming free and enslaved Africans.


      The Spanish stronghold of St. Augustine in Florida was a sanctuary for Africans
      escaping from the English Carolinas. After converting to Catholicism and swearing
      allegiance to Spain, former slaves were sent northward on guerrilla raids against
      the fledgling plantations of the enemy. Arming the enslaved and subsequent refugees
      from English slavery helped Spain to hold the Florida frontier against British
      raids in 1728 and a major land and naval assault in 1740.


      Seven Years War


      The North American political map was radically altered in the 7 Years War (French
      and Indian War), when the British pushed back the French and Spanish. The French
      were forced out of the Ohio River valley and the Spanish lost the strategic city
      of Havana, Cuba, in 1762.


      While fought largely to secure the English colonies, the results of the war would
      have unintended consequences for the British Empire. With the Catholic empires
      of France and Spain setback, emboldened settler colonists would double down on
      the slave economy, just as the British Empire was becoming more dependent on using
      Africans in the military.


      In the 1762 attack on Havana, the British used “a combined force of 4,000 Redcoats,
      a regiment of five hundred free Negroes and two thousand enslaved Africans from
      Jamaica.”


      These two forces: the expansion of slavery in British North American colonies
      in the mid-18th century and the increased military use and upward mobility of
      Africans in Britain’s growing global empire would create contrasting visions for
      how mainland settler colonists and London regarded exploiting Africans.


      Somerset’s Case & the Slaveholders’ Revolt of 1776


      The British system of enslaving Africans was shaken to the core in a pivotal judicial
      case in June 1772. Stolen from Africa in 1749, James Somerset was bought in Virginia
      by Charles Steuart and later enslaved in Boston, before being shipped to England.
      With a history of fleeing, Somerset was in England where his master was seeking
      to sell him. Found shackled aboard a ship on the Thames, abolitionists rallied
      to his cause in what came to be known as Somerset’s Case.


      It was Magistrate Lord Mansfield, of Scottish origin, who freed Somerset, ruling
      that slavery could not exist in England. The ruling did not abolish slavery in
      Britain’s colonies but it was seen as a move in that direction by colonial elites
      who interpreted the case as London siding with the enslaved over the slaveholder.


      Widely discussed throughout the colonies, this ruling amplified the schism between
      the colonies and London, with the British Empire moving away from slavery and
      the colonial separatists moving toward an independent, republican slavocracy to
      defend, maintain and preserve slavery long into the future.


      All Men Are Created Equal?


      When Father-of-Slaves (Thomas Jefferson) wrote the Declaration of Independence
      in 1776, the war against the British had just begun. The colonial ruling class
      separatists needed an army to defeat the British Empire.


      The Declaration of Independence famously stated that “all men are created equal,
      that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among
      these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.” In his initial draft of
      the declaration, Jefferson attacked George III for the transatlantic slave trade,
      but did not condemn the institution of slavery. There was a burgeoning internal
      slave market in North America.


      Jefferson also complained in the deleted section of the first draft that George
      III was inciting slaves in America to turn on their masters. He wrote:


      “He is now exciting those very people to rise in arms among us, and to purchase
      that liberty of which he has deprived them, by murdering the people on whom he
      also obtruded them: thus paying off former crimes committed against the LIBERTIES
      of one people, with crimes which he urges them to commit against the LIVES of
      another.”


      Father-Of-Slaves was attempting to solidify a white identity that would transcend
      the class, religious, ethnic and national conflicts of Europe. Somehow when settlers
      crossed the Atlantic they magically became White and were welcomed into the project
      of enslaving Africans and conquering indigenous lands. Jefferson had six children
      with his “property,” Sally Hemings and enslaved over 600 human beings in his lifetime.


      The 27th and last grievance issued to King George III in the Declaration states,


      “He has excited domestic Insurrections amongst us, and has endeavored to bring
      on the Inhabitants of our Frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages whose known
      Rule of Warfare, is an undistinguished Destruction of all Ages, Sexes, and Conditions.(sic)”


      This last grievance in the declaration reveals the two original sins, and motivations
      that drove the colonial ruling class to separate from their country and support
      a ruling class war for independence. A war that would establish a white supremacist,
      patriarchal, expansionist government that could unify feuding European identities.


      Ned Blackhawk, in his 2023 book The Rediscovery of America, connects the formation
      of whiteness to the theft of indigenous land and enslavement of Africans:


      “Indigenous dispossession facilitated the growth of white male democracy and African
      American slavery. Each grew from the same trunk of expansion while also sowing
      the seeds of American disunion. Indeed, many of the nation’s longest-standing
      racial inequalities remain rooted in this half century of racial formation, one
      in which American lawmakers struggled to establish legible distinctions between
      ‘red,’ ‘white,’ and ‘black,’ people. That struggle became ideological. It became
      social. It became political, and it eventually became legal.”


      Lord Dunmore’s Emancipation Proclamation


      In 1775, months after the battles of Lexington and Concord in Massachusetts triggered
      the American War for Independence, the British issued their version of the Emancipation
      Proclamation. In November 1775, Lord John Dunmore, British Colonial governor of
      Virginia, promised “freedom” to any enslaved person in exchange for joining the
      British army.


      Virginians and all slavers were shocked, Destroyer of Villages (George Washington)
      called Lord Dunmore “that arch-traitor to the rights of humanity.” The British
      were moving to end slavery — as President Abraham Lincoln would do nearly a century
      later — in order to save the union.


      For men whose power stemmed directly from slavery, men like Washington, Jefferson,
      James Madison and James Monroe, the threat of losing the humans they enslaved
      and thus their power, was a decisive factor in their decision to go to war.


      Edward Rutledge, who would become governor of South Carolina, said that Dunmore’s
      Proclamation, more than anything else, would “work an eternal separation between
      Great Britain and the colonies.”


      So what exactly did Jefferson mean by “endeavoured to bring on the Inhabitants
      of our Frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages whose known Rule of Warfare, is
      an undistinguished Destruction of all Ages, Sexes, and Conditions?”


      The Proclamation Line of 1763


      The War for Independence 1775-1783, may have been a war against the British empire
      but make no mistake, it was also a war against First Nations and the result of
      the war was an ominous sign for the future of both enslaved Africans and the stewards
      of Turtle Island.


      The British had drawn a political line, The Proclamation of 1763, along the crest
      of the Appalachians: a political boundary that marked the border of the British
      Empire in colonial North America. The proclamation came after the French and Indian
      War 1756-1763, that ended with the French defeated and forced to cede all land
      claims east of the Mississippi to the British.


      While the proclamation upset white settlers living on native lands who wanted
      the support of the government to help steal more land from the natives, it also
      upset the most passionate and successful land speculators and master thieves such
      as Destroyer of Villages (Washington) and Father of Slaves (Jefferson). Between
      1747 and 1799 Washington surveyed over 200 tracts of land and held title to more
      than 65,000 acres in 37 different locations.


      Preemptive War


      As the War of Independence approached, the settler colonists and slaveholders
      knew that whatever side native nations chose to support would play an important
      role in determining the outcome of the war.


      The most powerful native confederation of the time was the Haudenosaunee (Six
      Nations Iroquois). Among these, the Seneca followed the Mohawks in joining the
      British. The Cayuga, Tuscarora, and Onondaga nations remained neutral and only
      the Christianised Oneidas sided with the separatist settlers.


      In response, Conotocaurius or Destroyer of Villages (the name given Washington
      by the Haudenosaunee) wrote instructions to Major General John Sullivan to make
      a preemptive attack on the Haudenosaunee,


      “to lay waste all the settlements around … that the country may not be merely
      overrun but destroyed … Our future security will be in their inability to injure
      us … and in the terror with which the severity of the chastisement they receive
      will inspire them.”


      General Sullivan replied,


      “The Indians shall see that there is malice enough in our hearts to destroy everything
      that contributes to their support.”


      During the war for Independence the “Americans” would burn over 50 Haudenosaunee
      villages to the ground and if that weren’t enough, Destroyer of Villages added,
      “it will be essential to ruin their crops now in the ground and prevent their
      planting more.” They burned the corn and other crops just before a severe winter,
      leaving many to die from cold and starvation.


      The American separatists would go on to destroy over 100 Cherokee towns and many
      other native villages. This was, in all likelihood left out of the history books
      you read in school. Under the leadership of Destroyer of Villages, this first
      war for “American Independence” was a war against natives and a way of life that
      honored the land.


      This same land conquered by the separatists would become the only source of revenue
      for the new government as defined in their first constitution: the Articles of
      Confederation.


      Forming a More Perfect Union?


      The reality of U.S. colonial expansion and empire building reveals the true motivations
      that fueled the machinery of power behind the Constitution and why it is so important
      to understand what the Constitution was designed to do.


      The Constitutional Convention was held in the aftermath of a rebellion in Massachusetts
      that challenged the tenuous control colonial elites held over the impoverished
      population. Shay’s Rebellion demonstrated the intensity of long-running class
      conflicts. Named after Daniel Shays, a veteran of the War for Independence, the
      uprising was a struggle of farmers for their land, against a Massachusetts oligarchy,
      that was forcing them into debt and off their land.


      Shay’s Rebellion was a movement comprised of hundreds of farmers and working class
      whites in western Massachusetts, unifying and marching on courthouses demanding
      an end to high property taxes. This working class rebellion put a fright into
      the colonial ruling class. Virginian elite and their allies moved to seize power
      and frame the new Constitution to their liking.


      In the summer of 1787, colonial rulers held a secret convention in Philadelphia
      to amend the Articles of Confederation. What they left with was a document that
      guaranteed slavery, and the racism to justify it would remain part of the United
      States for the foreseeable future.


      The 3/5 clause of the constitution — determining the number of representatives
      per state — granted that the total number of people counted in a state would include
      3/5ths of the total number of enslaved Africans. The 3/5ths “compromise” was a
      power grab that gave the southern states majority control of the central government.


      The electoral college, based on the very same lopsided pro-slavery representation,
      ensured that the presidency would be in the hands of the enslavers. Four of the
      first five presidents were Virginian slave masters. They all served two terms.
      They ruled for 32 of the first 36 years of the Empire. They conquered, plundered
      and aggressively expanded the Republic-Empire from the East Coast and declared
      in 1820, with the Monroe Doctrine, that all of the Western Hemisphere was under
      the dominion of the U.S., not to be interfered with by European powers.


      The U.S. Constitution written in Philadelphia, in 1787, was a Virginian and Southern
      slave plantation owners’ coup. By wedding slavery to power, the constitution rewarded
      and incentivized the enslavement of Africans. This first slavocracy was imposed
      by those who profited from the free market of African bodies and guaranteed that
      slavery would define the new nation enforced by the collaboration of a pan European
      white identity.


      Of Virginia’s total population of 747,610 people counted in the 1790 census, 292,627
      were enslaved. There were more enslaved Africans in Virginia than the total population
      of people in states such as Vermont, New Hampshire, Maine, Rhode Island, Connecticut,
      New Jersey, Delaware, Kentucky, South Carolina and Georgia.


      By 1860, on the eve of the Civil War the number of enslaved humans in Virginia
      was 550,000. This number is misleading however, for Virginia benefited from the
      end of the legal foreign slave trade in 1808, as written and planned in the constitution.


      Virginia became the domestic breeding ground for exporting slaves to the deep
      south, where they would also count in the census for the slave states. Frighteningly,
      the “founding fathers” designed a document in which they could literally rape
      and breed their way to increased political power.


      The transformation necessary to create a system that works for everyone will never
      be achieved as long as Americans believe the U.S. was founded by visionaries with
      high ideals. For far too long have Americans accepted the lies and celebrated
      a fantasy.

    one_sentence_summary: The article argues that the Founding Fathers' motivations
      for the American War of Independence were deeply intertwined with the preservation
      of slavery and the control of enslaved people, challenging the traditional narrative
      that celebrates them as heroes of democracy while overlooking their roles in perpetuating

    paragraph_summary: In his article, Ace Thelin argues that the narrative surrounding
      the Founding Fathers of the United States needs a critical reevaluation, particularly
      regarding their reliance on slavery and the oppression of Indigenous peoples.
      Thelin highlights how figures like Washington, Jefferson, Madison, and Monroe
      were driven to war partly by the fear of losing their enslaved labor force, framing
      the American War for Independence not just as a struggle against British rule,
      but also as a defense of a slaveholding society. He discusses the historical context
      of slavery, including the impact of the Glorious Revolution and the British abolitionist
      movements, which intensified the colonial elites' resolve to maintain slavery.
      The article critiques the U.S. Constitution as a document designed to uphold and
      institutionalize slavery, benefitting the Southern slaveholders and perpetuating
      racial inequality. Thelin calls for a more honest understanding of American history
      that acknowledges these foundational injustices rather than romanticizing the
      nation's origins.

    text: 'Shares


      If America is to be what the Revolution envisioned on July 4, 1776, a nation governed
      by laws, then the American people must speak out and defend that vision, writes
      Dennis Kucinich.


      By Dennis Kucinich


      Substack


      In 1776, Thomas Paine set a revolutionary tone rejecting the King: “But where,
      say some, is the King of America? … as far as we approve of monarchy… in America
      the law is king.”


      The American Revolution replaced the authority of a sovereign with the authority
      of a written Constitution and a people who govern themselves. Paine’s vision was
      the bedrock of the American Revolution, a declaration that no person — not a king,
      not a president, not a general — would stand above the law.


      Today, nearly 250 years later, that vision is dimming, not because the words have
      faded, but because the institutions meant to uphold them have withered. And at
      the heart of this erosion is a truth too many fear to speak: we are witnessing
      the collapse of the implicit moral principles of the Declaration, the American
      promise of liberty under law.


      The conduct of America’s current chief executive recalls the cadence of the usurpations
      of George III, iterated in the July 4, 1776, Declaration of Independence. We have
      arrived at a George III moment.


      July 4, 2025: A People’s Declaration


      When in the course of constitutional history, it becomes evident that the executive
      has turned from protector to predator of the republic, a decent respect for the
      original Declaration requires a recounting of the abuses, usurpations and betrayals
      now taking place and a statement of recommitment to those primary principles celebrated
      each Independence Day.


      We reaffirm the Letter of the Declaration of Independence from 1776, as contrasted
      with the 2025 assault on the government of American people.


      1776: “All… are created equal,” the principle of inherent Equality. 2025: Trump
      has acted contrary to this ideal. He has dismantled Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
      (DEI) programs across the federal government, military and public education systems,
      undermining the nation’s legislated commitment to equality and pluralism, in great
      tension with the Equal Protection Clause, of the 14th Amendment. He has attempted
      to make illegitimate the social and political strivings of generations of Americans,
      and has punished institutions seeking to uphold principles of equality.


      1776: “That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted….” This declarative
      principle is mirrored in Article I, U.S. Constitution; the government derives
      powers from consent of the governed. Government exists to serve the people, not
      the personal will of the Executive.


      2025: President Trump has:


      Declared wars without congressional consent, in direct violation of Article I,
      Section 8: Congress alone has power to declare war, as well as its derivative,
      the War Powers Resolution of 1973.


      He has initiated aggressive mass roundups of immigrants and citizens alike, resulting
      in detention of lawful residents and amid citizens being detained in error, undermining
      the Fifth and 14th Amendments, the due process clause and habeas corpus protections
      under Article I, Section 9.


      He has engaged in retaliatory defunding of academic institutions and students,
      undermining free speech and academic freedom, using an inherently misleading definition
      of “anti-Semitism” as a tool to suppress lawful speech on college campuses, punishing
      dissent, in an open assault on the First Amendment.


      1776: “He has refused his Assent to Laws…”


      2025: This president has engaged in unilateral military actions, bypassing Congress,
      disregarding constitutional and legislative checks on executive authority.


      1776: “He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States…”


      2025: The president has sanctioned indiscriminate roundups by masked agents, kidnappings,
      detentions and deportations violating due process, equal protection and established
      immigration law.


      1776: “He has obstructed the Administration of Justice…”


      2025: The president’s attacks on the federal judiciary have represent transparent
      political interference in the deliberations of the judiciary, a separate but equal
      branch of government, established by Article III of the Constitution


      1776: “He has erected a multitude of New Offices…”


      2025: The president’s appointment of central administrative vigilantes, known
      as the Department of Government Efficiency, (DOGE) destructive of the Appointments
      Clause and the Civil Service Act. Illegally and indiscriminately removed thousands
      of apolitical civil servants from their jobs.


      1776: “He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies…”


      2025: The president deployed the National Guard to Los Angeles, without a request
      from the state, in violation of the 10th Amendment and contrary to the Posse Comitatus
      Act (18 U.S.C. §1385), which forbids the use of federal troops for domestic law
      enforcement.


      1776: “He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the
      Civil power…”


      2025: Through ordering the use of the military for civilian enforcement, the president
      has eroded the separation between the military and civil authority.


      1776: “He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to
      our constitution…”


      2025: Through his unilateral action which has drawn the United States into foreign
      policy entanglements, the president skirted the Foreign Assistance Act by committing
      U.S. resources absent explicit congressional authorization and negated customary
      international law and jeopardized the safety and security of our nation.


      1776: “For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world…”


      2025: Through the imposition of trade sanctions without congressional input, the
      president has violated the Commerce Clause (Article I, Section 8) of the U.S.
      Constitution.


      1776: “For depriving us … of the benefits of Trial by Jury.”


      2025: The president has been instrumental in the denial of due process in immigration
      proceedings, including denying access to counsel and meaningful review.


      1776: “For transporting us beyond Seas…”


      2025: He has ordered deportation, willy nilly, and expedited removals to foreign
      jurisdictions, which denies access to judicial review, violating international
      law obligations under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights
      (ICCPR), Article 13.


      1776: “For suspending our own Legislatures…”


      2025: Through aggressive executive action and regulatory fiat in congressional
      jurisdiction, the president has diminished the practical role of Congress.


      1776: “He has excited domestic insurrections…”


      2025: He has used military force to suppress protest movements, labeling them
      insurrectionist, in conflict with 1st and 10th Amendment constitutional protections.


      The Ideals of the American Revolution


      A presidency, whose actions unfortunately so neatly align with the historical
      definitions of tyranny, as articulated in the Declaration of Independence, cannot
      be reconciled or trusted with the sacred values of constitutional governance.


      We therefore reaffirm our allegiance not to a person, not to an office, but to
      the Constitution of the United States of America and to the principles of 1776.
      Once again, here in 2025, let us “mutually pledge to each other our lives, our
      fortune, our sacred honor,” as did those patriots of so many years ago.


      The ideals of the American Revolution, stated boldly in the Declaration of Independence,
      ordained in the Preamble, established in the Constitution, and firmly emphasized
      in the Bill of Rights, require the rights of the people are paramount, and that
      governmental power be held in check.


      Laws must govern even the governors, lest law, bent by fear, ambition and partisan
      loyalty becomes a sword of repression.


      If America is to remain what the Revolution envisioned in 1776, a nation governed
      by laws, then we the people must speak out, we must act and defend that vision.


      Our freedom ultimately depends upon an enlightened, active citizenry. Otherwise
      we betray the past and surrender the future, and the nation fails.

      The former American republic is now an empire, the type of government from which
      Thomas Jefferson and his colleagues violently seceded, writes Andrew P. Napolitano.


      By Andrew P. Napolitano


      We are independent of London, but are we independent of Washington? Is there more
      freedom when governed by one tyrant 3,000 miles away or by 3,000 tyrants a few
      miles away?


      Does government today remotely resemble the values articulated on July 4th 1776?


      When the president of the United States bombs the lawful facilities of a foreign
      country that pose no threat whatsoever to American national security and does
      so without a congressional declaration of war as the Constitution requires; when
      thousands of non-violent folks in America are arrested by masked federal agents
      without warrants and kicked out of the country without due process; when troops
      patrol the streets of a large city in defiance of federal law; when both major
      political parties support mass surveillance, undeclared foreign wars and borrowing
      trillions of dollars a year to fund a bloated government — nearly all of which
      is nowhere countenanced by the Constitution — we can safely conclude that personal
      liberty in our once-free society has been radically diminished and is in the twilight
      of its existence.


      Two hundred and forty-nine years ago this week, Thomas Jefferson was fuming in
      his rented rooms in Philadelphia as the Continental Congress was softening the
      tone of his final draft of what would become the most critical document and radical
      articulation of the origins of human freedom in American history. [Read Jefferson’s
      first draft.]


      The Declaration of Independence is an indictment of King George III as well as
      a manifestation of limited government and maximum individual freedom.


      Though the final version dropped some of Jefferson’s more bellicose language,
      the document as we know it is largely his — not only his lofty language but also
      the three principal Jeffersonian values that it manifests.


      The first of those values is natural law. The natural law teaches that our rights
      come from our humanity and our humanity is a gift from God. Jefferson recognized
      this when he wrote that we are all created equal and endowed by our “Creator with
      certain unalienable Rights, and among these are Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit
      of Happiness.”


      Recognizing the origin of human freedom in the Creator and referring to our rights
      as inalienable expressly accepts the concept of natural law and thereby liberty,
      assembly, private property, travel, self-defense, due process and privacy every
      day.


      At the outset of the Declaration, Jefferson appealed to “the Laws of Nature’s
      God.” He could have appealed to the British tradition of individual rights. He
      could have appealed to the Magna Carta. He could have appealed to numerous acts
      of Parliament that stated — but pretended — that all men are equal and their rights
      are natural. But he didn’t.


      He appealed to the natural law.


      Consent of the Governed


      The second Jeffersonian value is the consent of the governed. Jefferson argued,
      and Congress agreed, that no government is moral or consistent with the natural
      law unless it enjoys the consent of all those it governs.


      Yet, historians today believe that at the time he wrote this, about one-third
      of the adult, white, land-owning males in the colonies supported revolution, about
      one-third opposed it, and about one-third were undecided.


      The very Congress that declared that no government is moral without the consent
      of the governed wouldn’t achieve the consent of even a majority until after the
      war.


      Surely, voting or walking on a government sidewalk is not consent. If you think
      it is, then the victims of 20th-century Nazism and Communism consented to those
      dreadful forms of government. Of course they didn’t.


      Consent today is a myth just as much of government today is a myth. We pretend
      that we have self-government. We pretend that we consented to it. We pretend that
      our elected officials actually do represent us. We pretend that we are all created
      equal.


      And we pretend that elections actually do change things in a material and substantial
      way. We even pretend that we have rights that the government protects. And we
      embrace these pretenses knowing all along that it is the government that assaults
      our rights, takes our property and kills in our names.


      Protecting Natural Rights


      The third Jeffersonian principle is that the proper role of government is not
      to give the people whatever they want but to protect their natural rights. Moreover,
      Jefferson wrote, whenever the government — even one consented to by the governed
      — is destructive of natural rights, the people may morally alter or abolish it.


      That was July 4, 1776.


      On July 4, 2025, the Jeffersonian principles that animated the just war for secession
      called the American Revolutionary War have all been discarded.


      Think about it: Do you know anyone today who has consented to the monster government
      we have today? A government that claims out of its own belly that it can right
      any wrong, regulate any behavior, tax any event, steal any property, transfer
      any wealth, borrow any amount and kill any person — foe, friend or imagined foe?


      The former American republic is now an empire, with an annual military budget
      — one trillion dollars! — that is larger than those of the next nine countries
      combined; and with troops on more than 750 American military installations in
      80 nations around the globe.


      As George III once boasted of his empire, the sun never sets on the American empire.


      Empire: That would be the form of government from which Jefferson and his colleagues
      violently and successfully seceded.


      Unchecked government is the archenemy of personal liberty. And a government that
      rejects its founding values, that keeps persons dependent upon it rather than
      independent of it, one that recognizes no limits to its powers and assaults the
      liberties of those it governs should be altered or abolished before liberty’s
      last gleaming becomes a long cold darkness.

      Justices stripped federal judges of their authority to protect people throughout
      the U.S. when the president breaks the law, writes Marjorie Cohn.


      By Marjorie Cohn


      Truthout




      Continuing in their shameful deference to the president, Donald Trump’s lackeys
      on the U.S. Supreme Court once again affirmed the superiority of the executive
      over the other two branches of government.


      Last year, the high court ruled that presidents are immune from prosecution when
      they carry out official functions. Now, that same court has stripped federal judges
      of their authority to protect people throughout the nation when the president
      breaks the law.


      More than two dozen nationwide (“universal”) injunctions blocking several of Trump’s
      policies were in effect as of mid-May. Those policies include a more stringent
      voter ID requirement; a rule requiring that mail-in ballots be received by Election
      Day; an effort to freeze $3 trillion in federal spending to review whether the
      disbursement of those funds aligned with administration policies; a demand that
      public schools eliminate DEI programs or risk losing some of the $75 billion in
      federal funds; and allowing over 25,000 children to enter deportation proceedings
      without lawyers.


      Trump v. CASA, Inc. came to the Supreme Court as a challenge to Trump’s Jan. 20
      executive order purporting to unilaterally outlaw the constitutional guarantee
      of birthright citizenship. But in its June 27 ruling, the high court didn’t actually
      decide the citizenship issue, which they kicked back to the lower federal courts.


      Instead, in a shocking decision, the Supreme Court held that federal judges cannot
      issue universal injunctions for actions that are almost certainly illegal. “Never
      before has the Supreme Court imposed such restrictions on the ability of courts
      to provide relief against unconstitutional acts,” Berkeley Law School Dean Erwin
      Chemerinsky wrote in The Los Angeles Times.


      The Supreme Court granted the request by the Trump administration to partially
      pause three federal court rulings that had blocked Trump’s executive order.


      Those courts had determined that only nationwide injunctions would provide the
      plaintiffs with complete relief because people constantly move in and out of states,
      and children born to noncitizen parents in a non-plaintiff state may later reside
      in a plaintiff state, and vice versa.


      Trump will likely continue to be barred from enforcing his order against the pregnant
      plaintiffs who challenged it. But the decision could affect any case in which
      a federal judge makes a ruling that encompasses people beyond the individuals
      who actually filed the lawsuit.


      The Supreme Court left open the question of whether courts could block government
      actions nationwide when there is no narrower judicial approach possible.


      Trump’s Order Purports to End Birthright Citizenship


      Section 1 of the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution — known as the “Citizenship
      Clause” — reads,


      “All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction
      thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.”


      Congress codified the Citizenship Clause in the Nationality Act of 1940.


      In the 1898 landmark decision of United States v. Wong Kim Ark, the Supreme Court
      held that the 14th Amendment guarantees citizenship to virtually all individuals
      born in the U.S. with exceptions for children of foreign diplomats or enemy occupiers.


      Although Wong Kim Ark included children in Indigenous tribes as an additional
      exception, Congress explicitly granted citizenship to them in the 1924 Indian
      Citizenship Act.


      Trump’s executive order says that, beginning on Feb. 19, 2025, children born in
      the U.S. will no longer be treated as citizens if their mothers were not in the
      U.S. lawfully and their fathers were not U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents.


      It also denies citizenship to children whose mothers were legally in the country
      on a temporary basis (such as under the Visa Waiver Program, or with a student,
      tourist, or work visa) and whose fathers were neither citizens nor lawful permanent
      residents.


      The order would deny about 255,000 children nationwide their birthright to citizenship
      each year. It would also effectively cut federal funding for foster care services
      for neglected and abused children, as well as early interventions for infants,
      toddlers, and students who have disabilities.


      On Jan. 21, 22 states sued Trump and some of his department officials in a U.S.
      district court in Massachusetts. The plaintiffs requested a declaration that Trump’s
      order violates the 14th Amendment to the Constitution and U.S. laws, and they
      sought an injunction preventing its enforcement.


      Similar lawsuits were filed in the states of Washington and New Hampshire. In
      all three cases, federal district judges granted injunctions and blocked the operation
      of Trump’s order nationwide while the legal issue worked its way through the courts.


      U.S. District Court Judge John C. Coughenour in the Western District of Washington
      called the executive order “blatantly unconstitutional.” The First, Fourth and
      Ninth Circuit Courts of Appeals affirmed the district courts’ injunctions.


      Thirty days after the Supreme Court’s ruling [on July 26], Trump’s executive order
      could go into effect for people in the 28 states that haven’t challenged it in
      court, unless those individual parents hire their own lawyers to mount their own
      legal challenges.


      ‘Government Likely to Suffer Irreparable Harm’


      In a 6-3 ruling, the radical right-wing majority of the Supreme Court overturned
      the injunctions. They didn’t rule on whether Trump’s executive order was constitutional.
      Instead, they held that federal judges cannot prevent him from implementing it
      on a nationwide basis.


      Amy Coney Barrett, writing for herself, Chief Justice John Roberts, Clarence Thomas,
      Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch, and Brett Kavanaugh, admitted, “No one disputes that
      the Executive has a duty to follow the law.” Nevertheless, the majority held,


      “Nothing like a universal injunction was available at the founding, or for that
      matter, for more than a century thereafter. Thus, under the Judiciary Act, federal
      courts lack authority to issue them.”


      The majority said that


      “… the Government is likely to suffer irreparable harm from the District Courts’
      entry of injunctions that likely exceed the authority conferred by the Judiciary
      Act.”


      Barrett admitted that a “patchwork injunction” would “prove unworkable” because
      “[c]hildren often move across state lines or are born outside their parents’ State
      of residence.” But the majority left it to lower courts to decide whether a “narrower”
      freeze would be “appropriate.”


      The Supreme Court’s ruling anticipated proceedings in the lower courts about how
      much the injunctions should be narrowed for the plaintiffs. The majority suggested
      class-action lawsuits to challenge Trump’s order on behalf of groups of affected
      plaintiffs who were not parties to the three pending cases.


      ‘No Right Is Safe in the New Legal Regime’


      Responding to the new condition for citizenship Trump created in his executive
      order, Sonia Sotomayor wrote in her powerful dissent, in which she was joined
      by Ketanji Brown Jackson and Elena Kagan:


      “Besides birth, there is only one condition: that one be ‘subject to the jurisdiction’
      of the United States. Yet that condition too leaves no room for ambiguity. To
      be ‘subject to the jurisdiction’ of the United States means simply to be bound
      to its authority and its laws.”


      Sotomayor charged that


      “this Court endorses the radical proposition that the President is harmed, irreparably,
      whenever he cannot do something he wants to do, even if what he wants to do is
      break the law.”


      The government “falls well short of satisfying its burden to show that it will
      likely suffer irreparable harm absent a stay and that it will likely succeed on
      the merits of its challenge to the scope of the injunctions,” the dissent says.
      In fact, the notion that the executive branch would be “irreparably harmed by
      injunctions that direct it to continue following settled law,” Sotomayor wrote,
      “strains credulity.”


      Indeed, it is pregnant people whose children would lose the benefits of citizenship
      under Trump’s order who would suffer irreparable harm. The majority, Sotomayor
      wrote, “does not contend otherwise.”


      Sotomayor also noted that the government didn’t ask the Supreme Court to rule
      that Trump’s executive order is constitutional, which would be “an impossible
      task in light of the Constitution’s text, history, this Court’s precedents, federal
      law, and Executive Branch practice.”


      Instead, Sotomayor wrote, the government “tries its hand at a different game.
      It asks this Court to hold that, no matter how illegal a law or policy, courts
      can never simply tell the Executive to stop enforcing it against anyone. … This
      Court’s precedent establishes beyond a shade of doubt that the Executive Order
      is unconstitutional.”


      Sotomayor notes that the majority didn’t identify a single case from the founding
      era to the present in which the Supreme Court held that federal courts can never
      issue “universal injunctions or broad equitable relief that extends to nonparties.”


      “No right is safe in the new legal regime the Court creates,” according to the
      dissent. “Today, the threat is to birthright citizenship. Tomorrow, a different
      administration may try to seize firearms from law-abiding citizens or prevent
      people of certain faiths from gathering to worship.”


      Ruling ‘Existential Threat to the Rule of Law’


      Trump’s effort to abolish universal injunctions “is, at bottom, a request for
      this Court’s permission to engage in unlawful behavior,” Jackson wrote in her
      separate dissent. She calls the majority’s decision “an existential threat to
      the rule of law,” adding, “With deep disillusionment, I dissent.”


      The consequence of the Supreme Court’s ruling is that only children born in the
      U.S. to noncitizen parents who have filed separate lawsuits stand a chance of
      enjoying their constitutional right to birthright citizenship, she noted.


      Jackson said that economic status will determine whether individuals can vindicate
      their constitutional rights going forward. “The wealthy and the well connected
      will have little difficulty securing legal representation, going to court, and
      obtaining injunctive relief in their own name if the Executive violates their
      rights,” she wrote. But


      “the zone of lawlessness the majority has now authorized will disproportionately
      impact the poor, the uneducated, and the unpopular — i.e., those who may not have
      the wherewithal to lawyer up, and will all too often find themselves beholden
      to the Executive’s whims.”


      Ruling Will Lead to ‘Scattershot System’


      In his concurrence, Kavanaugh admits that “the regular movement of the American
      people into and out of different States and regions, would make it difficult to
      sensibly maintain such a scattershot system of federal law.”


      More than 300 lawsuits have been filed to block Trump’s executive orders since
      the beginning of his second term. Federal judges have halted or limited many of
      his actions. But the high court has allowed several of them to continue while
      the legal issues they raise are pending.


      Now separate lawsuits would have to be filed in all 94 federal districts in order
      to challenge the constitutionality of executive orders or federal laws.


      Class-Action Lawsuits


      The Supreme Court suggests that people can file class-action lawsuits in lieu
      of seeking universal injunctions. Class actions allow groups or individual plaintiffs
      to bring a lawsuit on behalf of a larger class of individuals who have been victims
      of similar government policies.


      Kavanaugh cited the possibility of “statewide, regionwide or even nationwide”
      class action relief. But in order to be certified as a class, plaintiffs must
      satisfy several statutory hurdles.


      After the Supreme Court’s ruling, the plaintiffs in two of the three lawsuits
      at issue in this case filed new class-action suits to temporarily block Trump’s
      order from applying to members of the “putative class” of people who would be
      impacted by it. Both suits alleged that the order violates the 14th Amendment
      and the Nationality Act of 1940.


      Casa, Inc.; Asylum Seeker Advocacy Project, Inc.; and expectant and recent mothers
      filed in Maryland for a class action. Plaintiffs proposed a class definition of:


      “All children who have been born or will be born in the United States on or after
      February 19, 2025, who are designated by Executive Order 14,160 to be ineligible
      for birthright citizenship, and their parents.”


      As the plaintiffs wrote:


      “Absent citizenship, children born to noncitizens, including the children of Plaintiffs,
      Members, and members of the putative class, may be subject to deportation. These
      children may therefore be forced to leave the country of their birth to travel
      to a place where they have never been, where they may have no family or legal
      ties, and, in the worst cases, where they may face torture, persecution, and death.”


      In the other case, the national ACLU, ACLU of New Hampshire, ACLU of Maine, ACLU
      of Massachusetts, Legal Defense Fund, Asian Law Caucus and Democracy Defenders
      Fund filed a class-action lawsuit in New Hampshire on behalf of a proposed class
      of babies subject to Trump’s order, as well as their parents. Their proposed class
      includes:


      “All current and future persons who are born on or after February 20, 2025, where
      (1) that person’s mother was unlawfully present in the United States and the person’s
      father was not a United States citizen or lawful permanent resident at the time
      of said person’s birth, or (2) that person’s mother’s presence in the United States
      was lawful but temporary, and the person’s father was not a United States citizen
      or lawful permanent resident at the time of said person’s birth, as well as the
      parents (including expectant parents) of those persons.


      Both lawsuits cited facts showing that they met the numerous requirements for
      class certification, which are set forth in Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 23(a),
      23(b)(2), and 23(g).


      Even if the class is certified and the plaintiffs prevail, other class members
      would not automatically benefit the way they would after a nationwide injunction.
      They would still have to hire a lawyer and prove to the court that they are entitled
      to relief as a class member.


      Project 2025 created a blueprint for Trump’s autocratic state and he has moved
      quickly and decisively to implement it. The Supreme Court granted presidents immunity
      from prosecution for official acts. And the high court has now ruled that federal
      courts are powerless to stop executive branch lawbreaking on a nationwide basis.


      But the resistance will continue to grow as the repression increases. Between
      4 and 6 million people participated in the June 14 “No Kings” protests. People
      are resisting – not only in the courts, but in the media, in Congress, and in
      the streets.

    paragraph_summary: In a recent ruling, the U.S. Supreme Court has limited the authority
      of federal judges to issue universal injunctions against presidential actions,
      effectively prioritizing executive power over judicial oversight. This decision
      arose from a challenge to former President Trump's executive order aimed at restricting
      birthright citizenship for children born in the U.S. to noncitizen parents. The
      Court's 6-3 ruling allows Trump to implement his order while leaving the question
      of its constitutionality unresolved. Dissenting justices expressed concern that
      this ruling undermines the rule of law and disproportionately affects vulnerable
      populations who may lack the resources to challenge government actions individually.
      The implications of this decision could lead to a fragmented legal landscape where
      only those with means can seek justice, raising alarms about the potential erosion
      of constitutional rights.

    text: 'If the definition of citizenship is changed by executive order, there is
      nothing to prevent Trump or any other president from defining citizenship anyway
      they choose, writes Margaret Kimberley.


      By Margaret Kimberly


      Black Agenda Report


      “I‘m just saying if we had the legal right to do it, I would do it in a heartbeat.
      I don’t know if we do or not, we’re looking at that right now.” – Donald Trump
      on sending U.S. citizens convicted of crimes out of the country.


      The idea of citizenship has always been a thorny one for Black people.


      The original United States Constitution allowed the enslaved to be counted for
      purposes of determining congressional representation, but only as three-fifths
      of a person.


      The struggles for liberation during enslavement reached their nadir in the 1857
      Supreme Court case of Dred Scott v. Sandford, in which not only were an enslaved
      man and his family wrongly deprived of their freedom, but Chief Justice Roger
      B. Taney infamously declared that not only were the Scotts not free, but that
      no Black person had any rights “which the white man was bound to respect.”


      A remedy that resolved the issue of Black citizenship was found in the 14th Amendment,
      one of three post-Civil War constitutional amendments that impacted the formerly
      enslaved.


      Ratified in 1868, the 14th Amendment has four clauses, the first of which states,


      “All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction
      thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.”


      The amendment also guarantees due process and equal protection under the law and
      bans those who fought against U.S. government forces in the Civil War from holding
      office because they “engaged in insurrection or rebellion.” The clause pertaining
      to birthright citizenship has been the most contentious source of debate.


      All of the reconstruction era constitutional amendments were either under attack
      from their beginnings or, in the case of the 13th Amendment, harmful by definition.


      The 13th Amendment ended involuntary servitude, “except as a punishment for crime
      whereof the party shall have been duly convicted,” and allows for slave labor
      in U.S. prisons to this day.


      The 15th Amendment guaranteed that “The right of citizens of the United States
      to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on
      account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude.”


      This amendment was undermined immediately after ratification and was not protected
      until 1965 when the Voting Rights Act was passed.


      But, in 2013, the Supreme Court’s decision in the Shelby County v. Holder case
      ended the Act’s preclearance provisions, which provided protection against discriminatory
      practices.


      Trump’s Executive Order


      It is important to remember this history in light of the continued effort by Donald
      Trump’s administration to redefine birthright citizenship and a recent U.S. Supreme
      Court decision regarding the January 2025 Executive Order, “Protecting the Meaning
      and Value of American Citizenship.”


      The order states that the U.S. government will not accept or issue documentation
      proving citizenship to anyone unless one or both parents are citizens or permanent
      residents.


      This change may seem inconsequential until one considers the ways that Black people
      could be deprived of citizenship rights. If there is any group who do not have
      birthright citizenship, then no one has it. Any changes would apply to everyone
      in the country and would permit unknown changes in the future, which could further
      modify the definition of citizenship.


      Should the executive order go into effect, the birth certificate, which guarantees
      citizenship, would guarantee nothing without additional documentation proving
      that the parents were citizens or permanent residents. Such new documentation
      requirements would be easy for some to obtain but difficult for others.


      The situation is further complicated by the fact that states issue these documents,
      not the federal government, and there will inevitably be different rules depending
      upon where births take place.


      Many Black people believe that birthright citizenship should be changed because
      immigrants, even those of short duration in this country, are born with the same
      rights as those whose families have been here for generations.


      Trump himself has said of the 14th Amendment, in his typical inelegant fashion,
      “It was for the slaves.”


      He is correct. The 14th Amendment did undo the 1853 Dred Scott decision, which
      deprived all Black people of citizenship. But Black people must always be wary
      and think ahead, as our enemies may be doing.


      Once any changes to the understanding of birthright citizenship are made, there
      is a possibility of persons, particularly from marginalized groups, becoming stateless.


      There are people who don’t have ready access to birth certificates, or in the
      case of a Black woman in Texas who has a birth certificate listing her name only
      as “Girl” and who, as a result, cannot obtain a Social Security card or prove
      her citizenship. No one knows how many other people find themselves in such situations.


      If the definition of citizenship is changed by executive order, there is nothing
      to prevent Trump or any other president from defining citizenship by whatever
      means they might choose.


      In the case of sending U.S. prisoners out of the country to be incarcerated, there
      is a simple solution to what Trump says he would do, as he put it, in a heartbeat.
      It is possible that he or a future president could declare incarcerated people
      as non-citizens.


      If birth in the U.S. no longer guarantees citizenship, the whims of presidents
      could give and take away. What was once unthinkable could be made possible with
      the stroke of a pen.


      In the immediate aftermath of the executive order, injunctions were filed in federal
      courts, and three of these cases, Trump v. CASA, Trump v. Washington, and Trump
      v. New Jersey, were consolidated into one and were heard before the Supreme Court.


      In a 6 – 3 ruling on June 27, the justices concluded that universal injunctions
      exceed the power of federal courts unless they are necessary to vindicate the
      rights of the parties who filed the lawsuit. As a result, lower courts in each
      of the consolidated cases must determine the proper scope of the injunction issue.


      It is possible that in 30 days, the executive order may go into effect in certain
      parts of the country. Trump’s executive order doesn’t exempt anyone, which means
      that the descendants of the enslaved people that he claims to care so much about
      may not be able to prove citizenship.


      It must be said that Trump’s determination to end birthright citizenship aligns
      with the opinions of many Black people who, for many years, have expressed a desire
      to end birthright citizenship.


      Those views correlated with growing immigration numbers and the prosperity of
      some newcomers, while Black people languished in every data point from income
      to home ownership to educational attainment.


      It is a supreme irony that Trump’s dream of decreasing its non-white immigrant
      population is seen as positive by Black people, although not for the same reasons.


      History and discernment must be the guides. There is little evidence that restricting
      birthright citizenship will keep new immigrant groups from prospering. In fact,
      new procedures carry a high risk of undermining the rights of Black people.


      There may be satisfaction if immigrants aren’t automatically citizens by birth,
      but what will the outcomes be should new procedures and unknown decisions in the
      future undermine a hard fought right for Black people in this country?


      The old saying which warns against cutting off one’s nose in order to spite the
      face, should be kept in mind. The system that has undone so many legal protections
      should not be trusted now.

      noting that the 14th Amendment was a crucial remedy for the injustices faced by
      Black people, especially following the Dred Scott decision. The proposed changes
      in citizenship documentation could create barriers for individuals who may lack
      the necessary proof of their parents' citizenship, leading to a risk of statelessness.

      Hell hath no fury like corporate power scorned, writes Norman Solomon of the general-election
      battle over the next mayor of New York City.


      By Norman Solomon


      Common Dreams


      The Supreme Court’s first chief justice, John Jay, would have empathized with
      the billionaires who’ve been freaking out ever since Zohran Mamdani won the Democratic
      primary for mayor of New York last Tuesday.


      “Those who own the country ought to govern it,” Jay insisted. But now, oligarchs
      accustomed to such governance are furious that the nation’s capital of capitalism
      is in danger of serving people instead of mega-profits.


      Meanwhile, among progressives, euphoria is especially fitting because the Mamdani
      campaign’s win was truly a people-powered victory, thanks to active efforts of
      40,000 volunteers. In a city where registered Democrats outnumber Republicans
      6-to-1, the Democratic nomination would ordinarily be a virtual guarantee of winning
      the general election.


      But the forces of oligarchy now mobilizing could disprove a claim that “Mamdani’s
      widespread appeal represents the total collapse of a Democratic Party establishment.”


      Such a collapse is very far from certain.


      On the surface, former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s decision to stay on the fall
      ballot as an “independent,” while incumbent Mayor Eric Adams does likewise, seems
      to foreshadow splitting the anti-Mamdani vote.


      But Cuomo still has a substantial electoral following. And the corrupt Adams —
      who cut a deal with President Donald Trump to viciously betray immigrants and
      got his criminal indictment thrown out by Trump’s Justice Department — has no
      better ethics than the disgraced former governor Cuomo.


      Bankrolled by wealthy donors, the pair might make some kind of pact, with one
      of them telling his followers to unify behind the other before voting begins this
      fall.


      In any case, a key context of the upcoming election battle is that hell hath no
      fury like corporate power scorned.


      A social-media screed by hedge-fund manager Bill Ackman (net worth: upward of
      $9 billion) was damn near apoplectic that activists and voters had so terribly
      transgressed.


      Ackman described himself as “a supporter of President Trump” while expressing
      a fervent desire “to save the Democratic Party from itself.” Mamdani’s policies,
      Ackman wrote late Wednesday night, “would be disastrous for NYC. Socialism has
      no place in the economic capital of our country.”


      But Ackman held out hope that those owning the city of New York could continue
      to govern it:


      “Importantly, there are hundreds of million of dollars of capital available to
      back a competitor to Mamdani that can be put together overnight… so that a great
      alternative candidate won’t spend any time raising funds. So, if the right candidate
      would raise his or her hand tomorrow, the funds will pour in. I am sure that Mike
      Bloomberg will share his how-to-win-the-mayoralty IP [intellectual property] and
      deliver his entire election apparatus and system to the aspiring candidate so
      that the candidate can focus all of his or her energy on the campaign.”


      Another aggrieved hedge-fund multibillionaire, Daniel Loeb, opted to be concise:
      “It’s officially hot commie summer.”


      Alan Dershowitz says NY Post called him and asked if he’d run for mayor to stop
      Mamdani. “An 87-year-old running against the 33-year-old, I don’t like the odds.”
      He says he’ll “contribute maximum amount of money to any candidate who can defeat”
      him and challenges ZM to debate. pic.twitter.com/r60wMGUJtB — Jacob N. Kornbluh

      Many other moguls have also sounded alarms. But beneath all the froth and bombast,
      extremely wealthy individuals are busy gauging how to prevail against the threat
      of democracy and social justice.


      In the Empire State, there are many ways for the empire to strike back. The constellation
      of forces now regrouping with a vengeance includes titans of Wall Street, enormous
      real estate interests, pro-Israel groups, corporate media, the anti-progressive
      rich and assorted smear artists.


      In recent weeks, the completely false charge of antisemitism has escalated against
      Mamdani. He has taken a principled and consistent stand on behalf of human rights
      for all — in the process, denouncing Israel’s war on Palestinian civilians in
      Gaza — while at the same time opposing rapacious corporate power.


      So, it’s no surprise that New York’s most powerful Democrat, Sen. Minority Leader
      Chuck Schumer, has been dodging the question of whether he’ll endorse Mamdani
      in the general election.


      For decades, Schumer’s campaign coffers have bulged while he has been hugely compensated
      by Wall Street. He has also remained a staunch supporter of Israel, despite its
      systematic ethnic cleaning and genocide against Palestinian people. A few months
      ago, Schumer declared: “My job is to keep the left pro-Israel.”


      What happened in the state’s second-largest city in 2021 is important to understand.
      Democratic socialist India Walton was the candidate of a grassroots campaign that
      stunned the party establishment in the Democratic primary when she defeated Buffalo’s
      corporate mayor, four-term incumbent Byron Brown.


      As the Democratic nominee, she seemed set to win the general election in the blue
      city. But a coalition of furious Democratic power brokers and deep-pocketed Republicans,
      including racists and vehement haters of the left, aided by much of the city’s
      mass media, teamed up to smear her and ending up getting Brown elected as a write-in
      candidate.


      Last weekend, I asked India (now a colleague at RootsAction, where she is senior
      strategist) how she saw the Mamdani campaign. “Watching the New York City mayoral
      primary from Buffalo last Tuesday gave me a familiar feeling,” she said.


      “As I watched the results come in, I felt a flutter in my gut and a sense of pensiveness.
      A feeling of overwhelming joy and a fear that it would be snatched away despite
      my attempts to cling to it. I imagine that as Zohran watched, he also felt a sense
      of familiarity. In 2021, Zohran Mamdani supported my run for Buffalo mayor; I
      was a first-time unknown candidate challenging a 16-year incumbent, and conventional
      wisdom said it was an impossible race to win. Now, in 2025, Zohran has once again
      toppled the establishment. I’m starting to think that populist policies that focus
      on working people are a winning strategy.”


      That strategy is now striking fear into the hard hearts of insatiably greedy billionaires.


      Norman Solomon is the national director of RootsAction.org and executive director
      of the Institute for Public Accuracy. His new book, War Made Invisible: How America
      Hides the Human Toll of Its Military Machine, was published in June 2023 by The
      New Press.

      In her latest report, Special Rapporteur Francesca Albanese demands that more
      than 1,000 corporate entities sever ties with Israel or be held accountable for
      complicity in war crimes.


      By Chris Hedges


      ScheerPost


      War is a business. So is genocide.


      The latest report submitted by Francesca Albanese, special rapporteur on the Occupied
      Palestinian Territories, lists 48 corporations and institutions, including Palantir
      Technologies Inc., Lockheed Martin, Alphabet Inc., Amazon, International Business
      Machine Corporation (IBM), Caterpillar Inc., Microsoft Corporation and Massachusetts
      Institue of Technology (MIT), along with banks and financial firms such as Blackrock,
      insurers, real estate firms and charities, which in violation of international
      law are making billions from the occupation and the genocide of Palestinians.


      The report, which includes a database of over 1,000 corporate entities that collaborate
      with Israel, demands these firms and institutions sever ties with Israel or be
      held accountable for complicity in war crimes.


      It describes Israel’s “forever-occuption” as “the ideal testing ground for arms
      manufacturers and Big Tech — providing significant supply and demand, little oversight,
      and zero accountability — while investors and private and public institutions
      profit freely.”


      The post-Holocaust industrialists’ trials and the South African Truth and Reconciliation
      Commission laid the legal framework for recognizing the criminal responsibility
      of institutions and businesses that participate in international crimes.


      This new report makes clear that decisions made by the International Court of
      Justice place an obligation on entities “to not engage and/or to withdraw totally
      and unconditionally from any associated dealings, and to ensure that any engagement
      with Palestinians enables their self-determination.”


      “The genocide in Gaza has not stopped because it’s lucrative, it’s profitable
      for far too many,” Albanese told me.


      “It’s a business. There are corporate entities, including from Palestine-friendly
      states, who have for decades made businesses and made profits out of the economy
      of the occupation. Israel has always exploited Palestinian land, resources and
      Palestinian life. The profits have continued and even increased as the economy
      of the occupation transformed into an economy of genocide.”


      In addition, she said, Palestinians have provided


      “boundless training fields to test the technologies, test weapons, to test surveillance
      techniques that now are being used against people everywhere from the Global South
      to the Global North.”


      You can see my interview with Albanese here.


      US Calls for Albanese’s Head


      [The Times of Israel reported Wednesday, a day after Albanese’s report was issued,
      that the United States had urged the United Nations in a letter to the secretary
      general to sack Albanese on the absurd allegation of “virulent antisemitism and
      support for terrorism.”


      The U.S. accused her of “an unacceptable campaign of political and economic warfare
      against the American and worldwide economy.” The World Jewish Congress also blasted
      her report, calling it a “deeply biased narrative.”


      “Ms. Albanese’s report is yet another example of her repeated misuse of her mandate
      to advance a political agenda rather than to uphold the universal principles of
      human rights,” WJC Executive Vice President Maram Stern said in a statement.]


      A Captive Market


      Albanese’s report lambasts corporations for “providing Israel with the weapons
      and machinery required to destroy homes, schools, hospitals, places of leisure
      and worship, livelihoods and productive assets, such as olive groves and orchards.”


      The Palestinian territory, the report notes, is a “captive market” because of
      Israeli-imposed restrictions on trade and investment, tree planting, fishing and
      water for colonies. Corporations have profiteered from this “captive market” by
      “exploiting Palestinian labour and resources, degrading and diverting natural
      resources, building and powering colonies and selling and marketing derived goods
      and services in Israel, the occupied Palestinian territory and globally.”


      “Israel gains from this exploitation, while it costs the Palestinian economy at
      least 35 per cent of its GDP,” the report notes.


      Banks, asset management firms, pension funds and insurers have “channeled finance
      into the illegal occupation,” the report charges. In addition, “universities —
      centres of intellectual growth and power — have sustained the political ideology
      underpinning the colonization of Palestinian land, developed weaponry and overlooked
      or even endorsed systemic violence, while global research collaborations have
      obscured Palestinian erasure behind a veil of academic neutrality.”


      Surveillance and incarceration technologies have “evolved into tools for indiscriminate
      targeting of the Palestinian population,” the report notes.


      “Heavy machinery previously used for house demolitions, infrastructure destruction
      and resource seizure in the West Bank have been repurposed to obliterate the urban
      landscape of Gaza, preventing displaced populations from returning and reconstituting
      as a community.”


      A Testing Ground


      The military assault on the Palestinians has also “provided testing grounds for
      cutting-edge military capabilities: air defense platforms, drones, targeting tools
      powered by artificial intelligence and even the F-35 programme led by the United
      States of America. These technologies are then marketed as ‘battle proven.’”


      Since 2020, Israel has been the eighth largest arms exporter in the world. Its
      two biggest weapons companies are Elbit Systems Ltd and the state-owned Israel
      Aerospace Industries Ltd (IAI). It has a series of international partnerships
      with foreign weapons firms, including “for the F-35 fighter jet, led by United
      States-based Lockheed Martin.”


      “Components and parts constructed globally contribute to the Israeli F-35 fleet,
      which Israel customizes and maintains in partnership with Lockheed Martin and
      domestic companies,” the report reads. Since October 2023, F-35s and F-16s jets
      have been


      “integral to equipping Israel with the unprecedented aerial power to drop an estimated
      85,000 tons of bombs, much of it unguided, to kill and injure more than 179,411
      Palestinians and obliterate Gaza.”


      “Drones, hexacopters and quadcopters have also been omnipresent killing machines
      in the skies of Gaza,” the report reads.


      “Drones largely developed and supplied by Elbit Systems and Israel Aerospace Industries
      have long flown alongside fighter jets, surveilling Palestinians and delivering
      target intelligence. In the past two decades, with support from these companies
      and collaborations with institutions such as the Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
      drones used by Israel acquired automated weapons systems and the ability to fly
      in swarm formation.”


      Japan’s FANUC companies sell automation products and “provide robotic machinery
      for weapons production lines, including for IAI, Elbit Systems and Lockheed Martin.”


      “Shipping companies such as the Danish A.P. Moller — Maersk A/S transport components,
      parts, weapons and raw materials, sustaining a steady flow of United States-supplied
      military equipment post-October 2023.”


      There was a “65 per cent surge in Israeli military spending from 2023 to 2024
      – amounting to $46.5 billion, one of the highest per capita worldwide.” This “generated
      a sharp surge in their annual profits,” while “Foreign arms companies, especially
      producers of munitions and ordnance, also profit.”


      Surveillance Technology


      At the same time, tech companies have profited from the genocide by “providing
      dual-use infrastructure to integrate mass data collection and surveillance, while
      profiting from the unique testing ground for military technology offered by the
      occupied Palestinian territory.”


      They enhance “carceral and surveillance services, from closed-circuit television
      (CCTV) networks, biometric surveillance, advanced tech checkpoint networks, ‘smart
      walls’ and drone surveillance, to cloud computing, artificial intelligence and
      data analytics supporting on-the-ground military personnel.”


      “Israeli tech firms often grow out of military infrastructure and strategy,” the
      report reads,


      “as the NSO Group, founded by ex-Unit 8200 members, did. Its Pegasus spyware,
      designed for covert smartphone surveillance, has been used against Palestinian
      activists and licensed globally to target leaders, journalists and human rights
      defenders. Exported under the Defense Export Control Law, NSO group surveillance
      technology enables ‘spyware diplomacy’ while reinforcing State impunity.”


      IBM, whose technology facilitated Nazi Germany’s generation and tabulation of
      punched cards for national census data, military logistics, ghetto statistics,
      train traffic management and concentration camp capacity, is once again a partner
      in this current genocide.


      It has operated in Israel since 1972. It provides training for Israeli military
      and intelligence agencies, especially Unit 8200, which is responsible for clandestine
      operations, the collection of signal intelligence and code decryption, along with
      counterintelligence, cyberwarfare, military intelligence and surveillance.


      “Since 2019, IBM Israel has operated and upgraded the central database of the
      Population and Immigration Authority, enabling collection, storage and governmental
      use of biometric data on Palestinians, and supporting the discriminatory permit
      regime of Israel,” the report notes.


      Microsoft, active in Israel since 1989, is “embedded in the prison service, police,
      universities and schools — including in colonies. Microsoft has been integrating
      its systems and civilian tech across the Israeli military since 2003, while acquiring
      Israeli cybersecurity and surveillance start-ups.”


      “As Israeli apartheid, military and population-control systems generate increasing
      volumes of data, its reliance on cloud storage and computing has grown,” the report
      reads.


      “In 2021, Israel awarded Alphabet Inc. (Google) and Amazon.com, Inc. a $1.2 billion
      contract (Project Nimbus) — largely funded through Ministry of Defense expenditure
      — to provide core tech infrastructure.”


      Microsoft, Alphabet Inc., and Amazon “grant Israel virtually government-wide access
      to their cloud and artificial intelligence technologies, enhancing data processing,
      decision-making and surveillance and analysis capacities.”


      The Israeli military, the report points out,


      “has developed artificial intelligence systems such as ‘Lavender,’ ‘Gospel’ and
      ‘Where’s Daddy?’ to process data and generate lists of targets, reshaping modern
      warfare and illustrating the dual-use nature of artificial intelligence.”


      There are “reasonable grounds,” the report reads, to believe that Palantir Technology
      Inc., which has a long relationship with Israel,


      “has provided automatic predictive policing technology, core defence infrastructure
      for rapid and scaled-up construction and deployment of military software, and
      its Artificial Intelligence Platform, which allows real-time battlefield data
      integration for automated decision-making.”


      Palantir’s CEO in April 2025 responded to accusations that Palantir kills Palestinians
      in Gaza by saying, “mostly terrorists, that’s true.”


      Heavy Machinery


      “Civilian technologies have long served as dual-use tools of settler-colonial
      occupation,” the report reads. “Israeli military operations rely heavily on equipment
      from leading global manufacturers to ‘unground’ Palestinians from their land,
      demolishing homes, public buildings, farmland, roads and other vital infrastructure.
      Since October 2023, this machinery has been integral to damaging and destroying
      70 per cent of structures and 81 per cent of cropland in Gaza.”


      Caterpillar Inc. has for decades provided the Israeli military with equipment
      used to demolish Palestinian homes, mosques, hospitals as well as “burying alive
      wounded Palestinians,” and killed activists, such as Rachel Corrie.


      “Israel has evolved Caterpillar’s D9 bulldozer into automated, remote-commanded
      core weaponry of the Israeli military, deployed in almost every military activity
      since 2000, clearing incursion lines, ‘neutralizing’ the territory and killing
      Palestinians,” the report reads.


      This year, Caterpillar “secured a further multi-millionaire dollar contract with
      Israel.”


      “The Korean HD Hyundai and its partially-owned subsidiary, Doosan, alongside the
      Swedish Volvo Group and other major heavy machinery manufacturers, have long been
      linked to destruction of Palestinian property, each supplying equipment through
      exclusively licensed Israeli dealers,” the report reads.


      “As corporate actors have contributed to the destruction of Palestinian life in
      the occupied Palestinian territory, they have also helped construction of what
      replaces it: building colonies and their infrastructure, extracting and trading
      materials, energy and agricultural products, and bringing visitors to colonies
      as if to a regular holiday destination.”


      “More than 371 colonies and illegal outposts have been built, powered and traded
      with by companies facilitating the replacement by Israel of the Indigenous population
      in the occupied Palestinian territory,” the report concludes.


      These building projects have used Caterpillar, HD Hyundai and Volvo excavators
      and heavy equipment. Hanson Israel, a subsidiary of the German Heidelberg Materials
      AG, “has contributed to the pillage of millions of tons of dolomite rock from
      the Nahal Raba quarry on land seized from Palestinian villages in the West Bank.”


      The quarried dolomite is used to construct Jewish colonies in the West Bank.


      Foreign firms have also “contributed to developing roads and public transport
      infrastructure critical to establishing and expanding the colonies, and connecting
      them to Israel while excluding and segregating Palestinians.”


      Real Estate


      Global real estate companies sell properties in colonial settlements to Israeli
      and international buyers. These real estate firms include Keller Williams Realty
      LLC, which has “had branches based in the colonies” through its Israeli franchisee
      KW Israel.


      Last year through another franchisee called Home in Israel, Keller Williams “ran
      a real estate roadshow in Canada and the United States, jointly sponsored with
      several companies developing and marketing thousands of apartments in colonies.”


      Rental platforms, including Booking.com and Airbnb, list properties and hotel
      rooms in illegal Jewish colonies in the West Bank.


      Chinese Bright Dairy & Food is a majority owner of Tnuva, Israel’s largest food
      conglomerate, which utilizes land seized from Palestinians in the West Bank.


      Energy Companies


      In the energy sector,


      “Chevron Corporation, in consortium with Israeli NewMedEnergy (a subsidiary of
      the OHCHR database-listed Delek Group), extracts natural gas from the Leviathan
      and Tamar fields; it paid the government of Israel $453 million in royalties and
      taxes in 2023. Chevron’s consortium supplies more than 70 percent of Israeli energy
      consumption. Chevron also profits from its part-ownership of the East Mediterranean
      Gas pipeline, which passes through Palestinian maritime territory, and from gas
      export sales to Egypt and Jordan.”


      BP and Chevron also serve as


      “the largest contributors to Israeli imports of crude oil, as major owners of
      the strategic Azeri Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline and the Kazakh Caspian Pipeline
      Consortium, respectively, and of their associated oil fields. Each conglomerate
      effectively supplied 8 per cent of Israeli crude oil between October 2023 and
      July 2024, supplemented by crude oil shipments from Brazilian oil fields, in which
      Petrobras holds the largest stakes, and military jet fuel. Oil from these companies
      supplies two refineries in Israel.”


      “By supplying Israel with coal, gas, oil and fuel, companies are contributing
      to civilian infrastructures that Israel uses to entrench permanent annexation
      and now weaponizes in the destruction of Palestinian life in Gaza,” the report
      reads. “The same infrastructure that these companies supply resources into has
      serviced the Israeli military and its energy-intensive tech-driven obliteration
      of Gaza. ”


      Banks


      International banks and financial firms have also sustained the genocide through
      the purchase of Israeli treasury bonds.


      “As the main source of finance for the Israeli State budget, treasury bonds have
      played a critical role in funding the ongoing assault on Gaza,” the report reads.


      “From 2022 to 2024, the Israeli military budget grew from 4.2 per cent to 8.3
      per cent of GDP, driving the public budget into a 6.8 per cent deficit. Israel
      funded this ballooning budget by increasing its bond issuance, including $8 billion
      in March 2024 and $5 billion in February 2025, alongside issuances on its domestic
      new shekel market.”


      The report notes that some of the world’s largest banks, including BNP Paribas
      and Barclays,


      “stepped in to boost market confidence by underwriting these international and
      domestic treasury bonds, allowing Israel to contain the interest rate premium,
      despite a credit downgrade. Asset management firms — including Blackrock ($68
      million), Vanguard ($546 million) and Allianz’s asset management subsidiary PIMCO
      ($960 million) — were among at least 400 investors from 36 countries who purchased
      them.”


      Charities


      Faith-based charities have “also become key financial enablers of illegal projects,
      including in the occupied Palestinian territory, often receiving tax deductions
      abroad despite strict regulatory charitable frameworks,” the report reads.


      “The Jewish National Fund (KKL-JNF) and its over 20 affiliates fund settler expansion
      and military-linked projects,” the report reads.


      “Since October 2023, platforms such as Israel Gives have enabled tax-deductible
      crowdfunding in 32 countries for Israeli military units and settlers. The United
      States-based Christian Friends of Israeli Communities, Dutch Christians for Israel
      and global affiliates, sent over $12.25 million in 2023 to various projects that
      support colonies, including some that train extremist settlers.”


      Universities


      The report criticizes universities that partner with Israeli universities and
      institutions. It notes that labs at MIT “conduct weapons and surveillance research
      funded by the Israeli Ministry of Defense.” These projects include “drone swarm
      control — a distinct feature of the Israeli assault on Gaza since October 2023
      — pursuit algorithms, and underwater surveillance.”


      You can see my interview with the MIT students who exposed the collaboration between
      the university Israeli military here.


      Genocide requires a vast network and billions of dollars to sustain it. Israel
      could not carry out its mass slaughter of the Palestinians without this ecosystem.


      These entities, which profit from industrial violence against the Palestinians
      and mass displacement, are as guilty of genocide as the Israeli military units
      decimating the people in Gaza.


      They too are war criminals. They too must be held accountable.

    url: https://consortiumnews.com/2025/07/02/britains-long-history-of-spying-on-iran/
    text: 'The U.K. has spent decades trying to subvert Iran’s government, but also
      secretly sold them chemical weapons and spied on opposition activists, reports
      Martin Williams.


      By Martin Williams


      Declassified UK


      As bombs fell on Iran last month, the U.K. government claimed it had “not participated”
      in the military action led by Israel and the U.S.


      But British spy agencies have a long history of meddling in Iran, with everything
      from covert influence operations, to secretly selling chemical weapons materials
      to the regime.


      In one case, the U.K. spy agency Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ)
      even created a network of fake Twitter accounts to secretly monitor Iranian opposition
      activists – the very people working to remove supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei
      from power.


      Coup


      British spies have targeted Iran for decades, driven by commercial profit and
      regional control.


      In 1951, when the country’s secular prime minister, Mohammed Mosaddeq, nationalised
      the British Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (later known as BP), the British ambassador
      wrote: “It is so important to prevent the Persians from destroying their main
      source of revenue … by trying to run it themselves.”


      Two years later, the U.K. and U.S. secretly backed a coup to oust Mosaddeq and
      centralise power under a repressive “pro-Western” regime.


      Declassified files have since revealed the central role played by MI6, which recruited
      agents and bribed members of Iran’s Parliament. In doing so, one former spy claimed
      they spent “well over a million and a half pounds”.


      The U.K. and U.S. then supported Iran’s dictator, the shah, for the next 25 years.


      By 1979, the Iranian Revolution saw the establishment of the Islamic Republic
      led by another dictator, Ayatollah Khomeini. But this did not stop British spies
      from collaborating with the regime when it was in their interests.


      For instance, in 1983, British intelligence provided Khomeini with a list of Iranians
      allegedly working for the Soviet Union. The intelligence was used to round up
      over 1,000 communists, as many as 200 of whom were executed. Meanwhile Iran’s
      communist party, the Tudeh, was banned and forced underground.


      Secret relations were again exploited in the early 1990s, when MI6 helped supply
      Iran with materials to make chemical weapons — despite its own ban on such sales.


      Britain’s aim was supposedly to use the deals as a way to insert operatives into
      the Iranian government and gather intelligence about its weapons programmes.


      Cyber Warfare


      Under Tony Blair’s premiership, phone hacking and cyber warfare became an ever-more
      important part of U.K. spy operations against Iran.


      From around 2005, Israel and America worked together to develop the notorious
      Stuxnet computer virus attack, which has been described as “the world’s first
      digital weapon”.


      It was used against Iran’s nuclear facilities four years later, and reports have
      claimed British intelligence agencies played a role.


      And in 2007, GCHQ intercepted telephone conversations that proved Iran had stopped
      work on its nuclear weapons programme four years earlier.


      Despite his government being the victim of espionage, Iranian president Mahmoud
      Ahmadinejad actually celebrated the disclosure, saying it had left the west “empty
      handed” following the “lies of nuclear weapons”.


      It also triggered a re-evaluation of US policy towards Iran, although George W.
      Bush – who was president at the time – continued to warn about the threat posed
      by Tehran. “What’s to say they couldn’t start another covert nuclear weapons programme,”
      he told reporters.


      JTRIG


      Perhaps the U.K.’s most audacious and troubling operations of this era were run
      by a specialist GCHQ unit called the Joint Threat Research Intelligence Group
      (JTRIG).


      Documents leaked by Edward Snowden show how JTRIG targeted the “general population”
      of Iran between at least 2009 and 2011.


      Its work included “discrediting the Iranian leadership and its nuclear programme”,
      causing disruption to the nuclear programme, conducting human intelligence operations
      online, and counter-censorship campaigns.


      A report from 2011 explains: “JTRIG staff use a range of techniques to, for example,
      discredit, disrupt, delay, deny, degrade, and deter.


      “The techniques include: uploading YouTube videos containing persuasive messages;
      establishing online aliases with Facebook and Twitter accounts, blogs and forum
      memberships for conducting HUMINT [human intelligence] or encouraging discussion
      on specific issues; sending spoof emails and text messages as well as providing
      spoof online resources; and setting up spoof trade sites.”


      Lurl.me


      Another leaked document, published by NBC News in 2014, shows how JTRIG tracked
      down the location of targets using a URL-shortening service they made specially,
      called lurl.me.


      This allowed spies to send innocent-looking web links to individuals, and ultimately
      gain access to their IP address, emails and social media.


      Incredibly, JTRIG’s use of lurl.me can still be found online today. The links
      were posted by a network of fake Twitter bots which became active around the 2009
      Iranian presidential election.


      But rather than targeting Khamenei’s repressive regime, the tweets are aimed at
      anti-government activists. They call for a revolution and provide links to internet
      proxies, western news outlets and websites blocked by the Iranian government.


      It appears that JTRIG was trying to encourage dissent while also secretly monitoring
      the dissenters.


      Around the same time, the unit also had access to a vast catalogue of other cyber
      warfare tools — although it is not known which were used against Iranian targets.


      The tools covered everything from online honeytraps and spoofing email addresses,
      to changing the outcome of online polls and amplifying messages on YouTube.


      British spy operations like these were not done in isolation. Documents from 2013,
      published by WikiLeaks, revealed how GCHQ “long advocated that it work with NSA
      and the Israeli SIGINT Service (ISNU) in a trilateral arrangement in prosecuting
      the Iranian target.”


      ‘Palestinians’


      Other documents make clear that “Palestinians” were one of the “specific intelligence
      topics” that are shared between GCHQ agents and their counterparts in America
      and Israel.


      The document adds that, due to the “sensitivities” of Israeli involvement, the
      programme does not include direct targeting of Palestinians themselves.


      By 2012, the then head of MI6, Sir John Sawers, boasted that Iran had been prevented
      from developing nuclear weapons thanks to covert operations by British spies.


      Sawers admitted that MI6 had “run a series of operations to ensure that the sanctions
      introduced internationally are implemented, and that we do everything we can within
      the Middle East to slow down these remaining problems”.


      But leaked emails show that officials within the Obama administration reacted
      with dismay when Sawers’ comments were made public.


      Hilary Clinton, who was then secretary of state, replied: “Gobsmacking!”, while
      one of her officials described the disclosure as “most unfortunate on many levels
      to say the least”.'
    one_sentence_summary: The U.K. has a long history of covertly interfering in Iran's
      government, including selling chemical weapons, spying on opposition activists,
      and conducting cyber operations, all while publicly denying involvement in military
      actions against the country.

      both attempts to undermine its government and secret dealings, including the sale
      of chemical weapons materials. British intelligence agencies, particularly MI6

      to remove the democratically elected prime minister Mohammed Mosaddeq, supporting
      the shah's regime, and later collaborating with the Islamic Republic for intelligence
      purposes. Notably, GCHQ's Joint Threat Research Intelligence Group (JTRIG) employed
      cyber warfare tactics and social media manipulation to monitor and disrupt Iranian
      opposition movements. Despite publicly distancing itself from military actions
      against Iran, the U.K. has been deeply involved in espionage and influence operations
      aimed at controlling Iran's political landscape and nuclear ambitions, often in
      collaboration with U.S. and Israeli intelligence.

      Iran is capable of building a nuclear weapon in days if the political decision
      is made, the author wrote in CN last October. He maintains that view after the
      U.S. and Israeli strikes on three nuclear facilities last month.


      Scott Ritter, the former U.N. weapons inspector, wrote the following article for
      Consortium News last October, in which he says that following the first missile
      exchange that month, Iranian officials made it clear that the fatwa against nuclear
      weapons could be lifted; that Iran was prepared to obtain a nuclear weapon; that
      it had the means to do so and that the decision could be implemented in days once
      the Supreme Leader gave the order.


      Following the more intense 12-day war in June, Ritter told Consortium News‘ CN
      Live! and Judge Andrew Napolitano’s Judging Freedom that Iran could still be days
      away if a decision is made to build a bomb. There was no damage done to the facility
      at Isfahan, where Ritter told Napolitano 90 percent enriched uranium could be
      converted into metal, an important step in the bomb-making process.


      The IAEA says it does not know where 400 kilograms of 60 percent enriched uranium
      was removed to from the Fordow enrichment plant, which was damaged by U.S. bombing.
      Ritter says enriching that to 90 percent can be done quickly. There is still no
      indication that Iran has decided to initiate this process.


      The IAEA director general said on June 18 that there is “no proof of a systematic
      effort” by Iran to develop nuclear weapons. U.S. intelligence estimates say the
      same.


      Ritter says Iran eventually enriched to 60 percent as a bargaining chip with the
      U.S. after Donald Trump foolishly pulled the U.S. out of the Iran nuclear deal,
      which was working to maintain Iran at 3.67 percent enrichment.


      But he says the move was an unwise waving of a red flag before an aggressive U.S.
      and Israel.


      Here is the updated version of Ritter’s October 2024 Consortium News article.


      By Scott Ritter


      Special to Consortium News


      October 20, 2024


      The outbreak of conflict between Iran and Israel [in October 2024] appears to
      have changed Iran’s stance against possessing a nuclear weapon as Israel is poised
      to strike after Teheran’s retaliation with two major attacks of drones and ballistic
      and cruise missiles.


      Iran has issued at least three statements through official channels since April
      that has opened the door to the possibility of religious edicts against Iran acquiring
      nuclear weapons being rescinded.


      The circumstances which Iran has said must exist to justify this reversal appear
      to have now been met.


      No mere threats, these statements issued by Teheran should be viewed as declaratory
      policy indicating Iran has already made the decision to obtain a nuclear weapon;
      that the means to do so are already in place and that this decision can be implemented
      in a matter of days once the final political order is given.


      The religious fatwa against possessing nuclear weapons was issued in October 2003
      by Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. It reads:


      “We believe that adding to nuclear weapons and other types of weapons of mass
      destruction, such as chemical weapons and biological weapons, are a serious threat
      to humanity…[w]e consider the use of these weapons to be haram (forbidden), and
      the effort to protect mankind from this great disaster is everyone’s duty.”


      However, the Shia faith holds that fatwas are not inherently permanent, and Islamic
      jurists can reinterpret the scripture in accord with the needs of time.


      Shortly after Iran launched Operation True Promise against Israel in April, Ahmad
      Haghtalab, an Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) commander responsible for
      the security for Iran’s nuclear sites, declared:


      “If [Israel] wants to exploit the threat of attacking our country’s nuclear centers
      as a tool to put pressure on Iran, it is possible and conceivable to revise the
      Islamic Republic of Iran’s nuclear doctrine and policies to deviate from previously
      declared considerations.”


      In May, Kamal Kharrazi, a former foreign minister who advises the Supreme Leader,
      declared: “We [Iran] have no decision to build a nuclear bomb, but should Iran’s
      existence be threatened, there will be no choice but to change our military doctrine.”


      And earlier this month Iranian lawmakers called for a review of Iran’s defense
      doctrine to consider adopting nuclear weapons as the risk of escalation with Israel
      continues to grow. The legislators noted that the Supreme Leader can reconsider
      the fatwa against nuclear weapons on the grounds that the circumstances have changed.


      These statements, seen together, constitute a form of declaratory policy which,
      given the sources involved, imply that a political decision has already been made
      to build a nuclear bomb once the national security criterion has been met.


      Has the Capability


      Iran has for some time now possessed the ability to manufacture and weaponize
      nuclear explosive devices. Using highly enriched uranium, Iran could construct
      in a matter of days a simple gun-type weapon that could be used in a ballistic
      missile warhead.


      In June Iran informed the IAEA that it was installing some 1,400 advanced centrifuges
      at its Fordow facility. Based upon calculations derived from Iran’s on-hand stockpile
      of 60 percent enriched uranium hexaflouride (the feedstock used in centrifuge-based
      enrichment), Iran could produce enough highly enriched uranium (i.e., above 90
      percent) to manufacture 3-5 uranium-based weapons in days.


      All that is needed is the political will to do so. It appears that Iran has crossed
      this threshold, meaning that the calculus behind any Israeli and/or U.S. attack
      on Iran has been forever changed.


      Iran has made no bones about this new reality. In February, the former chief of
      the Atomic Energy Organization, Ali-Akbar Salehi, stated that Iran has crossed
      “all the scientific and technological nuclear thresholds” to build a nuclear bomb,
      noting that Iran had accumulated all the necessary components for a nuclear weapon,
      minus the highly enriched uranium.

      Two weeks later, Javad Karimi Ghodousi, a member of the Iranian parliament’s National
      Security Commission, declared that if the supreme leader “issues permission, we
      would be a week away from testing the first [nuclear bomb]“, later adding that
      Iran “needs half a day or maximum a week to build a nuclear warhead.”


      A simple gun-type nuclear weapon would not need to be tested — the “Little Boy“
      device dropped on Hiroshima by the U.S. on Aug. 6, 1945 was a gun-type device
      that was deemed so reliable that it could be used operationally without any prior
      testing.


      Iran would need between 75 and 120 pounds of highly enriched uranium per gun-type
      device (the more sophisticated the design, the less material would be needed).
      Regardless, the payload of the Fatah-1 solid-fueled hypersonic missile, which
      was used in the Oct. 1 attack on Israel, is some 900 pounds—more than enough capacity
      to carry a gun-type uranium weapon.


      Given the fact that the ballistic missile shield covering Israel was unable to
      intercept the Fatah-1 missile, if Iran were to build, deploy, and employ a nuclear-armed
      Fatah-1 missile against Israel, there is a near 100 percent certainty that it
      would hit its target.


      Iran would need 3-5 nuclear weapons of this type to completely destroy Israel’s
      ability to function as a modern industrial nation.


      Consequences of Pulling Out of Iran Nuclear Deal


      This situation came about after President Donald Trump in 2017 withdrew the U.S.
      from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action — the JCPOA, better known as the Iran
      nuclear deal. The driving factor behind the negotiation of the JCPOA, which took
      place under President Barack Obama, was to shut down Iran’s pathway to a nuclear
      weapon. As Obama said,


      “Put simply, under this deal, there is a permanent prohibition on Iran ever having
      a nuclear weapons program and a permanent inspections regime that goes beyond
      any previous inspection regime in Iran. This deal provides the IAEA the means
      to make sure Iran isn’t doing so, both through JCPOA-specific verification tools,
      some of which last up to 25 years, and through the Additional Protocol that lasts
      indefinitely. In addition, Iran made commitments in this deal that include prohibitions
      on key research and development activities that it would need to design and construct
      a nuclear weapon. Those commitments have no end date.”


      Early on in his administration, in June 2021, after Trump had already pulled the
      U.S. out of the deal, President Joe Biden declared that Iran would “never get
      a nuclear weapon on my watch.”


      The director of U.S. National Intelligence said in a statement released Oct. 11
      that, “We assess that the Supreme Leader has not made a decision to resume the
      nuclear weapons program that Iran suspended in 2003.”


      In the aftermath of Trump’s precipitous decision to withdraw from the JCPOA, Iran
      took actions which underscored that it no longer felt constrained by any JCPOA
      limits.


      Iran has expanded its nuclear program by installing advanced centrifuge cascades
      used to enrich uranium and scaled back International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)
      monitoring of its nuclear program. In short, Iran has positioned itself to produce
      a nuclear weapon on short order.


      While the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) currently believes
      that the Supreme Leader has not made the political decision to do so, an assessment
      published in July contains a telling omission from past assessments of Iran’s
      nuclear capabilities.


      The February 2024 ODNI assessment noted that, “Iran is not currently undertaking
      the key nuclear weapons-development activities necessary to produce a testable
      nuclear device.”


      However, this statement went missing from the July 2024 assessment, a clear indication
      that the U.S. intelligence community, due in large part to the reduction in IAEA
      inspection activity, lacks the insight into critical technical aspects of Iran’s
      nuclear-related industries.


      Senator Lindsey Graham, after reading the classified version of the July 2024
      ODNI report on Iran, said he was “very worried” that “Iran will in the coming
      weeks or months possess a nuclear weapon.”


      Iran indicated that any attack against its nuclear or oil and gas production capabilities
      would be viewed as existential in nature. That could trigger the reversal of the
      fatwa and the deployment of nuclear weapons within days of such a decision being
      made.


      The United States and nuclear-power Israel have long said that a nuclear-armed
      Iran was a red line which could not be crossed without severe consequences, namely
      massive military intervention designed to destroy Iran’s nuclear infrastructure.


      That line has been crossed — Iran is a de facto nuclear power, even if it hasn’t
      taken the final steps to complete the construction of a nuclear bomb.

      “The Israel Tax Authority has received applications for financial assistance for
      nearly 33,000 damaged structures,” reports the Israeli daily Haaretz.


      By Joe Lauria


      Special to Consortium News


      The damage assessment in Israel from Iran’s counterattack against Tel Aviv’s unprovoked
      aggression last month is coming in.




      Despite strenuous efforts by Israeli authorities to suppress news from bomb sites
      — including arresting news crews — the extent of the destruction suffered by Israel
      is now being revealed.


      The Israeli daily Haaretz reported on Monday that the vaunted Israeli air defense
      system, headlined by the so-called Iron Dome, failed to prevent a significant
      inundation of Iranian ordnance.


      Some single ballistic missiles landing on Israeli streets damaged a wide area
      of surrounding buildings purely from the vibrations of the impact, the newspaper
      reported.


      “Throughout Israel, between the shock waves and the direct impact of the heavy
      Iranian missiles, the destruction spread out over hundreds of meters,” Haaretz
      said. “Thousands of houses and buildings have been damaged, some severely, with
      exterior and interior walls collapsing.”


      “The common denominator is the person uprooted from his or her home, who will
      feel the shock for years,” the paper said. It further reported:


      “In Tel Aviv, 480 buildings have been damaged, many of them badly, at five separate
      sites. In Ramat Gan, it’s 237 buildings at three sites, about 10 badly. In another
      Tel Aviv suburb, Bat Yam, 78 buildings were damaged by one hit; 22 will have to
      be razed. The Israel Tax Authority has received applications for financial assistance
      for nearly 33,000 damaged structures. Another 4,450 files have been opened for
      the loss of belongings and equipment, and another 4,119 for damaged vehicles”.


      The Iranian attacks killed 29 Israeli civilians and, according to a Haaretz map,
      96 buildings were severely damaged.


      By contrast, in the 1991 Gulf War, Iraq fired 42 Scud missiles at Tel Aviv and
      Haifa, killing two Israelis and damaging 4,100 buildings, destroying 28.


      The Haaretz report deals only with civilian buildings. Iran also hit a number
      of Israeli military bases, including Kirya and Camp Moshe Dayan in Tel Aviv; as
      well as the BAZAN oil refinery in Haifa, causing significant damage; and the Weizmann
      Institute of Science in Rehovot, destroying two buildings.

      recent counterattack on Israel has resulted in nearly 33,000 applications for
      financial assistance due to damaged structures. Despite efforts by Israeli authorities
      to limit media coverage, the extent of destruction is becoming clear, with significant
      failures of the Iron Dome air defense system allowing Iranian missiles to cause
      widespread damage. In Tel Aviv alone, 480 buildings were affected, with many severely
      damaged, while the overall impact of the attacks has left 29 civilians dead and
      thousands of homes and vehicles damaged. The report highlights that the current
      situation is far worse than during the 1991 Gulf War, where fewer missiles caused
      less destruction. In addition to civilian infrastructure, Iranian strikes also
      targeted military bases and key facilities, further exacerbating the damage.

      It’s not a physical enemy to combat but rather powerful messages lodged in millions
      of people’s minds. It’s come to rule over us.




      By Joe Lauria


      Cathy Vogan, executive producer of Consortium News‘ webcast CN Live!, coined a
      new term to describe rule by psyops, or psychological operations: psyopcracy.
      And Consortium News‘ existence is devoted to fighting it.


      According to Wikipedia:


      “Psychological operations (PSYOP) are operations to convey selected information
      and indicators to audiences to influence their emotions, motives, and objective
      reasoning, and ultimately the behavior of governments, organizations, groups,
      and individuals. The purpose of United States psychological operations is to induce
      or reinforce behavior perceived to be favorable to U.S. objectives.”


      William Casey, C.I.A. director under Ronald Reagan, said: “We’ll know our disinformation
      program is complete when everything the American public believes is false.”


      Thus the American people are continuously subject to a number of psychological
      operations otherwise known as “the news.” Combating these false constructs of
      the world through media is Consortium News‘ mission.

      U.S. intelligence officials feed journalists disinformation to create a false
      narrative that is intended to mislead the public and cover-up what is actually
      taking place.


      The constant reinforcement of these lies becomes entrenched in the public mind
      and after time comes to be accepted as unquestionable truth.


      Here’s an explanation of how the C.I.A. did it in Vietnam:


      Through such operations, the American people were led to believe for years that
      the United States was winning in Vietnam, when it was actually losing, as the
      Pentagon Papers proved.


      Since then, many examples have followed of completely false stories being planted
      into people’s minds to start and keep a war going, the fake WMD narrative in Iraq
      perhaps the most infamous.


      Today the wars people are being fooled about are in Ukraine and Gaza.


      Sometimes a psyop doesn’t involve inserting false information, so much as leaving
      out what’s true.


      The American people, and by extension, people around the world, have been led
      to believe that an unprovoked Russian madman started the war in Ukraine.


      That’s because they are purposely not told that the war actually began in 2014
      after a U.S.-backed overthrow of the elected government in Kiev led Russian speakers
      in Donbass to declare independence, after which the illegitimate government militarily
      attacked them.


      Other facts are removed from the story, such as Russia’s proposed treaties with
      the U.S. and NATO in December 2021 that would have prevented Russia’s intervention
      in the Ukrainian civil war.


      And now the psyopcracy is deluding Western Europe into believing Russia is about
      to attack them.


      The history of Israel’s ethnic cleansing of Palestine is also whitewashed to lead
      the U.S. public into believing that Israel is the “victim” that is only “defending
      itself.”


      Robert Parry, the founder of this website, in March 2017 wrote the article, “How
      US Flooded the World with Psyops,” in which he reported for the first time:


      “Newly declassified documents from the Reagan presidential library help explain
      how the U.S. government developed its sophisticated psychological operations capabilities
      that – over the past three decades – have created an alternative reality both
      for people in targeted countries and for American citizens, a structure that expanded
      U.S. influence abroad and quieted dissent at home. The documents reveal the formation
      of a psyops bureaucracy under the direction of Walter Raymond Jr., a senior CIA
      covert operations specialist who was assigned to President Reagan’s National Security
      Council staff to enhance the importance of propaganda and psyops in undermining
      U.S. adversaries around the world and ensuring sufficient public support for foreign
      policies inside the United States.”


      So many people are subject to psyops that telling the truth becomes a formidable
      task. You become the one that is out of step. You are the one that seems to be
      mad.


      Consortium News‘s 30-year mission since 1995 has been to fight against psychological
      operations that have come to rule over Americans and other peoples, convincing
      them of all manner of falsehoods, such as that the U.S. is motivated by humanitarian
      and democratic principles rather than naked greed and a lust for domination.


      And that the Ukraine war was unprovoked and Israel is just defending itself.

      Israel has driven the region to a 4,000-km swash of violence from Libya to Iran
      through its reckless, lawless, and warmongering actions, all ultimately aimed
      at preventing a State of Palestine by “remaking” the Middle East.




      By Jeffrey D. Sachs and Sybil Fares


      Other News


      The attack by Israel and the U.S. on Iran had two significant effects.


      First, it once again exposed the root cause of turmoil in the region: Israel’s
      project to “reshape the Middle East” through regime-change, aimed at maintaining
      its dominance and blocking a Palestinian state. Second, it highlighted the futility
      and recklessness of this strategy.


      The only path to peace is a comprehensive agreement that addresses Palestine’s
      statehood, Israel’s security, Iran’s peaceful nuclear program and the economic
      recovery of the region.


      Israel wants to topple the Iranian government because Iran has supported proxies
      and non-state actors aligned with the Palestinians. Israel has also consistently
      undermined U.S.-Iran diplomacy regarding Iran’s nuclear program.


      Instead of endless wars, Israel’s security can be ensured by two key diplomatic
      steps – ending militancy by establishing a Palestinian state with U.N. Security
      Council guarantees, and lifting sanctions on Iran in exchange for a peaceful and
      verifiable nuclear program.


      The far-right Israeli government’s refusal to accept a Palestinian state is the
      root of the problem.


      When the British empire promised a Jewish homeland in Mandatory Palestine in 1917,
      the Palestinian Arabs constituted 90 percent of the population and Jews less than
      10 percent of the population.


      In 1947, with U.S. intense lobbying, the U.N. General Assembly voted to grant
      56 percent of Palestine to a new Zionist state, while the Jews were only 33 percent
      of the population. Palestinians rejected this as a violation of their right to
      self-determination.


      After the 1948 war, Israel expanded to 78 percent of Palestine, and in 1967, occupied
      the remaining 22 percent — Gaza, the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights.


      Instead of returning occupied lands in exchange for peace, Israeli right-wing
      politicians insisted on permanent control of 100 percent of the land, with the
      Likud founding charter declaring in 1977 that there would be only Israeli sovereignty
      “between the Sea and Jordan”.


      Benjamin Netanyahu represents this policy of domination — and has served as Israel’s
      prime minister for a total of 17 years since 1996. When he came to power, he and
      his U.S. neocon allies authored the “Clean Break” strategy to block the creation
      of a Palestinian state.


      Instead of pursuing land for peace, Israel aimed to reshape the Middle East by
      overthrowing governments that supported the Palestinian cause. The U.S. would
      be the implementing partner of this strategy.


      This is exactly what happened after 9/11, as the U.S. led or sponsored wars against
      Iraq (invasion in 2003), Lebanon (U.S. funding and arming Israeli aggressions),
      Libya (NATO bombing in 2011), Syria (C.I.A. operation during 2010’s), Sudan (supporting
      rebels to break Sudan apart in 2011) and Somalia (backing Ethiopia’s invasion
      in 2006).


      Contrary to the glib promises by Netanyahu to the U.S. Congress in 2002 — that
      regime change in Iraq would bring a new day to the Middle East — the 2003 Iraq
      War augured the events that were to come across the region. Iraq descended into
      turmoil, and since then, each new war has brought death, destruction, and economic
      disarray.


      This month, Israel attacked Iran even as negotiations between Iran and the U.S.
      were underway to ensure the peaceful use of Iran’s nuclear program — repeating
      the same WMD propaganda that Netanyahu used to justify the Iraq War.


      Israel has been claiming for more than 30 years that Iran is on the verge of acquiring
      nuclear weapons. However, on June 18, the IAEA director general stated that there
      is “no proof of a systematic effort” by Iran to develop nuclear weapons.


      More to the point, Iran and the U.S. were actively engaged in negotiations according
      to which the IAEA would monitor and verify the peaceful nature of Iran’s nuclear
      program.


      The attack on Iran proves yet again the futility and nihilism of Netanyahu’s approach.
      The Israeli and U.S. attacks accomplished nothing positive. According to most
      analysts, Iran’s enriched uranium remains intact, but is now in a secret location
      rather than under IAEA monitoring. In the meantime, with Israel’s ongoing genocide
      in Gaza – neither peace nor security have been achieved.


      Israel has driven the region to a 4,000-km swash of violence from Libya to Iran
      through its reckless, lawless, and warmongering actions, all ultimately aimed
      at preventing a State of Palestine by “remaking” the Middle East.


      The solution is clear: it is time for the United States to recognize that its
      own strategic interests require a decisive break from partnering in Israel’s destructive
      strategy.


      Prioritizing genuine peace in the Middle East is not only a moral imperative,
      but a fundamental U.S. interest — one that can only be achieved through a comprehensive
      peace deal. The key pillar of this deal is for the U.S. to lift its veto on a
      Palestinian State on the borders of June 4, 1967, and to do so at the start, not
      in some vague distant future that never actually arrives.


      For more than 20 years, Arab nations have backed a practical peace plan. So too
      has the Organization for Islamic Cooperation (OIC), with its 57 member countries,
      and the League of Arab States (LAS), with its 22 members. So too have almost all
      the nations in the U.N. General Assembly. So too has the International Court of
      Justice in its 2024 ruling that Israel’s occupation is illegal. Only Israel, with
      support from the U.S. veto, has stood in the way.


      Seven-Point Peace Plan


      Here is a seven-point peace plan in which all parties would benefit. Israel would
      gain peace and security. Palestine would achieve statehood. Iran would win an
      end to economic sanctions. The U.S. would win an end to costly and illegal wars
      fought on Israel’s behalf, as well as the risks of nuclear proliferation if the
      current violence continues. The Middle East would win economic development, security
      and justice.


      – First, an immediate ceasefire would apply across the entire region — and the
      ceasefire would include an immediate release of all hostages and prisoners.


      – Second, the U.N Security Council would vote upfront to welcome Palestine as
      the 194th U.N. Member State on the June 4, 1967, borders, with East Jerusalem
      as its capital. Israel and Palestine could subsequently agree on mutually desired
      border adjustments.


      – Third, Israel would withdraw from all territories occupied since 1967. U.N.-mandated
      international forces would ensure a peaceful, orderly transition, a transfer of
      Palestinian territories to Palestinian authorities, and mutual security for both
      Israel and Palestine.


      – Fourth, territorial integrity and sovereignty would be guaranteed for Lebanon,
      Syria and all states in the region. All non-state armed groups would be demilitarized,
      and foreign troops would be withdrawn.


      – Fifth, the U.N. Security Council would adopt an updated nuclear agreement with
      Iran, including binding verification, and with all economic sanctions on Iran
      lifted alongside Iran’s verified compliance with the peaceful uses of its nuclear
      program.


      – Sixth, Israel and all Arab and Islamic states would establish full diplomatic
      relations following the admission of the State of Palestine as U.N. member state.


      – Seventh, the Middle East nations would establish an international fund for rebuilding
      the war-torn parts of Lebanon, Syria and Palestine, with contributions coming
      from within the region and from external sources.

      The final impediment to the annexation of Gaza are the Palestinians themselves.
      They are the primary target. Starvation is the weapon of choice.




      By Chris Hedges


      ScheerPost


      Israel’s weaponization of starvation is how genocides always end.


      I covered the insidious effects of orchestrated starvation in the Guatemalan Highlands
      during the genocidal campaign of Gen. Efraín Ríos Montt, the famine in southern
      Sudan that left a quarter of a million dead — I walked past the frail and skeletal
      corpses of families lining roadsides — and later during the war in Bosnia when
      Serbs cut off food supplies to enclaves such as Srebrencia and Goražde.


      Starvation was weaponized by the Ottoman Empire to decimate the Armenians. It
      was used to kill millions of Ukrainians in the Holodomor in 1932 and 1933.


      It was employed by the Nazis against the Jews in the ghettos in World War II.
      German soldiers used food, as Israel does, like bait. They offered three kilograms
      of bread and one kilogram of marmalade to lure desperate families in the Warsaw
      Ghetto onto transports to the death camps.


      “There were times when hundreds of people had to wait in line for several days
      to be ‘deported,’” Marek Edelman writes in The Ghetto Fights. “The number of people
      anxious to obtain the three kilograms of bread was such that the transports, now
      leaving twice daily with 12,000 people, could not accommodate them all.”


      And when crowds became unruly, as in Gaza, the German troops fired deadly volleys
      that ripped through emaciated husks of women, children and the elderly.


      This tactic is as old as warfare itself.


      The report in the Israeli newspaper Haaretz that Israeli soldiers are ordered
      to shoot into crowds of Palestinians at aid hubs, with 580 killed and 4,216 wounded,
      is not a surprise.


      It is the predictable denouement of the genocide, the inevitable conclusion to
      a campaign of mass extermination.

      who say unarmed, starving Palestinians are being shot without reason at Gaza Humanitarian
      Foundation (GHF) aid distribution sites. pic.twitter.com/GMHFXOxdh9 — Al Jazeera
      English (@AJEnglish) June 29, 2025


      Israel, with its targeted assassinations of at least 1,400 health care workers,
      hundreds of United Nations workers, journalists, police and even poets and academics,
      its obliteration of multi-story apartment blocks wiping out dozens of families,
      its shelling of designated “humanitarian zones” where Palestinians huddle under
      tents, tarps or in the open air, its systematic targeting of U.N. food distribution
      centers, bakeries and aid convoys or its sadistic sniper fire that guns down children,
      long ago illustrated that Palestinians are regarded as vermin worthy only of annihilation.


      The blockade of food and humanitarian aid, imposed on Gaza since March 2, is reducing
      Palestinians to abject dependence. To eat, they must crawl towards their killers
      and beg. Humiliated, terrified, desperate for a few scraps of food, they are stripped
      of dignity, autonomy and agency. This is by intent.


      Yousef al-Ajouri, 40, explained to Middle East Eye his nightmarish journey to
      one of four aid hubs set up by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF). The hubs
      are not designed to meet the needs of the Palestinians, who once relied on 400
      aid distribution sites, but to lure them from northern Gaza to the south.


      Israel, which on Sunday again ordered Palestinians to leave northern Gaza, is
      steadily expanding its annexation of the coastal strip. Palestinians are corralled
      like livestock into narrow metal chutes at distribution points which are overseen
      by heavily armed mercenaries. They receive, if they are one of the fortunate few,
      a small box of food.


      Al-Ajouri, who before the genocide was a taxi driver, lives with his wife, seven
      children and his mother and father in a tent in al-Saraya, near the middle of
      Gaza City. He set out to an aid hub at Salah al-Din Road near the Netzarim corridor,
      to find some food for his children, who he said cry constantly “because of how
      hungry they are.”


      On the advice of his neighbor in the tent next to him, he dressed in loose clothing
      “so that I could run and be agile.” He carried a bag for canned and packaged goods
      because the crush of the crowds meant “no one was able to carry the boxes the
      aid came in.”


      He left at about 9 p.m. with five other men “including an engineer and a teacher,”
      and “children aged 10 and 12.” They did not take the official route designated
      by the Israeli army. The massive crowds converging on the aid point along the
      official route ensure that most never get close enough to receive food.


      Instead, they walked in the darkness in areas exposed to Israeli gunfire, often
      having to crawl to avoid being seen.


      “As I crawled, I looked over, and to my surprise, saw several women and elderly
      people taking the same treacherous route as us,” he explained.


      “At one point, there was a barrage of live gunfire all around me. We hid behind
      a destroyed building. Anyone who moved or made a noticeable motion was immediately
      shot by snipers. Next to me was a tall, light-haired young man using the flashlight
      on his phone to guide him. The others yelled at him to turn it off. Seconds later,
      he was shot. He collapsed to the ground and lay there bleeding, but no one could
      help or move him. He died within minutes.”


      He passed six bodies along the route who had been shot dead by Israeli soldiers.


      Al-Ajouri reached the hub at 2 a.m., the designated time for aid distribution.
      He saw a green light turned on ahead of him which signaled that aid was about
      to be distributed. Thousands began to run towards the light, pushing, shoving
      and trampling each other. He fought his way through the crowd until he reached
      the aid.


      “I started feeling around for the aid boxes and grabbed a bag that felt like rice,”
      he said.


      “But just as I did, someone else snatched it from my hands. I tried to hold on,
      but he threatened to stab me with his knife. Most people there were carrying knives,
      either to defend themselves or to steal from others. Eventually, I managed to
      grab four cans of beans, a kilogram of bulgur, and half a kilogram of pasta. Within
      moments, the boxes were empty. Most of the people there, including women, children
      and the elderly, got nothing. Some begged others to share. But no one could afford
      to give up what they managed to get.”


      The U.S. contractors and Israeli soldiers overseeing the mayhem laughed and pointed
      their weapons at the crowd. Some filmed with their phones.


      “Minutes later, red smoke grenades were thrown into the air,” he remembered.


      “Someone told me that it was the signal to evacuate the area. After that, heavy
      gunfire began. Me, Khalil and a few others headed to al-Awda Hospital in Nuseirat
      because our friend Wael had injured his hand during the journey. I was shocked
      by what I saw at the hospital. There were at least 35 martyrs lying dead on the
      ground in one of the rooms. A doctor told me they had all been brought in that
      same day. They were each shot in the head or chest while queuing near the aid
      center. Their families were waiting for them to come home with food and ingredients.
      Now, they were corpses.”


      GHF is a Mossad-funded creation of Israel’s Defense Ministry that contracts with
      UG Solutions and Safe Reach Solutions, run by former members of the C.I.A. and
      U.S. Special Forces. GHF is headed by Rev. Johnnie Moore, a far-right Christian
      Zionist with close ties to Donald Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu. The organization
      has also contracted anti-Hamas drug-smuggling gangs to provide security at aid
      sites.


      As Chris Gunness, a former spokesperson for the United Nations Relief and Work
      Agency (UNRWA) told Al Jazeera, GHF is “aid washing,” a way to mask the reality
      that “people are being starved into submission.”


      Israel, along with the U.S. and European countries that provide weapons to sustain
      the genocide, have chosen to disregard the January 2024 ruling by the International
      Court of Justice (ICJ) which demanded immediate protection for civilians in Gaza
      and widespread provision of humanitarian assistance.


      Haaretz, in its article headlined “‘It’s a Killing Field’: IDF Soldiers Ordered
      to Shoot Deliberately at Unarmed Gazans Waiting for Humanitarian Aid” reported
      that Israeli commanders order soldiers to open fire on crowds to keep them away
      from aid sites or disperse them.


      “The distribution centers typically open for just one hour each morning,” the
      report says.


      “According to officers and soldiers who served in their areas, the IDF fires at
      people who arrive before opening hours to prevent them from approaching, or again
      after the centers close, to disperse them. Since some of the shooting incidents
      occurred at night — ahead of the opening — it’s possible that some civilians couldn’t
      see the boundaries of the designated area.”


      “It’s a killing field,” one soldier told Haaretz.


      “Where I was stationed, between one and five people were killed every day. They’re
      treated like a hostile force — no crowd-control measures, no tear gas — just live
      fire with everything imaginable: heavy machine guns, grenade launchers, mortars.
      Then, once the center opens, the shooting stops, and they know they can approach.
      Our form of communication is gunfire.”


      “We open fire early in the morning if someone tries to get in line from a few
      hundred meters away, and sometimes we just charge at them from close range. But
      there’s no danger to the forces,” the soldier explained, “I’m not aware of a single
      instance of return fire. There’s no enemy, no weapons.”


      He said the deployment at the aid sites is known as “Operation Salted Fish,” a
      reference to the Israeli name for the children’s game “Red light, green light.”
      The game was featured in the first episode of the South Korean dystopian thriller
      Squid Game, in which financially desperate people are killed as they battle each
      other for money.


      Israel has obliterated the civilian and humanitarian infrastructure in Gaza. It
      has reduced Palestinians, half a million of whom face starvation, into desperate
      herds. The goal is to break Palestinians, to make them malleable and entice them
      to leave Gaza, never to return.


      There is talk from the Trump White House about a ceasefire. But don’t be fooled.
      Israel has nothing left to destroy. Its saturation bombing over 20 months has
      reduced Gaza to a moonscape.


      Gaza is uninhabitable, a toxic wilderness where Palestinians, living amid broken
      slabs of concrete and pools of raw sewage, lack food and clean water, fuel, shelter,
      electricity, medicine and an infrastructure to survive.


      The final impediment to the annexation of Gaza are the Palestinians themselves.
      They are the primary target. Starvation is the weapon of choice.

      Israel sees an opportunity in a Europe rearming because of the supposed threat
      of Russia, writes Jessica Buxbaum.




      By Jessica Buxbaum


      MintPress News


      NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte and European Commissioner for Defence and Space
      Andrius Kubilius [actually] believe Russia could launch a full-scale attack on
      Europe by 2030, a fear that has prompted governments across the continent to prepare
      for war.


      As European citizens are advised to stockpile food and governments ramp up military
      readiness, one country sees opportunity in that [trumped up] fear: Israel.


      The European Union is planning to increase its military budget by €800 billion
      ($900 billion) over the next four years. With the United States pulling back military
      support for NATO, EU member states are seeking new defense partners, and Israel
      is stepping in, offering weapons tested on occupied and besieged populations.


      As governments across Europe prepare for [what they say is] a potential Russian
      assault, they are deepening defense ties with Israel, buying billions in battle-tested
      weapons even as Israel faces genocide accusations in the International Court of
      Justice.


      Between 2020 and 2024, European arms imports increased by 155 percent compared
      to the previous five years, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research
      Institute (SIPRI). Over that same period, Israel climbed the ranks of global arms
      exporters, now standing eighth worldwide.


      The surge in sales reflects a growing European reliance on Israeli military technology.
      In 2023, EU nations imported $111 million in Israeli arms. By 2024, that number
      jumped to $135 million, even as European governments publicly condemned Israel’s
      war in Gaza.


      “Militaries often are quite interested in real-life experience witnessed by other
      militaries,” Dr. Iain Overton, executive director of Action on Armed Violence,
      told MintPress News. Israel’s repeated assaults on Gaza and the West Bank — and
      its long-running campaigns in Syria and Lebanon — have become central to its marketing
      pitch.


      Under what Australian journalist Antony Loewenstein termed the “Palestine Laboratory,”
      Israel uses the occupied Palestinian territories as a testing ground for its military
      technology, and then manipulates the success of its state violence to boost its
      ammunition sales.


      [WATCH: The Palestine Laboratory & Surveillance Capitalism]


      “[Israel’s] experience feeds back into its own production of weapons where they
      can say this is battle-tested,” Overton said. He added:


      “If we only look at [arms transfers] through the prism of that they’re battle-tested,
      and we don’t look at it through the prism of the fact that they’re often indiscriminate
      or they cause large numbers of civilian harm… then we might inadvertently be purchasing
      more lethal weapons than necessary or weapons that actually do not fit the European
      standards of international humanitarian law in conflict.”


      Spain & Poland Criticize Israel, But Buy Its Weapons


      Spain has been one of Israel’s loudest critics since the Gaza war began in October
      2023. Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez even called for a global arms moratorium. Yet
      Centre Delas, a Barcelona-based think tank, revealed in April that the Spanish
      government had awarded 46 contracts totaling $1.2 billion to Israeli arms manufacturers
      since the war began.


      Among them: 12 PULS rocket launchers from Elbit Systems, 64 Predator Hawk missiles,
      and 168 additional missiles from Rafael Advanced Defense Systems. Contracts also
      went to Netline Communications Technologies and Guardian Homeland Security.


      In Israel’s largest arms sale to date, Germany purchased the U.S.-Israel jointly
      produced Arrow 3 missile defense system for $4.3 billion in September 2024. In
      February 2025, the German army bought Elbit’s PULS rocket launcher artillery systems
      in a $57 million deal. Two months later, Germany’s Defense Ministry announced
      it was procuring loitering munitions — commonly known as suicide drones — from
      Israeli firms UVision and Israel Aerospace Industries.


      Germany is Israel’s second-largest weapons customer after the United States, and
      Israel is one of Germany’s top arms exporters, supplying 13 percent of the country’s
      weapons.


      “Israeli components are built into Germany’s military capacities, and that for
      them is far more important than any International Court of Justice genocide ruling,”
      said Jeff Halper, an Israeli anthropologist and author of War Against the People,
      which details how Israel uses its weapons technology on Palestinians.


      Finland signed a €316 million ($356 million) deal for Israel’s David’s Sling air
      defenses in 2023. The Nordic nation finalized the sale in November 2023, a month
      into Israel’s assault on Gaza. Finland’s president, Alexander Stubb, defended
      the deal in an interview with Reuters, saying the purchase wasn’t related to Finland’s
      decision not to recognize a Palestinian state.


      Israel and Greece have also strengthened their military partnership in recent
      years. In 2023, Greece purchased a $404 million package of Spike missiles and
      Orbiter 3 drones, produced by Israeli defense firms Rafael and Aeronautics.


      At this year’s DEFEA, an international defense exhibition held in Athens, Israel
      Aerospace Industries and Hellenic Aerospace Industry signed an agreement for IAI
      to supply its BlueWhale autonomous submarine system to the Hellenic Navy.


      Following the collapse of a fragile cease-fire in Gaza on March 18, 2025, the
      Netherlands announced it would individually assess future sales of weapons and
      dual-use goods to Israel.


      The Dutch government said it has not exported weapons to Israel since the start
      of the war, a result of a February 2024 Dutch court order prohibiting the export
      of F-35 fighter jet parts over concerns they could be used in violation of international
      law in Gaza. However, the Netherlands has continued to import Israeli arms.


      In September 2024, the Dutch Navy purchased two vessels equipped with drones and
      missiles for between $279 million and $1.1 billion. In December, the Netherlands
      awarded Elbit Systems a $175 million contract to supply the NATO member with systems
      to protect aircraft and helicopters from anti-aircraft missiles. Elbit also secured
      a $53 million contract in May 2024 to supply armored vehicles to Austria.


      Several countries bordering Ukraine have also increased weapons imports from Israel.


      Poland’s new government declared in May 2024 that it would not export military
      equipment to Israel and had not signed any new contracts.


      “We will not have a hand in Israeli attacks on civilians in the Gaza Strip using
      Polish weapons,” Deputy Foreign Minister Andrzej Szejna said.


      Yet Polish media reported in February that the country would purchase 1,400 Borsuk
      infantry fighting vehicles armed with Rafael’s Spike missile launchers.

      In its largest arms deal with Israel, Slovakia bought the IAI-manufactured Barak
      MX air defense system for $583 million in December 2024. In a separate $92 million
      deal, Romania purchased Rafael-made Spike LR2 anti-tank missiles in February 2024.
      One month later, Elbit Systems won a $60 million contract to supply Romania with
      counter-drone systems.


      In a show of solidarity, Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala visited Israel after
      it launched its war on Gaza following the Hamas attack in October 2023. During
      the visit, the Czech Republic signed a contract to purchase 48 Rafael-manufactured
      I-Derby long-range anti-aircraft missiles for $120 million.


      This year, Axon Vision, an Israeli AI provider for militaries, partnered with
      Czech arms company Czechoslovak Group to install its AI-based situational awareness
      system on Czech military armored vehicles.


      At the start of 2025, Serbia finalized its purchase of Elbit Systems’ PULS artillery
      rocket systems and Hermes 900 reconnaissance drones in a $335 million deal.


      Also at the beginning of the year, the Swedish Dockworkers Union implemented a
      blockade against all military trade with Israel amid the ongoing war. Before the
      embargo, Swedish imports of Israeli military equipment had already surged, skyrocketing
      from $737,000 in 2023 to $23.8 million in 2024.


      In 2024, Sweden signed a $36.6 million contract for Rafael Litening targeting
      pods for a fleet of fighter jets. Swedish defense firm BAE Systems Hägglunds also
      signed a $130 million deal with Elbit Systems for its Iron Fist Active Protection
      Systems.


      This year, Sweden signed a €2 billion ($2.26 billion) agreement with European
      defense company KNDS for 44 advanced Leopard 2 A8 main battle tanks equipped with
      Israeli firm Rafael’s Trophy active protection system.


      Treaties Ignored as Israel Arms Europe


      Despite the ICJ’s 2024 preliminary ruling that Palestinians have a “plausible
      right to protection from genocide,” European arms deals with Israel continue unabated.
      And international treaties are no obstacle. Overton tells MintPress News that:.


      “While the [UN Arms Trade Treaty] seeks to prevent arms transfers that could be
      used to commit human rights violations, its provisions are riddled with loopholes,
      and enforcement mechanisms remain weak.”


      Most of the weapons Israel sells — missiles, drones, surveillance systems — don’t
      fall under banned categories like white phosphorus, even if they’re used in ways
      that violate humanitarian law, even if they’re used in densely populated civilian
      areas in violation of international law.


      “In this regard, Israeli arms exports fall within the realm of ethics and morality,
      not treaties,” Overton said. “The question is: Should we be profiting from Israel?”


      He compares the situation to sanctioned states like North Korea or Russia. But
      unlike those countries, Israel faces few material consequences.


      While some EU nations announce embargoes or reassess trade agreements, Halper
      remains skeptical.


      “They’ll do it on a symbolic level,” he said. “They’ll send a message to Israel
      in a way that doesn’t really impact its military capacity.”


      “There is no morality in international politics,” Halper added.


      As Europe re-arms for [what it sees as] the next global war, it is doing so with
      weapons tested on occupied people, in neighborhoods flattened by airstrikes, and
      in refugee camps targeted by one of the most technologically advanced militaries
      on earth. Whether symbolic sanctions will ever evolve into meaningful action remains
      to be seen, but for now, business is booming.

    one_sentence_summary: As European nations ramp up military spending in response
      to perceived threats from Russia, Israel is capitalizing on this opportunity by
      significantly increasing arms exports to these countries, despite facing international
      criticism and accusations of human rights violations.
    paragraph_summary: The article by Jessica Buxbaum discusses how Israel is capitalizing
      on Europe's rearmament in response to perceived threats from Russia, particularly
      as NATO and EU nations increase military budgets and seek new defense partners
      amid a shifting geopolitical landscape. Despite facing accusations of genocide
      in the International Court of Justice, Israel has seen a significant rise in arms
      sales to European countries, with imports of Israeli weaponry increasing dramatically.
      Nations like Spain, Germany, and Poland have made substantial purchases of Israeli
      military technology, even as they publicly criticize Israel's actions in Gaza.
      The article highlights the ethical implications of these arms deals, noting that
      many European governments continue to engage with Israel despite international
      treaties aimed at preventing arms transfers that could lead to human rights violations.
      As Europe prepares for potential conflict, Israel's military technology, tested
      in occupied territories, becomes increasingly integrated into European defense
      systems, raising questions about the morality of profiting from such transactions.

      Israel, the U.K. government and the media are fomenting moral panic over words
      “glorifying violence” towards the IDF while the Israeli military inflicts carnage
      in Gaza and the region.


      By Jonathan Cook


      Jonathan-Cook.net


      U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer expressed predictable outrage at the weekend
      that the BBC had inadvertently broadcast punk band Bob Vylan leading crowds at
      Glastonbury in a chant of “Death to the IDF” – the “Israel Defence Forces” that
      have been responsible for slaughtering many tens of thousands of Palestinians
      in Gaza over the past 21 months.


      He called the chant “appalling hate speech” — apparently unaware that there are
      far worse crimes than hating soldiers carrying out the mass slaughter of children.
      Those worse things, of course, include slaughtering children en masse.


      The BBC apologised, calling the band’s comments “deeply offensive” – more offensive,
      apparently, than Israel bombing and starving the children of Gaza.

      Glastonbury’s organisers condemned the chant, saying there was no space for “hate
      speech or antisemitism” — apparently assuming, wrongly, that all Jews identify
      not just with the state of Israel but with an Israeli military widely accused
      by genocide experts of committing genocidal violence in Gaza.


      I’m a British Jew in England I didn’t interpret #DeathToTheIDF as a call for people
      to kill me because 1. I’m not in the IDF 2. It doesn’t call for the death of individuals
      – the clue is in “The IDF” 3. I’m not brain dead — Stop The Bollocks with Mirabel

      Police are investigating Bob Vylan, a musical duo, to see whether they have committed
      a criminal offence, or possibly a terrorist one. As far as we know, the same police
      are doing nothing to investigate some 10 British citizens known to have travelled
      abroad to join the Israeli military, the IDF, committing the Gaza genocide.


      [On Monday, the U.S. State Department cancelled the group’s visas ahead of a U.S.
      tour scheduled to begin in the fall and United Talent Agency dropped the duo,
      according to The Hollywood Reporter.]


      On Sunday, the BBC’s Victoria Derbyshire grilled Starmer’s health secretary, Wes
      Streeting, on remarks from the Israeli embassy in London condemning what it termed
      “the normalisation of extremist language” and the “glorification of violence”
      at Glastonbury.


      Unexpectedly, Streeting avoided jumping whole-heartedly on the media outrage band-wagon,
      led by the Mail on Sunday, whose front page demanded the arrest of the two band
      members for what the paper wrongly described as a chant demanding “Death to Israelis”.


      The Mail, apparently, believes that all Israelis, presumably including the country’s
      children, are currently serving in the Israeli military.


      “I’d say to the Israeli embassy, get your own house in order” Health Secretary
      Wes Streeting responds to Israel’s claims on Glastonbury’s “glorification of violence”,
      saying “Israeli settler terrorists” carried out “unwanton acts of violence”#BBCLauraKhttps://t.co/v2HwddQuYEpic.twitter.com/DRoqBMrVM6
      — BBC Politics (@BBCPolitics) June 29, 2025


      There are four important points to make about the interview between Derbyshire
      and Streeting:


      1. The Israeli embassy in London, like the Israeli government it represents, has
      precisely no concerns about the “glorification of violence” when Israel is doing
      either the glorifying or the violence.


      Israel is currently celebrating its “success” in slaughtering and maiming hundreds
      of thousands of Palestinians in Gaza, including huge numbers of children; attacks
      by its soldiers and state-backed Jewish settler militias on Palestinian civilians
      in the West Bank; its eradication of whole communities in Lebanon; and its bombing
      of residential tower blocks across Tehran, killing many hundreds.


      Violence has been Israel’s signature policy for the past 21 months — and long
      before that. Israel has revelled in the carnage it has inflicted on populations
      across the region.


      In a post on social media, the Israeli embassy additionally argued of Bob Vylan’s
      chant:


      “When speech crosses into incitement, hatred, and advocacy of ethnic cleansing,
      it must be called out — especially when amplified by public figures on prominent
      platforms.”


      And yet public figures from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to Starmer
      have incited against the Palestinians, with Netanyahu comparing them to “Amalek”,
      a people the Israelites were commanded by God to exterminate, and Starmer terming
      the wholesale starvation of the people of Gaza an act by Israel of “self-defence”.


      Israeli officials from Netanyahu down have advocated the ethnic cleansing of Gaza.
      And, even more seriously, Israel has not just threatened but repeatedly carried
      out the ethnic cleansing of Palestinians under its belligerent rule.


      2. It is beyond ridiculous for the BBC to echo the Israeli government in prioritising
      a harsh crackdown on words at Glastonbury “glorifying violence” towards Israeli
      soldiers ahead of the actual violence of genocide being committed by those Israel
      soldiers.


      The BBC has avoided criticising the Israeli government for its actual violence
      — its bombing and active starvation of Palestinian civilians — and the Starmer
      government for colluding in that violence, or what the International Court of
      Justice termed more than a year ago a “plausible” genocide by Israel.


      As a recent report by the Centre for Media Monitoring confirmed, the BBC has dramatically
      skewed its language to present Israel, the aggressor, in a more favourable light
      than the victim, the Palestinians of Gaza. The BBC’s own whistleblowing journalists
      have warned that the state broadcaster has all but banned the use of the word
      “genocide”, even by experts on the matter.


      [See: Jonathan Cook: The BBC’s Complicity in Genocide]


      By arming Israel, by organising spy flights over Gaza from RAF base Akrotiri on
      Cyprus, and by providing diplomatic cover, Starmer has effectively glorified Israel’s
      slaughter of Palestinian children in the enclave.


      Bob Vylan’s chants of “Death to the IDF” have a far more dangerous counterpart
      in Starmer’s recital of Israel’s “right to defend itself” when that “defence”
      involves Israel mercilessly starving Gaza’s population of food, water and power.


      Bob Vylan are a punk band; Starmer is the British prime minister, the man who
      directs Britain’s foreign policy and directs its army.


      No one, least of all the BBC, has held Israeli or British officials accountable
      not just for glorifying violence but for actually carrying it out on an industrial
      scale for nearly two years.


      But the BBC is suddenly interested in holding to account two punk musicians for
      leading a chant — one that made a symbolic, hypothetical threat of violence —
      against an Israeli military carrying out the ultimate form of violence, an actual
      genocide.


      In a serious media, Israel’s supposed “concerns” about the glorification of violence
      and extremist language would be laughed off the stage rather than respectfully
      aired.


      3. Streeting is being congratulated and condemned in equal measure on social media
      for refusing to be drawn into the Mail and BBC’s confected outrage. “I’d say to
      the Israeli embassy, get your own house in order,” he responded to Derbyshire.
      But hang on a minute. Streeting’s resistance to Derbyshire’s line of questioning
      was perhaps unexpected. But it also, let us not forget, serves the interests of
      both the Starmer and Israeli governments.


      Streeting’s insistence that Israel “get its house in order” had, as he made clear,
      nothing to do with its 21-month slaughter of Palestinians in Gaza. Starmer is
      still defining the Gaza genocide as Israel’s supposed “right to defend itself.”


      In responding to Derbyshire, Streeting expressed concern only at what he called
      violent “settler attacks” in the West Bank. He said the Israeli embassy needed
      to “get your own house in order in terms of the conduct of your own citizens and
      the settlers in the West Bank.”


      This was intended purely as deflection, designed to serve Starmer and Israel,
      the West’s key client state in the oil-rich Middle East. It benefits the U.K.
      government to make an issue of West Bank settler attacks — and present them as
      disorganised, random violence by individual extremists that the Israeli government
      is not responsible for but needs to get a firmer grip on.


      By highlighting problems in the West Bank, the Starmer government can avoid addressing
      the genocide in Gaza and the Israeli state’s clear responsibility for that genocide.
      Which is precisely why in recent weeks Britain has made so much noise about imposing
      feeble penalties on a handful of extremist settlers and two fascist ministers
      in Netanyahu’s government that represent those settlers.


      Starmer and Streeting’s prioritising of Israel’s West Bank violence over Israel’s
      Gaza violence is a switch and bait twice over.


      Most of the violence in the West Bank is not coming from settler extremists, even
      though they are the ones being punished by the U.K. It is coming from the Israeli
      military, which has bulldozed thousands of homes there over the past year, driving
      40,000 Palestinians off their lands.


      Further, settler violence is not random. It is coordinated with Israeli field
      commanders, many of them settlers themselves, to uproot Palestinians so that Israel
      can move in Jewish settlers to colonise the land — or, in the words of successive
      Israeli governments, “Judaise” it.


      None of this is new either. Israel has engineered and imposed a violent, apartheid
      system on Palestinians for decades to make life unbearable and encourage them
      to leave their homeland.


      Second, Glastonbury’s anger-fuelled chant against the IDF was not primarily motivated
      by Israel’s violent actions in the West Bank. It was against the Israeli military
      for committing a genocide in Gaza, which the British government has been supporting.


      Streeting’s aim was to drag the debate on to safer territory for him and Starmer:
      that Britain needs to deal not with a genocide in Gaza but with a handful of violent
      loons in the West Bank.


      Even in criticising the Israeli government for not doing enough to tackle settler
      violence, Streeting is still operating within the confines of a public discourse
      dictated by Israel, which prefers any criticism to be directed at individuals
      not at the Israeli state behind those individuals.


      4. The BBC, the Starmer government and the Israel lobby are all delighted to play
      their part in this game of deflection and deception because these kinds of moral
      panics obscure the real issue: that all these parties are actively colluding in
      Israel’s genocide in Gaza.


      While the media and government can now have a long backwards and forwards about
      whether criticism of Israel’s genocidal army needs to be defined in law as a criminal
      offence or “terrorism”, Israel will get a free pass to continue with the real
      terrorism: a genocide in Gaza.


      Famously, the black civil rights fighter Malcolm X observed of the role of the
      media:


      “They have the power to make the innocent guilty and to make the guilty innocent,
      and that’s power. … If you’re not careful, the newspapers will have you hating
      the people who are being oppressed, and loving the people who are doing the oppressing.”


      Sixty years on, nothing has changed.

      expressed by U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer and the media over a chant by the
      punk band Bob Vylan at Glastonbury, which called for "Death to the IDF," while
      ignoring the ongoing violence and alleged genocide perpetrated by the Israeli

      words distracts from the real atrocities committed by the Israeli government,
      which has been responsible for the deaths of tens of thousands of Palestinians,
      including children. He highlights the hypocrisy of the BBC and the U.K. government,
      which prioritize condemning symbolic expressions of dissent over addressing the
      actual violence and suffering inflicted on civilians. Cook suggests that this
      moral panic serves to obscure the complicity of Western governments and media
      in Israel's actions, allowing them to evade accountability for their role in the
      ongoing conflict.
