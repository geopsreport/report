summary: |
  As the NATO Summit in The Hague approaches (June 24-25), the Ukraine war remains the central issue shaping transatlantic relations and wider European security. The Trump administration faces mounting pressure to present a comprehensive U.S. peace plan that addresses not only a ceasefire but also the broader complexities of the conflict, as highlighted by **Anatol Lieven**. This comes amid growing European assertiveness, particularly through new EU sanctions targeting Russia’s “shadow fleet” of oil tankers—measures that risk direct confrontation with Moscow and have been enacted without U.S. consultation.
  
  **Peace Plan Imperatives and U.S. Leverage**
  
  According to **Anatol Lieven**, the U.S. must articulate clear negotiation terms for Ukraine and Russia, including a ceasefire along current battle lines, future talks on territorial status, mutual pledges against aggression, and conditional sanctions relief. The Trump administration is advised to clarify that continued U.S. support for Ukraine depends on Kyiv and Brussels’ acceptance of these terms, while also outlining consequences for Russian non-compliance. This approach is designed to create a realistic path to peace and maintain Ukraine’s defensive capabilities, even as both Kyiv and Moscow remain entrenched in incompatible positions. There is a high chance that without robust U.S. engagement, peace prospects will remain bleak.
  
  **Escalating Risks from European Sanctions**
  
  The EU’s recent move to sanction and potentially seize Russian “shadow fleet” oil tankers—especially Sweden’s plans to inspect vessels in its economic zone—has heightened the risk of direct military confrontation. **Lieven** warns that these actions could provoke aggressive Russian responses, particularly if hardliners in Moscow perceive Western moves as existential threats. The lack of U.S. consultation on these measures complicates Washington’s position, potentially straining relations with both European allies and partners like India. There is a high chance that further escalation could draw the U.S. into a crisis not of its own making, underscoring the need for Washington to clarify its stance.
  
  **Stalled Peace Talks and the Need for U.S. Mediation**
  
  Recent Istanbul talks between Ukraine and Russia have revealed a persistent lack of interest in genuine compromise, with both sides presenting mutually exclusive demands. **Lieven** emphasizes that only strong U.S. intervention—anchored in a comprehensive peace plan—can break the deadlock. The risk of continued hostilities escalating into direct NATO-Russia confrontation remains significant, especially as European actions become more assertive.
  
  **Trends and Predictions**
  
  The dominant trend is the increasing divergence between U.S. and European approaches to Russia, with Europe taking bolder unilateral actions that risk escalation. The U.S. is likely to face mounting pressure to mediate and restrain both sides, especially as the NATO Summit looms. There is a high chance that the Trump administration will attempt to assert leadership by proposing a detailed peace framework, but success will depend on buy-in from both European allies and Ukraine.
  
  Looking ahead, I guarantee that without a coordinated and realistic U.S.-led peace initiative, the conflict will continue to pose grave risks of escalation, both militarily and politically, for Europe and the broader transatlantic alliance.

  - title: The 17 Ukraine war peace terms the US must put before NATO
    url: https://responsiblestatecraft.org/nato-summit/
    text: 'In the run up to the NATO Summit at The Hague next week, June 24-25, President
      Donald Trump and his administration should present a clear U.S. plan for peace
      in Ukraine to the European and Ukrainian governments — one that goes well beyond
      just a ceasefire.


      While it is understandable that Trump would like to walk away from the Ukraine
      peace process, given President Vladimir Putin’s intransigence and now the new
      war in the Middle East, he and his team need to state clearly the parameters of
      a deal that they think will bring a lasting peace. Walking away from the effort
      to end the war prematurely leaves Washington in continued danger of being drawn
      into a new crisis as long as the U.S. continues to supply Ukraine with weapons
      and intelligence.


      On the other hand, if Washington abandons the peace effort and stops helping Ukraine,
      that country’s defenses will be in acute danger of collapse.


      The Trump administration therefore needs to use the NATO summit to present Europe
      and Ukraine with the clear terms of what it regards as a reasonable and practicable
      peace settlement as the basis for negotiation with Russia. If Kyiv and Brussels
      accept, then these terms should be presented to Moscow, and if Moscow refuses
      to negotiate on this basis, then U.S. aid to Ukraine should continue unchanged.


      If however the Ukrainians and Europeans reject the proposed terms, then they should
      be told that their refusal will lead to an end to Washington’s support for Ukraine,
      and that if European countries wish to continue to support the war, they will
      have to do so on their own.


      This may seem a harsh approach, but in fact it will help the Ukrainian government.
      For even if leading Ukrainian officials now see that the conditions for peace
      that Ukraine has set are impossible to achieve, domestic political fears constrain
      them from changing course.


      This is common throughout history. France fought on for years in Indochina and
      Algeria after it was clear that no French victory was possible, because the French
      establishment was politically incapable of admitting this. The same was true of
      the U.S. in Vietnam. The only way that Ukrainian leaders can get away with accepting
      a compromise peace is if they can truthfully tell their own hardliners that Washington
      and NATO gave them no choice.


      The U.S. administration also needs to show the Russians what they have to gain
      from a settlement — and by the same token, what they would lose by rejecting it.
      If the Russian government rejects these terms as a basis for negotiation after
      Ukraine has accepted them, then U.S. aid to Ukraine should continue, until the
      Russians are prepared to compromise along these lines.


      The peace terms that the U.S. administration should put forward include the following:


      The ceasefire line should run along the line where the battlefront stands (with
      limited possibility for territorial swaps). Russia and Ukraine pledge not to try
      to change this line through force, subversion, or economic pressure. The legal
      status of all five oblasts (including the parts still held by Ukraine) to be subject
      to future negotiation under the auspices of the UN, and with reference to the
      wishes of local populations. Both sides pledge not to carry out terrorist attacks,
      subversion, and attempts to undermine sovereignty on each other’s territory (including
      Russian-occupied areas of Ukraine). All Western sanctions against Russia are suspended,
      with a snap-back proviso for violation. Russian assets held in Europe are paid
      into a UN fund for the reconstruction of Ukraine, to be split 50:50 between areas
      controlled by the Ukrainian government and Russia. Ukraine introduces guarantees
      for Russian linguistic and cultural rights into the constitution. Russia does
      the same for Ukrainians in Russia. Ukraine returns the principle of neutrality
      to the Ukrainian constitution and abandons its intention of joining NATO. NATO
      pledges no further enlargement, and the United States pledges to veto any proposed
      new candidates. Russia formally agrees to Ukraine’s EU accession, and EU promises
      to foster this. Russia recognizes Ukraine’s right of self-defense and abandons
      its demand for limits on size of the Ukrainian army. The U.S. pledges not to provide
      Ukraine with missiles, main battle tanks, or fighter aircraft. NATO countries
      pledge not to send troops to Ukraine; and peacekeepers are drawn from neutral
      countries under the authority of the UN. The U.S. pledges not to station U.S.
      troops in countries on Russia’s borders (including Romania), with a snap-back
      proviso that this pledge will be canceled if Russia attacks Ukraine again. The
      U.S. agrees not to station U.S. intermediate-range missiles in Germany in return
      for Russia’s withdrawal of its missiles from Kaliningrad and Belarus. The U.S.
      and Russia agree to enter into negotiations for a new START treaty. The UN Security
      Council creates a Committee on European Security made up of representatives of
      the five permanent members. If India and/or Brazil agree to send substantial numbers
      of peacekeepers to Ukraine, they will be added to this committee. In this case,
      Germany will also be added. The remit of this committee will be to discuss and
      propose solutions for actual, frozen and potential conflicts on the European continent,
      and to act as a mechanism for giving the international community early warning
      of possible impending crises.'
    one_sentence_summary: Ahead of the NATO Summit, the Trump administration should
      propose a comprehensive peace plan for Ukraine that outlines clear terms for negotiation
      with Russia, emphasizing the need for a ceasefire and mutual commitments, while
      also preparing to adjust U.S. support based on the responses from Ukraine and
      Europe.
    paragraph_summary: In anticipation of the NATO Summit in The Hague on June 24-25,
      the Trump administration is urged to present a comprehensive U.S. peace plan for
      Ukraine that extends beyond a mere ceasefire, addressing the complexities of the
      ongoing conflict with Russia. While Trump's inclination may be to disengage from
      the peace process due to Putin's obstinacy and new conflicts in the Middle East,
      a clear set of terms for negotiation must be articulated to both European and
      Ukrainian governments. This plan should include a ceasefire along current battle
      lines, future negotiations regarding territorial status, mutual pledges against
      aggression, and the suspension of sanctions against Russia contingent on compliance.
      The U.S. must also clarify that continued support for Ukraine hinges on the acceptance
      of these terms by Kyiv and Brussels, while outlining potential consequences for
      Russia should they refuse to negotiate. Ultimately, the proposal aims to facilitate
      a realistic path to peace while ensuring Ukraine's defense capabilities remain
      intact.

  - title: Europe's risky war on Russia's 'shadow fleet'
    url: https://responsiblestatecraft.org/russia-shadow-fleet/
    text: 'The European Union’s latest moves (as part of its 17th package of sanctions
      against Russia declared in May) to target much more intensively Russia’s so-called
      “shadow fleet” of oil tankers and other vessels illustrate the danger that, as
      long as the Ukraine war continues, so will the risk of an incident that will draw
      NATO and the EU into a direct military clash with Russia.


      The EU sanctions involve bans on access to the ports, national waters and maritime
      economic zones of EU states. Ships that enter these waters risk seizure and confiscation.
      It does not appear that Washington was consulted about this decision, despite
      the obvious risks to the U.S.


      As part of this strategy, on May 15, an Estonian patrol boat attempted to stop
      and inspect a tanker in the Gulf of Finland. Russia sent up a fighter jet that
      flew over the Estonian vessel (allegedly briefly trespassing into Estonian waters),
      and the Estonians backed off — this time. In January, the German navy seized a
      Panamanian-flagged tanker, the Eventin, in the Baltic after its engines failed
      and it drifted into German territorial waters.


      Sweden has now announced that starting on July 1 its navy will stop, inspect and
      potentially seize all suspect vessels transiting its exclusive economic zone,
      and is deploying the Swedish air force to back up this threat. Since the combined
      maritime economic zones of Sweden and the three Baltic states cover the whole
      of the central Baltic Sea, this amounts to a virtual threat to cut off all Russian
      trade exiting Russia via the Baltic — which would indeed be a very serious economic
      blow to Moscow.


      It would also threaten to cut off Russia’s exclave of Kaliningrad, which is surrounded
      by Poland, from access to Russia by sea.


      This is the kind of action that has traditionally led to war. The Swedish assumption
      seems to be that the Russian navy and air force in the Baltic are now so weak
      — and so surrounded by NATO territory — that there is nothing Moscow can do about
      this. However, it is very unlikely that the Swedes would take this step unless
      they also believe that in the event of a clash, Washington will come to Sweden’s
      defense — even though the EU and Swedish decisions were made without U.S. approval
      and are not strictly covered by NATO’s Article 5 commitment.


      And despite all the hysterical language about Russia being “at war” with NATO
      countries, these moves by the EU and Sweden are also based on an assumption that
      Russia will not in fact lose its temper and react with military force. European
      policymakers might however want to think about a number of things: for example,
      what would the U.S. do if ships carrying U.S. cargo were intercepted by foreign
      warships? We know perfectly well that the U.S. would blow the warships concerned
      out of the water and declare that it had done so in defense of the sacred rule
      of free navigation — in which the EU also professes to believe.


      EU leaders, and admirals, should also spend some time on Russian social media,
      and read the incessant attacks on the Putin administration by hardliners arguing
      precisely that Moscow has been far too soft and restrained in its response to
      Western provocations, and that this restraint has encouraged the West to escalate
      more and more. Such hardliners (especially within the security forces) are by
      far the greatest internal political threat that Putin faces.


      It is important to note in this regard that moves to damage Russia’s “shadow fleet”
      have not been restricted to sanctions. In recent months there have been a string
      of attacks on such vessels in the Mediterranean with limpet mines and other explosive
      devices — developments that have been virtually ignored by Western media.


      In December 2024, the Russian cargo ship Ursa Major sank off Libya after an explosion
      in which two crewmembers were killed. The Reuters headline reporting these attacks
      was rather characteristic: “Three tankers damaged by blasts in Mediterranean in
      the last month, causes unknown, sources say.” Unknown, really? Who do we think
      were the likely perpetrators? Laotian special forces? Martians? And what are European
      governments doing to investigate these causes?


      If the Russians do sink a Swedish or Estonian warship, the Trump administration
      will face a terribly difficult decision on how to respond to a crisis that is
      not of its own choosing: intervene and risk a direct war with Russia, or stand
      aside and ensure a deep crisis with Europe. The U.S. administration would therefore
      be both wise and entirely within its rights to state publicly that it does not
      endorse and will not help to enforce this decision.


      Washington also needs — finally — to pay attention to what the rest of the world
      thinks about all this. The overwhelming majority of senators who are proposing
      to impose 500% tariffs on any country that buys Russian energy have apparently
      not realized that one of the two biggest countries in this category is India —
      now universally regarded in Washington as a vital U.S. partner in Asia. And now
      America’s European allies are relying on U.S. support to seize ships providing
      that energy to India.


      The U.S. administration would also be wise to warn European countries that if
      this strategy leads to maritime clashes with Russia, they will have to deal with
      the consequences themselves. Especially given the new risk of war with Iran, the
      last thing Washington needs now is a new flare-up of tension with Moscow necessitating
      major U.S. military deployments to Europe. And the last thing the world economy
      needs are moves likely to lead to a still greater surge in world energy prices.


      European governments and establishments seem to have lost any ability to analyze
      the possible wider consequences of their actions. So — not for the first time
      — America will have to do their thinking for them.'
    one_sentence_summary: The European Union's intensified sanctions against Russia's
      "shadow fleet" of oil tankers, coupled with Sweden's plans to inspect and potentially
      seize suspect vessels, raise significant risks of direct military conflict with
      Russia, highlighting the need for U.S. involvement and caution in navigating these
      escalating tensions.
    paragraph_summary: The European Union's recent sanctions against Russia, particularly
      targeting its "shadow fleet" of oil tankers, heighten the risk of a direct military
      confrontation with Russia amid the ongoing Ukraine war. The sanctions include
      bans on access to EU ports and waters, with Sweden planning to inspect and potentially
      seize suspicious vessels in its exclusive economic zone, a move that could severely
      disrupt Russian trade and threaten its exclave of Kaliningrad. These actions,
      made without U.S. consultation, raise concerns about potential military escalation,
      especially if Russia reacts aggressively. The article suggests that European policymakers
      may be underestimating the risks involved, as hardliners in Russia could push
      for a more aggressive stance against perceived Western provocations. Additionally,
      the U.S. faces a dilemma in responding to any potential Russian military actions
      against European vessels, with implications for its relationships with both Europe
      and key partners like India. The author argues that the U.S. should clarify its
      stance on these European actions and consider the broader consequences of escalating
      tensions with Russia, especially given the current geopolitical climate.

  - title: Fresh Ukraine, Russia demands show no interest in actual peace
    url: https://responsiblestatecraft.org/ukraine-russia-memos/
    text: 'The memos presented by Ukraine and Russia at their direct talks in Istanbul
      on Monday make it absolutely clear that, absent a strong U.S. intervention based
      on a detailed U.S. peace plan, there will be no peace settlement in Ukraine.


      It is not just that several of the positions on both sides are completely mutually
      incompatible; they suggest that at present neither side is in fact interested
      in an early peace.


      The Ukrainian memo , presented before the talks, sets a “full and unconditional
      ceasefire in the sky, on land and at sea as a necessary background and prerequisite
      for peace negotiations.” Russia has already rejected this and will continue to
      do so — naturally, because it would mean giving up its main point of leverage
      for nothing in return. Nor indeed is a fragile and unstable ceasefire in the interests
      of Ukraine or the West. If Ukraine is to begin the extremely challenging process
      of economic reconstruction and democratic reform, it needs a stable and permanent
      peace.


      The Ukrainian memo also states that “no restrictions may be imposed on the number,
      deployment, or other parameters of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, as well as on
      the deployment of troops of friendly foreign states on the territory of Ukraine.”
      Russia has already stated that it will not under any circumstances accept the
      presence of Western troops in Ukraine since it sees this as NATO membership in
      all but name. European leaders have also stated that a European force could only
      be deployed with a U.S. guarantee of support, a condition which the Trump administration
      has rejected.


      The Ukrainian memo continues, “some sanctions may be lifted from Russia, but in
      stages and only gradually, with a mechanism for resuming sanctions if necessary
      (snapback). Frozen Russian sovereign assets are used for reconstruction or remain
      frozen until reparations are paid.” Moscow will obviously not agree to a final
      peace without the lifting of sanctions or firm assurances that they will be lifted.


      On one key point, the Ukrainian memo does leave room for compromise: “Ukraine
      is not forced to be neutral. It can choose to be part of the Euro-Atlantic community
      and move towards EU membership. Ukraine’s membership in NATO depends on consensus
      within the Alliance.” Russia has in fact already publicly stated that Ukraine
      has the sovereign right to seek EU membership. And on NATO membership, the memo
      is correct that this does not depend on Ukraine but on unanimous agreement (not
      merely “consensus”) among existing members.


      The Trump administration (or any European government) is therefore in a position
      to block Ukrainian NATO membership without reference to Kyiv. The problem for
      Moscow however is that Poland and other European members of NATO continue to declare
      their support for Ukraine’s membership; and, if the Democrats win the U.S. elections
      in 2028, they could overturn Trump’s veto. The Russians therefore are insisting
      on a Ukrainian constitutional commitment to neutrality and/or a U.S.-Russian treaty
      to that effect — which Kyiv is refusing.


      Meanwhile, accounts of the Russian memo presented in Istanbul, as reported by
      the Russian media, include reported conditions for a ceasefire that Moscow must
      know are totally unacceptable to the Ukrainians — though this does not in itself
      rule out the possibility of Russia being willing to compromise on some of them
      in a final settlement if it meets its goals in other areas — especially bilateral
      relations with Washington.


      They include “complete withdrawal of the Ukrainian Armed Forces from Donbas, Kherson
      and Zaporizhia regions. The second option for the ceasefire is a ban on major
      redeployments of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, the abolition of mobilization and
      martial law, and the cessation of supplies of foreign weapons.”


      This is not going to happen, absent Russian victory on the battlefield. Ukraine
      will never agree to surrender territory that it still holds, nor will European
      countries agree to end all weapons supplies.


      In return for a ceasefire, the Russian memo as reported calls for “international
      recognition of these regions and Crimea as part of Russia.” This is utterly pointless.
      It is not just that neither Ukraine nor Western countries will legally recognize
      the Russian annexations; China, India and South Africa have also refused this,
      and will continue to do so. The best that Russia can hope for (as was indeed provisionally
      agreed at the Istanbul talks in March 2022) is to defer the legal status of these
      territories for future negotiation.


      As part of an eventual peace settlement, Russia is also apparently demanding that:


      Kyiv must announce the date of the presidential and Rada elections, which must
      take place no later than 100 days after the lifting of martial law;


      The size of the Ukrainian military be limited;


      A legal ban on Nazi & neo-Nazi propaganda. Dissolution of "nationalist" parties
      & organizations;


      Restoration of rights of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church;


      A peace treaty between Russia and Ukraine must be approved by a legally binding
      resolution of the U.N. Security Council;


      It is necessary to ensure the full rights, freedoms and interests of Russian speakers;


      Renouncing mutual claims with Ukraine in connection with damage from military
      operations.


      Formal endorsement of the peace treaty by the UNSC makes very good sense. The
      other Russian conditions however will be exceptionally difficult for Kyiv to meet
      under Russian pressure — not least because in several cases they would need the
      legal approval of the Ukrainian parliament, which is very unlikely to give it.


      Only Washington can offer Russia compromises in other areas (for example on U.S.
      force deployments in Europe) that could persuade Moscow to reduce these conditions
      to reasonable levels; and only Washington could then pressure Kyiv and European
      capitals into accepting them. Some of the Russian conditions (including minority
      rights) are not only legitimate, but essential if postwar Ukraine is to progress
      towards eventual EU membership, but a formula has to be found whereby Ukraine
      can agree to them as a starting point of the EU accession process, and not as
      surrender to Moscow.


      The Trump administration can be forgiven its exasperation with the state of the
      peace process. Nonetheless, it would be a mistake — from the point of view of
      America’s own interests — for the U.S. to walk away from it. Apart from the fact
      that sooner or later Washington would inevitably be dragged back in, three recent
      developments have highlighted how a prolonged continuation of the war will involve
      serious risks for the U.S.


      Thus the weekend''s devastating Ukrainian attack on Russia’s nuclear-capable bomber
      fleet undermines nuclear security between the U.S. and Russia.


      The bipartisan bill to go before the U.S. Senate next week (with the encouragement
      of the EU presidency) proposes 500% tariffs on imports from countries that buy
      Russian oil and gas. Presumably the senators are thinking of China. They appear
      to have forgotten that it also means India (and other U.S. partners). India has
      no intention of bowing to a U.S. diktat that would radically increase its energy
      costs and undermine its economy; and the imposition of 500% tariffs on India would
      ruin a vital U.S. relationship in Asia.


      Finally, the EU has passed a new package of sanctions against Russia including
      measures to target the so-called “shadow fleet” of internationally-flagged tankers
      transporting Russian energy exports. This is also an affront to countries like
      India that buy this energy — and consider that they have a perfect right to do
      so under international law, since Western sanctions against Russia have not been
      approved by the United Nations, or agreed by themselves.


      Last month, an Estonian patrol boat attempted to board a tanker bound for Russia
      in international waters, and Moscow sent a fighter jet to warn the Estonians off.
      Finland and Sweden have also threatened to detain such ships. Russia in response
      briefly detained a Liberian-flagged Greek tanker exiting Estonia through Russian
      waters. Russian politicians have threatened retaliatory seizures: "Any attack
      on our carriers can be regarded as an attack on our territory, even if the ship
      is under a foreign flag," warned Alexei Zhuravlev, the deputy chairman of Russia''s
      parliamentary defense committee.


      If both sides stick to their positions, then naval clashes will be not only possible,
      but certain. It is also obvious that these NATO members would never engage in
      such wildly reckless behavior unless they believed that in the event of such clashes,
      the U.S. military would come to their aid. The Trump administration needs to rein
      them in very firmly indeed. It also however needs to continue trying to bring
      an end to the Ukraine War, for as long as the war continues, so will the danger
      of a local collision between Russia and NATO members, from which the U.S. will
      not be able to remain aloof.'
    one_sentence_summary: The memos exchanged between Ukraine and Russia during their
      talks in Istanbul reveal deep-seated incompatibilities in their positions, indicating
      that without significant U.S. intervention and a comprehensive peace plan, a resolution
      to the conflict is unlikely, as both sides seem disinterested in an immediate
      peace settlement.
    paragraph_summary: The recent talks in Istanbul between Ukraine and Russia reveal
      a stark lack of mutual interest in achieving peace, with both sides presenting
      incompatible positions that underscore the need for strong U.S. intervention based
      on a comprehensive peace plan. Ukraine demands a full ceasefire and the unrestricted
      presence of its armed forces, while Russia insists on conditions that include
      territorial concessions and the recognition of annexed regions, which Ukraine
      and its allies will not accept. The U.S. has the potential to mediate by offering
      compromises that could lead to a more reasonable negotiation framework, but current
      tensions, including military actions and proposed sanctions, threaten to escalate
      the conflict further. The article emphasizes that without U.S. involvement, the
      prospects for a peaceful resolution remain bleak, and ongoing hostilities could
      lead to dangerous confrontations between Russia and NATO members.

      of Ukraine, Russia, Europe, and the United States. A ceasefire is unlikely, unless
      the outlines of such a settlement are reached beforehand. A peace settlement must
      address Ukrainian fears of future Russian aggression while simultaneously laying
      out a broader political framework that assuages Russia’s fears of strategic encirclement
      and international isolation. A successful settlement is possible along these lines:
      In exchange for the West and Ukraine’s acknowledgement that Ukraine will not be
      part of the NATO alliance, Russia accepts Ukraine’s eventual E.U. accession, contingent
      on the constitutional enshrinement of rights for the Russian minority in Ukraine
      and Ukraine’s postwar upholding of the democratic process.


      Russia accepts a Western–armed, trained, and maintained Ukrainian military force
      capable of deterring and defending against any new invasion (accompanied possibly
      by a ban on Ukraine’s possession of long-range missiles). In return, the United
      States should enter into talks with Russia on a new version of the New Strategic
      Arms Treaty, New START, as well as committing to a new version of the Intermediate-Range
      Nuclear Forces Treaty, INF.


      The United Nations mandates a comprehensive reconstruction fund for Ukraine using
      frozen Russian assets held by the European Union, including reconstruction in
      the Russian–occupied areas of Ukraine.


      Ukraine and Russia accept a ceasefire along the current territorial battlelines,
      establishing a de facto border in the four provinces of eastern Ukraine that will
      not be further changed by force or subversion.


      Once a broader political settlement has been established, Ukraine, Russia, Europe,
      and the U.S. accept a U.N. peacekeeping and monitoring force drawn from neutral
      Global South countries, to adjudicate a ceasefire line. The process of reaching
      a settlement will not be easy or quick and may require the exercise of U.S. leverage
      over Russia, Ukraine, and Europe. But such an accord could create security and
      stability for Ukraine and Europe more broadly, while also enabling U.S.–Russian
      detente and an eventual American military drawdown from Europe. Absent such a
      settlement, the war will continue to the detriment of Ukraine, placing its standing
      as a sovereign state — and its future integration within the European Union —
      in jeopardy.


      Outline of a settlement


      Although the parties to the conflict in Ukraine are still far from reaching a
      detailed peace accord, the basic outlines of what a settlement must entail are
      apparent.


      Geopolitical compromise : The West and Kyiv agree that Ukraine will not be a part
      of NATO or host Western forces; in turn, Moscow agrees not to try to block Ukrainian
      accession to the European Union. Such a compromise would address Russia’s most
      significant security concern — that Ukraine might become a base that Western militaries
      could use against it. But this also would allow Kyiv a viable path toward its
      vital goal of becoming part of the West politically and economically.

      : No agreement will be possible absent Russia’s acceptance that Ukraine must have
      a significant military capable of deterring and defending against any new invasion,
      something that will be viable only with ongoing Western arms, training, and maintenance
      aid (though certain categories of weapons, like long-range missiles, could be
      excluded). But such acceptance is unlikely outside the context of a broader European
      arms control framework that addresses Moscow’s concerns about threats posed by
      NATO conventional and nuclear capabilities against Russia.

      NATO conventional and nuclear capabilities against Russia. E.U.–driven political
      reform in Ukraine : The political optics of accepting Russia’s demands to protect
      the linguistic and cultural rights of Ukraine’s Russian minority, defang what
      it regards as nationalist extremists, and hold new elections would be highly problematic
      for Kyiv (though Moscow could offer reciprocal protections for Ukrainian citizens
      of Russia). Ukraine would, however, have to address these issues as part of the
      E.U. membership process. Framing such reforms not as concessions to Russia, but
      as consequences of accession to the European Union, might be the only practical
      path toward resolving these sensitive issues.

      Ukraine and Russia need economic relief — Ukraine from the extreme financial and
      demographic duress of war; Russia from Western sanctions that, while not crippling
      to its economy, have nonetheless produced a discomfiting dependence on trade with
      China and the Global South. Because Ukraine lacks sufficient air defenses to prevent
      Russian missile and bomb strikes against nascent reconstruction projects, Kyiv
      is very unlikely to attract large-scale reconstruction aid without Moscow’s agreement
      to a settlement. And much of the West will object to any sanctions relief for
      Russia absent a peace accord.

      settlement on the fraught issue of delineating the border between Russia and Ukraine
      must be based on the recognition that neither side will cede territory it occupies
      at the time of settlement nor win new land at the negotiating table. But both
      sides should be able to agree that the de facto border will not be changed by
      force or subversion. The issue of the legal status of the territories concerned
      will have to be left for future negotiation.

      Assuming the basic provisions of a peace settlement are agreed, technical arrangements
      to establish, monitor, and adjudicate a ceasefire must be established. Any peacekeeping
      and monitoring force will, however, have to be drawn from neutral countries under
      the aegis of the United Nations.


      The procedural path to a settlement


      Because continuing the war is its primary leverage over the terms of a settlement,
      Russia will not agree to a ceasefire without a clear understanding of the key
      provisions of a peace accord. Ukraine, however, will not agree to those broad
      provisions absent strong assurances that Russia cannot exploit a ceasefire to
      regroup and reinvade, nor will Russia agree without assurances that “peacekeepers”
      from NATO countries will not be introduced later. For these reasons, a negotiating
      process that begins by trying to establish a ceasefire before securing the broad
      parameters of a political settlement is likely to fail.


      Although direct Russia–Ukraine talks can play a role in arranging a settlement,
      very few of the necessary compromises can be struck through bilateral negotiations
      alone. Absent U.S. and European support, Ukraine lacks the leverage to compel
      Russian compromises over its defense capabilities, and Kyiv cannot negotiate over
      such matters as the U.S. and European force posture within NATO, which are of
      critical concern to Moscow. The bulk of the incentive and coercive power that
      can produce Russian and Ukrainian concessions rests with Washington.


      To achieve an agreement, the U.S. administration needs to play a central role
      in formulating a detailed plan for peace, which all parties would have to agree
      to. Because Russia has the upper hand on the battlefield and views U.S. intentions
      and capabilities as its chief security concern, the most important channel of
      negotiation will be between Moscow and Washington. The Russians will almost certainly
      persist in their refusal to agree to a permanent ceasefire without a reasonably
      concrete and detailed agreement, as ending the fighting would end their ability
      to bring pressure on the Ukrainians and the West to accede to a compromise that
      meets basic Russian conditions.1


      Nor is an early ceasefire without a settlement objectively desirable, as it would
      leave open so many of the issues that have led to conflict since 2014, therefore
      increasing the chances of a renewal of the war.2An unstable and fragile ceasefire
      — such as existed in the Donbas from 2015 to 2022 — would not provide Ukraine
      with the stability and security it needs to attract foreign investment and implement
      the reforms necessary to move toward E.U. membership.


      U.S.–Russian agreement on the broad outlines of a political settlement could be
      followed by intense U.S. engagement with Ukraine to build support for a settlement
      and highlight the negative consequences that would almost inevitably flow from
      failure to settle the war. Bringing Ukraine around to accepting the key elements
      of a political settlement will require the United States to employ both honey
      and vinegar. An intense campaign of public diplomacy and direct engagement with
      Ukrainian political and business leaders will be necessary to persuade Ukrainians
      that prolonging the war would result in a more onerous settlement and that compromise
      now would secure Ukraine’s independence and anchor it in the West, even though
      NATO membership is unattainable.


      Ultimately, announced U.S. threats to cut off military and intelligence aid should
      Ukraine fail to compromise may be necessary. This may seem a harsh approach, but
      it may well be that it is only by being able to claim that President Volodymyr
      Zelensky has been forced to compromise by overwhelming U.S. pressure that he will
      be able to get hard-line elements in Ukraine — and in his own administration —
      to agree to a settlement, even if the alternative is far worse: defeat.


      European support will be critical to persuading Ukraine to accept a settlement.
      But the countries of the European Union (and Britain) are so deeply divided over
      policy toward the war in Ukraine that it seems likely only firm U.S. leadership
      can bring them to collective acceptance of a settlement. Leading figures in Brussels
      and elsewhere have also nailed themselves so firmly to rejection of compromise
      that it will be extremely difficult for them to change course, unless Washington
      shows them that they have no choice. In this regard, the United States will need
      to put considerable pressure on the Europeans to highlight the importance of supporting
      a viable path toward Ukrainian membership in the European Union, an issue on which
      intense U.S. lobbying with Poland, Hungary, and other skeptics will be necessary.


      U.S.–Russian relations as an incentive for compromise


      The greatest incentive for Russia to abandon or modify its maximalist demands
      on Ukraine and agree to a U.S. peace plan is the opportunity that it would give
      to establish a wholly new relationship with the United States, under which Washington
      would respect what Moscow sees as vital Russian interests and consult on issues
      of common concern. This is something that the administrations of Mikhail Gorbachev,
      Boris Yeltsin, and Vladimir Putin all sought in vain since the end of the Cold
      War. Between 2008 and 2011, it was also a core aim of President Dmitry Medvedev.3


      Beginning with these U.S.–Russian issues has the immense advantage that they can
      be negotiated bilaterally between Washington and Moscow and do not have to include
      consultation with (and likely obstruction from) Kyiv and other European capitals.
      Of course, however, any U.S. agreement to Russian wishes in this area must be
      made conditional on Russia’s willingness to compromise in its approach to Ukraine.
      Thus, Moscow has been demanding Ukrainian “disarmament” as part of a peace settlement,
      and previous Russian statements have suggested that this should involve reducing
      the Ukrainian armed forces to a level where they could not defend the country.


      This is completely unacceptable, and it is essential that in any settlement the
      United States and NATO should be able to continue to arm Ukraine for its defense.
      This would also reduce the pressure on the Europeans to engage in a crash rearmament
      program and on the Americans to retain large military forces in Europe. U.S. negotiators
      should give the Russian government a clear choice: Either Russia agrees to the
      Western arming of Ukraine for defense (possibly with the exclusion of certain
      categories of weapons, such as long-range missiles) or the United States will
      increase its own military deployments in Europe and help to arm NATO’s European
      members to the teeth. This would lock Russia into a long-term military competition
      with the West similar to the one that helped ruin the Soviet economy. The Russian
      economy has sustained the war in Ukraine remarkably well, but the strains (especially
      the threat of inflation) are nonetheless great, and it is unlikely that they can
      be sustained permanently.


      In return for the Russian government agreeing to long-term NATO aid in strengthening
      the Ukrainian armed forces, the Trump administration should urgently enter into
      talks on updating the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, or New START. The present
      treaty expires in 2026 and, unless something is created to replace it, there will
      be no legal limit on a nuclear arms race between the United States and Russia.
      Pending the signature of a new treaty, the United States and Russia should agree
      to state a willingness to abide by the terms of New START. Both countries should
      also formally commit themselves to negotiating a new version of the previous Intermediate-Range
      Nuclear Forces Treaty, or INF.4Under such an agreement, the United States could
      guarantee not to go through with its plan to deploy (nonnuclear but nuclear-capable)
      medium-range missiles in Germany, in return for Russia withdrawing its missiles
      from Kaliningrad and Belarus.5


      In December 2021, in its ultimatum before invading Ukraine, Russia demanded that
      NATO withdraw forces and weaponry deployed to new member states in eastern Europe
      since the end of the Cold War.6It will most likely be impossible to get many European
      countries to agree to this, but it is entirely within the rights and competence
      of a U.S. administration to decide that American forces will not be deployed there
      or, if they are there, that they can be withdrawn in return for reciprocal limits
      on Russian forces (notably in countries and territories on the borders of the
      NATO states concerned: Kaliningrad, Belarus, and Transdniestria).


      Such U.S. force limits or withdrawals would be very much in line with the Trump
      administration’s desire to reduce U.S. commitments in Europe and increase the
      role of European NATO members in their own defense. A U.S.–Russian agreement along
      these lines would not fully satisfy Russia, because European NATO members would
      still be free to deploy their own troops; but Russia’s fears of NATO on its borders
      have always focused above all on U.S. forces.


      Agreement on these issues could be accompanied or followed by the restoration
      of previous U.S.–Russian cooperation in other areas: on counterterrorism in response
      to what remains a dire threat to both the West and Russia; on the maintenance
      of stability in the Middle East and Russian help with a new Iranian nuclear deal,
      if the Trump administration genuinely wants one; and on limiting military deployments
      and confrontation in the Arctic. The United States should also promote a full
      restoration of Russia’s role in the Arctic Council and the restoration of what
      was called “Arctic Exceptionalism.”


      A much more complex issue is Russia’s demand for a new European security architecture,
      or consultation mechanism, which would end the NATO and E.U. attempt to monopolize
      security on the European continent, officially recognizing the role and droit
      de regard of Russia. This was something that was supposed to be established either
      under the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, OSCE, or through
      the NATO–Russia Council.7But from Moscow’s point of view, both institutions have
      been hopelessly compromised by the tendency of all the Western members to decide
      things on their own and then present Russia not with material for discussion but
      with a fait accompli.


      However, any purely European consultative mechanism is inevitably going to mean
      that Russia is outnumbered by Western states and institutions. If, therefore,
      an eventual Ukrainian peace settlement is signed under the auspices of the United
      Nations and involves U.N. peacekeeping forces to patrol the ceasefire line and
      any demilitarized zone (and it is clear that only neutral U.N. forces in this
      role will be acceptable to Russia), then it might be worth considering the possibility
      of creating a committee of the U.N. Security Council on Ukrainian and European
      security, with the additional statutory membership of any nonpermanent Security
      Council members that contribute significant numbers of troops to a peacekeeping
      force or funds for Ukraine’s reconstruction.


      Territorial issues


      Realistically speaking, and as President Zelensky has himself stated, the Ukrainian
      military is not in a position to recapture the territories already lost to Russia.8Nor
      is there any chance in the foreseeable future that it will be able to regain them
      through negotiations. If the war continues, the Russian military is very likely
      to make additional gains, but to what extent and how quickly is not at all clear.


      On the one hand, the advantage that contemporary weaponry gives to the defense
      has meant that, over the past year, the Russian army has advanced only very slowly
      and at the cost of heavy casualties.9On the other hand, there has been extensive
      reporting in the Western media of heavy Ukrainian casualties, of exhaustion and
      demoralization among Ukraine’s frontline troops, and of resistance to conscription
      in the Ukrainian population.10There is therefore a real risk that the Ukrainian
      front will collapse at some point. Russia would then be able to make far greater
      gains and dictate the terms of peace, subjugating Ukraine and causing considerable
      embarrassment to the United States.


      If the war continues indefinitely and complete Ukrainian defeat is to be avoided,
      then present levels of U.S. military aid and intelligence sharing will also have
      to continue indefinitely. This would impose a heavy burden on limited reserves
      of U.S. weaponry and be very unwelcome to the present U.S. administration and
      many U.S. citizens. In terms of preventing Ukrainian defeat, U.S. intelligence
      is even more important than weaponry. Satellite intelligence identifies the location
      of Russian troops. Terrain mapping allows Ukrainian missiles to hit their targets.
      Starlink is essential for communication between Ukrainian units.11


      On the question of territory, at the time of writing, the official Russian position
      remains that, in return for a permanent ceasefire, Ukraine must withdraw from
      all the land it still holds in the provinces Russia claims to have annexed, including
      the cities of Kherson and Zaporizhia (though there have been hints that Russia
      is ready to give up this demand as part of a peace settlement).12This would be
      completely impossible for any Ukrainian government to accept, and the Trump administration
      has quite rightly advocated in its draft peace terms that the ceasefire line will
      therefore have to run where the final battle line runs.13


      Nor, barring complete Ukrainian defeat, can any Ukrainian government agree legally
      to recognize Russian sovereignty over occupied territories.14It is possible however
      — as suggested in the draft peace proposals issued by the Trump administration
      — that the United States could do so, at least in the case of Crimea, which is
      a special case, having been transferred from the Russian Soviet Republic to the
      Ukrainian Soviet Republic by a 1954 Soviet decree.15Russia and Ukraine will therefore
      need to agree that the legal status of occupied territories will be deferred for
      future negotiation and that neither will try to change the ceasefire line through
      force, subversion, or economic pressure. The likelihood in this case is that,
      as in the case of the de facto partition of Cyprus, talks will go on for decades
      or generations without resolution — but also, hopefully, without a return to war.


      Neutrality, Ukrainian self-defense, and the search for security guarantees


      In practice, a bar on Ukrainian NATO membership has already been conceded by the
      West, because every leading NATO government (including the Biden administration)
      has made clear that they will not fight to defend Ukraine.16This, by definition,
      rules out a NATO Article 5 guarantee for Ukraine. As President Zelensky himself
      stated publicly in March 2022, all the NATO governments he had talked to prior
      to the war had refused to promise that within five years Ukraine would be admitted
      to the organization. He therefore said that Ukrainian neutrality (which until
      2014 was part of the Ukrainian constitution) could be accepted by Kyiv, if ratified
      in a referendum and accompanied by other guarantees to Ukraine.17


      By the same token, a European “reassurance force” for Ukraine is impossible.18Russia
      categorically opposes any military force from NATO members in Ukraine, and there
      is a strong likelihood that if they were deployed — even in areas far from the
      front line — they would be attacked.19Assessments by European military analysts
      and retired officers have stated that Britain and France can only provide a small
      fraction of the troops necessary to create a force capable of fighting Russia
      in Ukraine if necessary.20


      Most European states (including Poland) have therefore already refused to contribute
      troops to such a force.21The British government — one of the proposal’s leading
      advocates and one of the few European states with serious armed forces — has said
      that this can only be formed if there is a U.S. “backstop.”22This suggests a U.S.
      commitment to go to war with Russia over Ukraine, which is completely contrary
      to Trump administration policy, U.S. vital interests, and the wishes of a majority
      of U.S. citizens.


      The deployment of such a force would also create a real risk that, at some point
      in the future, a Ukrainian government — or Ukrainian extremist forces — might
      deliberately restart a war with Russia in an effort to draw the United States
      in; for any realistic peace settlement will be bitterly unpopular with many Ukrainians,
      and so threats to a long-term peace settlement do not come only from the Russian
      side. The Trump administration has therefore been correct to be very cautious
      about offering help for such a European force.


      When considering alternative security “guarantees” to Ukraine, it is crucial to
      honestly recognize that, in international affairs and over the long term, no such
      absolute guarantees can exist. As long as Russia exists as a state, a potential
      threat to Ukraine will also exist (and, as long as Ukraine exists as a state,
      it will probably wish to recover its lost territories); but destroying Russia
      as a state is not remotely within Western capacity and would, in any case, involve
      a hideous risk of mutual nuclear annihilation and the end of civilization.


      Nor is any geopolitical alignment set in stone. In 1814, Great Britain was an
      ally of the German states (and Russia) against France. One hundred years later,
      it was an ally of France (and Russia) against Germany. One hundred and fifty years
      later, it was an ally of France (and Germany) against Russia. The British government’s
      language of a “100-year pact” between Britain and Ukraine is therefore meaningless.23


      In consequence, the task of the U.S. administration and its European allies should
      be not to fantasize about absolute or permanent guarantees to Ukraine. Instead,
      they should craft a peace settlement that both Moscow and Kyiv can live with (however
      unhappily), with the right mixture of incentives and deterrents to make a resumption
      of the war by either side as unlikely as possible.


      In any peace settlement, Ukraine must therefore keep the right to maintain sufficiently
      strong armed forces that, in the event of new Russian aggression, would be able
      to put up a serious defense, inflict heavy casualties, and buy time for the massive
      supply of Western weaponry (as indeed they did in the months following the Russian
      invasion in Feb. 2022). Western governments should stockpile weaponry to supply
      to Ukraine in the event of new Russian aggression and should let Moscow know of
      this.


      Any limitations on the numbers of Ukrainian troops should only be considered as
      part of a separate process introducing general and reciprocal limits of armed
      forces in Europe as a whole, based on (though inevitably different from, given
      the radically changed circumstances) the previous Adapted Conventional Forces
      in Europe Treaty, CFE.24


      Russia’s demand for the “demilitarization” of Ukraine should therefore be quite
      unacceptable as it stands. However, the U.S. administration could consider a ban
      on the delivery of or help in producing certain categories of weapons to Ukraine,
      notably long-range missiles capable of striking deep into Russian territory. Thus,
      Article 13 of the Austrian State Treaty of 1955, by which the Soviet Union and
      NATO agreed to withdraw their occupying troops from Austria and establish Austrian
      neutrality, prohibited Austria from possessing missiles and artillery with a range
      of over 30 kilometers.25


      Fortunately, recent developments in military technology (especially drones) strongly
      favor defense and mean that it will be possible for Ukraine, with Western assistance,
      to build up defensive forces capable of deterring future Russian aggression by
      denying Russia a quick victory and ensuring heavy Russian casualties.26


      The supply of such weapons to Ukraine must remain open in any settlement, and
      it should be formally guaranteed that the supply of all forms of Western weaponry
      will automatically resume in the event of future Russian aggression. Ukraine should,
      however, also be warned that, if it breaks the terms of a peace settlement, weapons
      and intelligence support will not be provided, ensuring defeat. This should apply,
      for example, if a future Ukrainian government allows or encourages terrorism against
      Russian targets by groups based in Ukraine.


      As for peacekeepers, the only ones acceptable to both Russia and Ukraine would
      have to be organized under the United Nations and drawn from countries that have
      remained neutral in the Ukraine War.27 Ideally, these should be important states
      of the Global South.


      Such troops could not and would not be intended to defeat a new Russian (or Ukrainian)
      offensive. However, before and especially during the war, Moscow has devoted immense
      diplomatic effort to wooing the members of what it calls the “Global Majority.”28Moreover,
      while these states have refused to join in Western sanctions against Russia, they
      certainly did not want the war and would not want to see it resume.


      It is therefore reasonable to assume that Russia would hesitate to launch an attack
      in which peacekeepers would be at risk of being killed, which would deeply alienate
      their governments. Given the importance that Russia attaches to the United Nations
      and its permanent seat on the U.N. Security Council, a Ukrainian peace treaty
      signed under U.N. auspices and mandating U.N. peacekeepers would also carry more
      moral and political weight in Moscow than one signed simply between Russia, Ukraine,
      and Western states.


      Sanctions and economic agreements


      Economic incentives and deterrents regarding both Russia and Ukraine will be of
      key importance in achieving a settlement. A good start has been made with the
      U.S.–Ukraine agreement on minerals development, which, if implemented, will ensure
      long-term U.S. interest in Ukraine and that, in the event of new Russian aggression,
      a future U.S. administration will not be able simply to ignore Ukraine.29


      Economic issues cannot, however, be negotiated purely between Washington and Moscow,
      because the European Union plays a key role both in sanctions against Russia and
      through its control of $300 billion in sequestered Russian assets. Nonetheless,
      the U.S. administration can make very strong recommendations to the Europeans
      on how to proceed and threaten withdrawal of U.S. military aid to Ukraine and
      reduction of its commitment to Europe if they reject these recommendations.


      A strong incentive to Russia to make and stick to a peace settlement would be
      the lifting of Western sanctions. Though these have done far less damage to the
      Russian economy than Western governments hoped — and have in some ways even strengthened
      it (through the need to build up substitutes for Western imports) — the reduction
      in Western energy imports from Russia has made Russia much more dependent on energy
      exports to China, thereby allowing Beijing to set prices to Moscow’s disadvantage.30


      However, as part of a settlement Western sanctions should be not ended but suspended,
      with — as in the 2015 nuclear agreement with Iran — a “snapback” clause that guarantees
      that they would automatically resume if Russia launched a new attack on Ukraine.
      President Putin authorized the full invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 because
      he thought Russia could easily win a complete victory. After the experience of
      the past three years, he cannot possibly expect such an outcome in the future.


      The Russian assets held by the European Union (in fact, mainly by Belgium) should
      go to the reconstruction of Ukraine. Russian agreement to this could be gained
      by two means: a face-saving agreement whereby Russian assets would go into a joint
      fund for Ukrainian reconstruction under the United Nations, which the European
      Union would also contribute to; and a proviso that the fund would also pay for
      reconstruction in the Russian–occupied areas of Ukraine, which have also suffered
      very badly since 2022, and in the case of the Donbas since 2014.


      The E.U. contribution to this U.N. fund would also form part of the process of
      helping Ukraine move toward eventual membership in the European Union — a possibility
      that Russia has agreed to and that should form an explicit part of any peace settlement.
      Whether Ukraine will be capable of joining the European Union in anything like
      the union’s present form is of course questionable; but the economic and political
      reforms that Ukraine will be required to undertake as part of the E.U. accession
      process would be beneficial in and of themselves and, if implemented, would contribute
      greatly to the country’s move toward the West — much more so than a NATO accession
      process that is, in any case, impossible.


      Minority rights and internal governance


      The path toward E.U. membership also provides a way for Ukraine to guarantee the
      linguistic and cultural rights of the country’s Russian minority without seeming
      to bow to Moscow’s demands for “denazification,” since these rights are guaranteed
      under principles of the E.U. Charter of Fundamental Rights, which Kyiv will have
      to accede to in order to qualify for membership.31


      The official status of the Russian language and Ukrainian Russians as a national
      minority should be established in the Ukrainian constitution. However, as reportedly
      discussed in the Istanbul peace negotiations early in the war, this should also
      form part of a mutual agreement whereby Russia guarantees Ukrainian–language rights
      to Ukrainians in Russia.


      Ukraine will, of course, have to hold democratic elections as part of the E.U.
      accession process; and, while these would likely not bring a pro–Russian government
      to power, it is possible that they would lead to the replacement of President
      Zelensky, perhaps by a figure more inclined to compromise with Russia. Many E.U.
      states also have laws banning neo–Nazi parties and symbols, which could be adopted
      by Ukraine as part of its strategy of joining the European Union. The union should
      insist on similar laws in Ukraine as part of the E.U. accession process.


      As part of any settlement, Russia must guarantee noninterference in the internal
      affairs of Ukraine (including a specific ban on support for insurrection, as occurred
      in the Donbas in 2014) and respect for Ukrainian elections and Ukrainian democratic
      legitimacy. In return, Ukraine should guarantee not to foment rebellion or support
      terrorism against Russia in the Russian–controlled areas of Ukraine or in Russia
      itself. This is a crucially important part of any peace settlement that has been
      almost completely neglected in the West.


      Since 2014, Ukraine has engaged in the assassination of pro–Russian officials
      and leaders in occupied areas of Ukraine and, since the Russian invasion of 2022,
      has greatly intensified this strategy and extended it to Russia itself.32Should
      such attacks continue after a peace settlement, whether by the Ukrainian state
      itself or by Ukrainian nationalist groups, this would create a huge danger that
      Russia would resume the war and might even have widespread global sympathy in
      doing so, given the fear of terrorism that exists in most countries around the
      world.


      The example of the threat of war between India and Pakistan caused by terrorist
      attacks on India should be very clear before our eyes; and indeed, were Pakistan
      not armed with nuclear weapons, it seems highly likely that India would have invaded
      Pakistan in response to these attacks. On the other hand, if Ukraine has a realistic
      path toward E.U. membership, this would inhibit Kyiv from engaging in or turning
      a blind eye to such attacks, for the resulting instability and danger of new war
      with Moscow would undoubtedly create a huge barrier to progress toward membership.


      Conclusion


      A peace settlement along these lines would meet the vital interests of Ukraine,
      Russia, Europe, and the United States. Ukraine would receive all realistic and
      practicable guarantees against future Russian aggression, the chance to move toward
      E.U. membership (which would itself be a major deterrent to Russia), and large
      funds for reconstruction. Russia would be guaranteed against Ukraine becoming
      a Western military springboard against it, and it would be able to reestablish
      normal economic relations with the West, thereby allowing it to recover from damage
      to its economy and to escape dependence on China.


      Europe would no longer be faced with the terrifying danger of having to continue
      to back Ukraine in a war without help or guarantees from the United States. Washington
      would escape the risk of being drawn into a potentially catastrophic clash with
      Moscow against its will. It would be free to gradually reduce some of its military
      deployments to Europe and to concentrate its resources and attention on other
      issues of greater concern to the American people.


      In its negotiations with Moscow, the Trump administration will need to aim at
      agreement on reasonably firm and concrete points, because the Russians feel that,
      under previous U.S. administrations, American professions of goodwill led nowhere
      and promises not backed by formal agreements were empty. If Russia rejects these
      points, then the war will obviously continue and so should U.S. aid to Ukraine.


      The aim of this aid should not be — as under the Biden administration — Ukrainian
      “victory” but rather to change the cost-benefit analysis in Moscow, by inflicting
      such losses on Russia that accepting a reasonable compromise will seem preferable
      to continuing to suffer them in pursuit of maximalist gains that may be unachievable.
      The very slow progress and heavy casualties of the Russian army over the past
      year, and the increasing threat of inflation in the domestic economy, suggest
      that this strategy has a good chance of working — but only if continued aid to
      Kyiv is combined with a continued offer to Moscow of a reasonable compromise.


      If an agreement on these points with Russia can be reached, then it should be
      presented to Ukraine and European countries as a settled matter that they can
      either accept (with limited modifications) or reject — with the clear warning
      that, if they reject it, U.S. aid and intelligence-sharing will be withdrawn and
      U.S. military commitments in Europe reduced.


      The Europeans would be forced to recognize the need to strengthen their own security
      and not adopt empty ideas (like a “reassurance force” for Ukraine) that depend
      completely on U.S. backing. As for President Zelensky, it seems likely that the
      only way that he will be able to get the Ukrainian political establishment to
      agree to a compromise peace is if he can present this as a fait accompli forced
      on him by Washington, which he has no choice but to accept.


      And failing such a settlement, the war will continue, and to Ukraine’s disadvantage.
      Even if U.S. aid continues and complete collapse can be avoided, Ukraine will
      continue to be devastated, its male population decimated, and the day when it
      can begin to reconstruct and move toward the European Union indefinitely delayed.
      In pushing for an early settlement, the Trump administration is therefore acting
      as a true friend of Ukraine.'

  - title: Back to Istanbul! Key nodes for US-Russia-Ukraine talks
    url: https://responsiblestatecraft.org/ukraine-russia-talks-istanbul/
    text: 'Direct talks between senior Ukrainian and Russian representatives, if they
      do take place in Istanbul on Thursday, will be a real step forward and a significant
      achievement by the Trump administration.


      It is worth remembering that only three months ago the Ukrainian government was
      still rejecting even the idea of talks with the Putin administration as illegal,
      and demanding prior Russian withdrawal from all the occupied areas of Ukraine
      as a precondition for negotiations.


      Putin’s apparent rejection of Zelensky’s challenge to a face to face meeting is
      a disappointment, but not a crucial setback. It is very rare for real progress
      in peace talks to be made in meetings between leaders themselves, and the Russians
      have some reason to see this as a maneuver, or stunt, by Zelensky to gain Trump’s
      favor rather than a serious proposal.


      Normally, before leaders meet there have to be long and detailed negotiations
      by officials to lay the groundwork for agreement. Hopefully, the Istanbul meeting
      of officials proposed by Moscow will advance that process, whereas a public shouting-match
      between Putin and Zelensky could set it back.


      The Ukrainian and European governments have stated that Moscow’s rejection of
      a 30-day ceasefire shows that “Putin is not interested in peace”, but this is
      disingenuous. Russia’s ability to advance — even if slowly — on the battlefield
      is Moscow’s main source of leverage in negotiations, and it is not going to give
      that up unless substantial agreement has already been reached.


      Nor, and for the same reason, were Western countries ever going to agree to Russia’s
      demand for a complete and permanent end to military supplies to Ukraine as the
      precondition of a ceasefire. We have to accept that while the talks continue,
      so will the fighting. That should be a spur to efforts to move as quickly as possible
      to a comprehensive settlement.


      And a comprehensive settlement is what we should be aiming at. Even if Russia
      could be brought to agree to a long-term ceasefire, absent a settlement, such
      a ceasefire would resemble that in the Donbas from 2014-22: deeply unstable, constantly
      interrupted by clashes and exchanges of fire, and at permanent risk of collapsing
      back into full scale war.


      This situation would make Ukraine’s economic development and progress towards
      the European Union virtually impossible, both because it would prevent Western
      investment and because it would mean that Ukraine remains a highly militarized
      and semi-authoritarian society permanently mobilized for war.


      It would also make it far more difficult for the U.S. to reduce its military presence
      in Europe so as to concentrate resources elsewhere - which is indeed probably
      a key motive for the European approach.


      Trump’s threat to “walk away” from the peace process has succeeded in bringing
      both sides to the negotiating table, but they agreed only so as to avoid being
      blamed by him for refusal. On key issues, the Russian and Ukrainian positions
      remain quite far apart, and it will be a miracle if one round of direct talks
      in Istanbul is able to bring them together. Continued U.S. engagement in the peace
      process therefore seems essential.


      For Washington’s involvement to be effective, it will have to set out concrete
      and detailed conditions for agreement and bring both pressure and incentives to
      bear on both sides to accept them. A U.S. incentive to the Ukrainian side has
      already been established in the form of the the minerals deal and its promise
      that long-term American economic engagement in Ukraine will also ensure Washignton’s
      interest in maintaining Ukrainian security.


      For Russia, the Trump administration has a huge potential incentive in the form
      of a new U.S.-Russian relationship, and an end to Washington pressure on what
      the Russians see as their vital interests.


      Some of the elements of an agreement between Ukraine and Russia were laid down
      at the talks in Istanbul in March 2022, and are still applicable. Conditions meeting
      the vital interests of both sides, and on which the U.S. could help them to agree,
      include the following: that the ceasefire line runs where the battle line eventually
      runs, and neither side can be asked to withdraw further; that both sides should
      promise not to try to change the ceasefire line through force, subversion or economic
      pressure; that the issue or the legal status of the occupied territory should
      be left for future negotiation and that NATO membership for Ukraine should be
      excluded, but that Ukraine should be guaranteed the right to seek membership of
      the EU.


      Conditions also included that no NATO troops should be deployed in Ukraine, and
      any peacekeeping force should be from neutral countries under UN auspices; that
      the UN should guarantee the sovereignty and independence of Ukraine; that both
      sides should guarantee linguistic and cultural rights of minorities; that Western
      sanctions against Russia should be suspended, but with a “snap-back” clause guaranteeing
      that they would automatically resume in the event of new Russian aggression; that
      any limits on Ukrainian armaments should be restricted to long-range missiles,
      and that the West should be able to go on arming Ukraine for defense.


      A settlement along these lines would leave both sides unhappy — but hopefully,
      not so unhappy that they would be willing to take on dreadful the risks and costs
      of a return to war. We may hope that — to adapt President Lincoln’s words — the
      “better angels” of the Russian and Ukrainian negotiators’ natures will incline
      them to such compromises at their talks in Istanbul this week. If not, and however
      incongruous this partnership may seem to many, it will be for the Trump administration
      to give the angels a helping wing.'
    one_sentence_summary: Direct talks between Ukrainian and Russian representatives
      in Istanbul could mark a significant step forward in the peace process, despite
      remaining deep divisions and the ongoing conflict, with the Trump administration's

    paragraph_summary: The article discusses the potential significance of direct talks
      between Ukrainian and Russian representatives in Istanbul, which could mark a
      notable achievement for the Trump administration, especially given Ukraine's previous
      refusal to engage in negotiations without Russian withdrawal from occupied territories.
      While Putin's rejection of a face-to-face meeting with Zelensky is disappointing,
      it is not seen as a major setback, as substantial progress typically requires
      groundwork laid by officials. The article emphasizes that ongoing fighting is
      likely to continue during negotiations, and a comprehensive settlement is essential
      to avoid a fragile ceasefire similar to the one in Donbas from 2014-2022. It outlines
      potential conditions for an agreement that could satisfy both sides, including
      guarantees on territorial integrity, NATO membership, and cultural rights, while
      also suggesting that U.S. involvement is crucial for effective mediation. Ultimately,
      the hope is that both parties will be compelled to compromise to avoid the dire
      consequences of renewed conflict.

  - title: 'US, Ukraine minerals deal: A tactical win, not a turning point'
    url: https://responsiblestatecraft.org/ukraine-war-2671878344/
    text: 'The U.S.-Ukraine minerals agreement is not a diplomatic breakthrough and
      will not end the war, but it is a significant success for Ukraine, both in the
      short term and — if it is ever in fact implemented — in the longer term.


      It reportedly does not get Ukraine the security “guarantees” that Kyiv has been
      asking for. It does not commit the U.S. to fight for Ukraine, or to back up a
      European “reassurance force” for Ukraine. And NATO membership remains off the
      table. Given its basic positions, there is no chance of the Trump administration
      shifting on these points.


      But since the Ukraine peace process appeared to run out of steam, and Trump threatened
      to “walk away” from the talks, Kyiv and Moscow have been engaged in an elaborate
      diplomatic dance of semi-proposals and hints to try to ensure that if Trump does
      walk away, he will blame the other side for the talks’ failure.


      This agreement makes it far more likely that he will blame Russia, and therefore
      that he will continue military and intelligence aid to Ukraine. He may also, as
      threatened, try to impose additional sanctions on Russia — though given the resistance
      of most of the world to these sanctions, and tensions over tariffs between the
      U.S. and Europe, it is not at all clear how effective new sanctions would be.


      Continued U.S. military and intelligence aid will not win the war for Ukraine,
      nor allow it to drive the Russians from occupied territory. It will however help
      the Ukrainian army to slow down Russia’s advance on the ground and impose heavy
      casualties on the Russian army. This should not be taken by the Ukrainians or
      their European supporters as an excuse to maintain impossible conditions for peace
      that will make a settlement impossible; because the military and economic odds
      are still strongly against Ukraine, and a collapse of Ukraine’s exhausted troops
      is a real possibility.


      However, it will make it more likely that Russia will abandon or heavily qualify
      its impossible demands, for example for Ukrainian disarmament and withdrawal from
      additional territory.


      As far as the deal itself is concerned, it is clearly far more favorable for Ukraine
      than Trump’s original — and grotesque — proposal that Ukraine should essentially
      hand its entire reserves of minerals to the U.S. in compensation for U.S. aid.
      Under the new agreement, the profits of mineral extraction will be equally shared.


      As Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said : “This agreement signals clearly to
      Russia that the Trump administration is committed to a peace process centered
      on a free, sovereign, and prosperous Ukraine over the long term. … President Trump
      envisioned this partnership between the American people and the Ukrainian people
      to show both sides’ commitment to lasting peace and prosperity in Ukraine. And
      to be clear, no state or person who financed or supplied the Russian war machine
      will be allowed to benefit from the reconstruction of Ukraine.”


      Nor under this deal will any U.S. money go to develop mineral extraction in the
      Russian-occupied areas of Ukraine.


      According to Trump, “The American presence will, I think, keep a lot of bad actors
      out of the country or certainly out of the area where we’re doing the digging."


      Despite Western rhetoric, absolute Western security guarantees for Ukraine after
      a peace settlement have never really been on offer, because the Biden administration
      and almost every other NATO government stated repeatedly that they would not fight
      to defend Ukraine. This deal, if implemented, will however ensure a strong continued
      U.S. interest in Ukraine. It greatly reduces the risk that in the event of future
      Russian aggression, the U.S. would simply look away and not respond as it has
      in this war, with military supplies and extreme sanctions.


      But the deal won’t be implemented until the war comes to an end. Thereafter, it
      will depend on the willingness of U.S. private companies to invest in this sector
      — and that will depend on their assessment of both the risks and the profits involved.
      For it is vital to note that this agreement does not commit the U.S. government
      to invest in Ukraine; and to judge by the present profitability of minerals extraction
      in the world, it is not certain that private investors will see major benefits
      from doing so.


      China has developed its rare-earth sector on such a scale mainly through huge
      state-directed investment; and no-one has so far done a thorough analysis of the
      actual profitability and scale of most of these Ukrainian resources. So, only
      a tactical success for Ukraine and one over which there hang many questions; but
      nonetheless one that hopefully will lead Moscow to respond with some serious and
      acceptable peace proposals of its own.'
    one_sentence_summary: The U.S.-Ukraine minerals agreement, while not a diplomatic
      breakthrough or a solution to the ongoing war, represents a tactical success for
      Ukraine by potentially ensuring continued U.S. military aid and a more favorable
      economic partnership, although its implementation remains uncertain and contingent
      on the war's resolution.
    paragraph_summary: The recent U.S.-Ukraine minerals agreement, while not a diplomatic
      breakthrough or a resolution to the ongoing war, represents a significant short-term
      success for Ukraine and could have longer-term implications if implemented. The
      agreement does not provide the security guarantees Ukraine has sought, nor does
      it commit the U.S. to military intervention or NATO membership, especially under
      the Trump administration. However, it is designed to keep U.S. military and intelligence
      support flowing to Ukraine, potentially increasing pressure on Russia to moderate
      its demands in peace negotiations. The deal improves upon Trump's earlier proposal
      by ensuring a more equitable sharing of profits from mineral extraction, signaling
      U.S. commitment to Ukraine's sovereignty and prosperity. Despite the agreement's
      potential benefits, its implementation hinges on the war's conclusion and the
      willingness of U.S. private companies to invest, which remains uncertain due to
      risks and profitability concerns. Overall, while the agreement is a tactical win
      for Ukraine, it raises questions about future peace proposals from Russia and
      the viability of U.S. investment in the region.

    url: https://quincyinst.org/research/peace-through-strength-in-ukraine-sources-of-u-s-leverage-in-negotiations/
    text: 'Executive Summary The key to American success in ending the war in Ukraine
      is to broaden, rather than narrow, the issues under negotiation. If American negotiators
      treat the war as a bilateral dispute between Russia and Ukraine and press both
      sides to agree to an immediate ceasefire, they are likely to fail. In a narrow
      negotiation, Russia has significant advantages because it has turned the conflict
      into a war of attrition in which its much greater population and much larger military
      industry are overwhelming Ukraine’s defenses. The United States and Europe lack
      the capacity to match Russia’s arms production or bridge the Russia–Ukraine manpower
      gap without direct conflict with Russia. By contrast, if Washington recognizes
      that Moscow’s security concerns extend beyond Ukraine to the broader military
      threat posed by U.S. and NATO forces in Europe — a threat Russia cannot blunt
      by conquering Ukraine — the U.S. can employ leverage that Kyiv lacks in direct
      bargaining with Moscow. Key Takeaways: The United States can expand or constrain
      its force posture in Europe depending on Russia’s willingness to compromise over
      Ukraine.


      The prospect of Russia’s return to Western diplomatic forums would accord with
      its self-image as a great power, provide it with a voice in a region it sees as
      vital to its security, and decrease its dependence on China. The first small step
      toward greater Russian inclusion would be a direct summit meeting between the
      U.S. and Russian presidents, but this should be offered only as an incentive for
      genuine progress toward ending the war in Ukraine.


      Sanctions relief is a key incentive to make a settlement stick. For Moscow to
      have a stake in peace, it must see benefits in compliance as well as the costs
      of violating settlement provisions. These positive and negative incentives are
      best captured through the conditional suspension of specific sanctions, as opposed
      to their unconditional removal.


      Inviting China’s special envoy on Ukraine to visit the United States and discuss
      a settlement — something Beijing sought but former President Biden refused to
      offer — would put pressure on President Vladimir Putin. A significant Chinese
      role in a postaccord reconstruction of Ukraine would both give China a stake in
      preserving peace and serve as a powerful disincentive for Putin to violate the
      terms of a settlement or reinvade.


      In exchanging a Western commitment to Ukraine’s permanent neutrality for a Russian
      commitment to support Ukraine’s E.U. membership, the West could use the accession
      process to bring Ukraine’s treatment of ethnic and linguistic minorities into
      conformity with E.U. standards, thereby addressing some stated Russian war aims.

      Success in negotiating a compromise settlement of the war in Ukraine will pivot
      on two factors: finding sufficient overlap among the core interests of the United
      States, Russia, Ukraine, and Europe; and employing America’s leverage over these
      players in ways that incentivize a compromise and penalize obstinance. The Biden
      administration misunderstood the leverage it had in forging a settlement, mistakenly
      believing that the key to success was a combination of maximizing Ukraine’s battlefield
      success while sanctioning Russia economically and diplomatically.


      In fact, America can maximize its leverage in settlement talks by refocusing on
      the broader geopolitical context for the war: Russia’s objection to a NATO–centric
      European security order in which Russia has no place and its neighbors sooner
      or later become military partners of the United States.


      To most effectively use American leverage and secure Ukraine, it is important
      to understand Russia’s broader geopolitical aims. While Russia is clearly willing
      to use aggression and violate international norms and laws to reach these aims,
      we argue that the aims themselves are based on Russian security on its periphery
      and not aggressive expansion and conquest for its own sake. Once the context is
      expanded from the battlefield within Ukraine to the overall question of Russia’s
      relation to the European security order, the U.S. has powerful cards to play —
      both in the areas of threats and incentives. These leverage points can be activated
      to pursue key U.S. aims ranging from a secure and European–aligned Ukrainian state
      to disrupting the increasing alignment between Russia and China.1


      The search for a stable and lasting peace settlement to end the Ukraine War must
      also be founded on a recognition of certain inescapable realities. Neither Ukraine
      nor Russia will withdraw from territory that they currently hold; Ukraine will
      not abandon its desire to be part of the West socially, culturally, and economically;
      and Russia will not accept any settlement that allows Ukraine to become part of
      the West militarily.


      Harmonizing these imperatives will not be easy. But both Washington and Moscow
      have a strong interest in reaching a deal that addresses Russia’s legitimate security
      concerns and, in return, leads to a halt in Russia’s military offensive and a
      comprehensive peace settlement minimizing the risk of future war.2Without such
      a deal, the U.S. and Europe would be forced to continue to provide massive military
      and financial aid to Ukraine indefinitely, while still facing the risk of Ukrainian
      collapse.3For its part, Russia would continue to suffer casualties, would experience
      more pressure on its economy, and would have no guarantee of victory absent more
      intensive mobilization, which would carry domestic political risks.4


      It is the thesis of this brief that a stable and lasting settlement that supports
      a secure Ukraine is attainable if the U.S. makes full use of its leverage in the
      broader European security sphere.


      Process and Timing for Negotiating a Ceasefire The Russian government has already
      made it clear that it will not agree to a ceasefire in advance of a general settlement
      (naturally, since Russian advances on the battlefield and the threat of a Ukrainian
      military collapse are Moscow’s principal source of leverage in negotiations).
      There would therefore be little point in a U.S. delegation placing a proposal
      for an immediate ceasefire at the top of their negotiating position. The details
      of a ceasefire or armistice — including the composition and role of an international
      force to guarantee it — will be highly complicated to negotiate. This is an additional
      argument for a multitrack negotiating process, in which certain issues will be
      negotiated between the U.S. and Russia, and others — including the terms of a
      ceasefire — will obviously have to involve Ukraine. The U.S.–Russia track should,
      however, come first. This is because accommodations with Russia on broader security
      issues (which can be negotiated only by the U.S.) provide the best chance that
      Russia will agree to end its gradually advancing offensive and establish a ceasefire,
      and will agree to modify its demands to Ukraine in the areas of arms limitations
      and internal policies.


      Sources of U.S. leverage


      In a broader negotiation over the European security order and the roles of Russia
      and Ukraine within it, the Trump administration has many cards to play. They fall
      broadly into the following categories:


      Military leverage


      The U.S. has significant leverage based not primarily on its support for the Ukrainian
      military, but on the dominant U.S. and NATO military position in Europe.


      Under existing conditions, the United States and NATO should not end military
      support for Ukraine, which would almost certainly hasten Ukraine’s collapse and
      put Russia in a position to dictate, rather than negotiate, the terms of a settlement.5Continuing
      this aid is critical to slow Russia’s advances and allow time for negotiations.
      Nonetheless, new tranches of aid beyond what has already been pledged should be
      short-term commitments and should be focused on defensive weaponry — sending a
      not-so-subtle message from Washington to Kyiv that it must engage in good-faith
      diplomacy to settle the war or risk losing U.S. support altogether.


      Although such aid is necessary for now, America’s military leverage over Russia
      does not flow from its ability to tilt battlefield conditions in Ukraine’s favor.
      Since the first year of the war, Russia has adapted tactics and developed technical
      countermeasures to compensate for America’s superior real-time intelligence and
      precision weaponry, turning the conflict into a war of attrition that plays to
      Moscow’s advantage.6The United States and Europe combined lack the industrial
      capacity to match Russia’s artillery production — a key factor in the war — and
      it would take years to produce air defense systems on the scale Ukraine requires
      to defend its cities and critical infrastructure against Russian air, missile,
      and drone attacks.7The only way that the United States and NATO could overcome
      Russia’s vast manpower advantages over Ukraine would be through direct military
      intervention — a step that could easily lead to nuclear war.


      Rather, our military leverage to end the conflict lies beyond Ukraine — in Russia’s
      broader concerns about threats posed by the NATO alliance, which has doubled in
      size since the end of the Cold War and grown still larger since Russia’s invasion
      of Ukraine. NATO now shares a border with Russia that, at 1,700 miles, is almost
      as long as that between Mexico and the United States. NATO also has a very substantial
      conventional arms advantage over Russia, and this will only increase as Europe
      rearms.8


      Russia’s December 2021 demand prior to the full-scale Ukraine invasion that NATO
      withdraw forces from its postexpansion borders reflects security concerns that
      have likely become even more urgent in light of additional NATO expansion after
      2022.9While Russia’s 2021 demand was far too sweeping for NATO to meet, the initial
      Russian focus on NATO deployments shows how many cards the U.S. has to play in
      this area.


      The question of limits on Ukraine’s own military holdings was a central issue
      in Turkish–mediated settlement talks between Russian and Ukrainian negotiators
      early after Russia’s invasion. Russia insisted on stringent quantitative and qualitative
      caps; Ukraine pressed its need for a capable self-defense force coupled with security
      guarantees from a range of other states.


      When the Istanbul talks broke down in mid–April 2022, the two sides remained far
      apart on force limitations. The Ukrainians called for a peacetime army of 250,000;
      the Russians insisted on a maximum of 85,000 — considerably smaller than the standing
      army Ukraine had before the invasion in 2022.10The Ukrainians wanted 800 tanks,
      while the Russians insisted on less than half that number. The difference between
      limitations on the range of missiles each side advocated was even wider: the Ukrainians
      proposed a limit of 280 kilometers, and the Russians demanded 40 kilometers —
      hardly more than an advanced artillery system.11


      It is possible — even likely — that the gap between the Ukrainians and Russians
      on this matter is even greater today than it was during the Istanbul talks in
      2022. Putin has said that Istanbul should remain the framework for a settlement,
      but nearly three subsequent years of bloodshed will likely have resulted in a
      stiffening of Russian demands.12For its part, Ukraine’s estimate of the force
      it requires for self-defense is likely to be much larger if NATO or its individual
      members remain reluctant to commit to hard security guarantees against future
      Russian invasion.


      By itself, Ukraine has little leverage over Russia on this matter, particularly
      as its battlefield prospects dim.13But the United States and NATO do. As discussed
      above, NATO’s military posture is critical to Russian security concerns.14U.S.
      negotiators can point out that, should Russia balk at reasonable force limitations
      in Ukraine (which should also require reciprocal limits on Russian deployments
      opposite Ukraine), the West would be forced to increase the size of its own forces
      around Ukraine and bordering Russia. Our willingness to constrain the range of
      ground- and air-launched missiles that we provide to Ukraine should also be conditioned
      on Russia’s willingness to agree to reasonable caps on its own forces and Ukrainian
      forces.


      Along these lines, discussion of force limits and weapons holdings within the
      Ukraine negotiations will open the broader question of modifying the Adapted Treaty
      on Conventional Forces in Europe, CFE, which was signed in 1999 and ratified by
      Russia, but never ratified by the United States.15Russia is probably not eager
      to bear the high costs of maintaining a standing army sufficient to counter the
      combined forces of NATO, whose membership has almost doubled in size since the
      adapted CFE treaty was signed. Holding out the prospect of broader talks on conventional
      forces in Europe could serve as an incentive for Moscow to strike a reasonable
      compromise with Ukraine over force limitations.


      Adding to the potential pressure on Russia, in 2026 the United States plans to
      station intermediate-range, nuclear-capable missiles in Germany for the first
      time since the 1980s.16NATO’s 1983–85 deployment of Pershing II missiles in Europe
      to counter the Soviet Union’s SS-20s prompted grave fears in Moscow over hair-trigger
      warning times and the potential for nuclear “decapitation.” Such fears ultimately
      led to the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, which banned intermediate-range
      missiles as a class and helped lead to broader improvements in U.S.–Soviet relations.
      Similarly, signaling a willingness to reconsider or expand the planned deployments
      for 2026 could significantly affect Russia’s openness to compromise over Ukraine.


      Maintaining a Ceasefire It is highly unlikely that the legal status of Ukrainian
      territory will be fully resolved in a near-term negotiation process. But the fact
      that the legal status of territories occupied by Russia will be unresolved is
      not an insuperable obstacle. The Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus has been
      internationally unrecognized since it was established by the Turkish invasion
      of 1974, without a return to war. Poland and the Soviet Union seized Silesia,
      Prussia, and other territories from Germany at the end of World War II, but Germany
      did not recognize their sovereignty until 1990. Long before that, however, a transformed
      Germany and Europe had rejected the idea of Germany going to war to recover these
      territories. What must be avoided in the case of Ukraine and Russia is a situation
      like that in Kashmir, or in the Donbas from 2014 to 2022, in which forces on both
      sides of the armistice line exchange fire repeatedly, with the permanent risk
      that local clashes will escalate into full-scale conflict. If local clashes or
      terror strikes were to continue after an armistice, it would make a resumption
      of war vastly more likely. The imperfect answer, therefore, is a demilitarized
      zone dividing the two sides, patrolled by an international peacekeeping force
      with sufficient teeth to repel small-scale incursions. This zone should be broad
      enough to exclude exchanges of fire by small arms and medium-range artillery.
      Agreement on the nature of a peacekeeping force will be a critical aspect of negotiations.
      No realistically conceivable peacekeeping force will be strong enough to repel
      a full-scale assault by either side. Ideas being put forward for a large European
      force to guarantee Ukraine are seen in Russia as simply Ukrainian NATO membership
      by another name, and will therefore be rejected by Moscow. It also seems extremely
      unlikely that European states would agree to deploy such a force without a U.S.
      promise to come to their aid in the case of war. This is something that the Trump
      administration would not — and should not — agree to. An alternative would be
      a U.N. force composed of troops from the Global South, backed by a U.N. monitoring
      commission. Such a force would drastically raise the diplomatic costs to Russia
      of renewed aggression. The core of Russian political strategy has been the appeal
      to what it calls the “Global Majority” against the West. A war that began with
      Russians killing Indian peacekeepers would, therefore, be a political disaster
      for Russia.


      Diplomatic engagement


      One of the greatest sources of American leverage flows from a commodity that is
      as intangible as it is important: respect.


      Russia considers itself a great power, and it doubts that it could survive for
      long were it not one given its broad geographic expanse, its history of foreign
      invasion, and its multiethnic composition.17 But Russians have long been frustrated
      by the West’s reluctance to accord the respect they feel their status merits and
      their security demands. This frustration has in recent years turned into anger
      as U.S. and European officials have spoken openly about inflicting a “strategic
      defeat” on Russia, at times even expressing hopes for regime change.18


      As doors to Western institutions have closed — largely due to Russia’s own counterproductive
      behavior — Moscow has grown increasingly dependent on its relations with China
      and the Global South.19But most Russians find these circumstances far from ideal.
      They have little desire to play junior partner to a rising China, and they consider
      themselves more European than Asian in their culture and values.


      From Moscow’s perspective, finding a way back into Western forums would accord
      with Russia’s self-image as a great power, provide it with a voice in a region
      it perceives as critical to its security interests, and offer greater room for
      maneuver in its relations with China. But they have for years doubted that the
      West has any interest in such engagement. The first small step toward greater
      Russian inclusion would be a direct summit meeting between the U.S. and Russian
      presidents, but this should be offered only as an incentive for genuine progress
      toward ending the war in Ukraine.


      Arrangements for implementing an Ukraine settlement may also offer a creative
      means for Moscow gradually to acclimate the West to growing Russian involvement
      in European security matters. In the draft Istanbul accord, Ukraine proposed an
      international group of guarantors that would include, among others, the United
      States, Russia, the U.K., France, Germany, Italy, Poland, and Turkey.20Such a
      group could initially oversee implementation of a settlement and resolve the disputes
      that will inevitably arise over its provisions.Over time, Russia’s good-faith
      negotiation and implementation of a settlement in Ukraine could allow that group
      to expand its discussions to include security matters in other parts of Europe
      where conflicts with Russia might emerge. The prospect of membership in such a
      body could be a significant incentive for Russia to make concessions on Ukraine’s
      borders and pursue a broader détente with the West. Rather than trading land for
      peace — a negotiating formula that was once the conceptual basis for settling
      the Israel–Palestine conflict — the Western approach could offer a path toward
      gradual Russian inclusion in European councils in return for good-faith implementation
      of a settlement in Ukraine.21


      Economic leverage


      Sanctions relief is a key leverage point in the overarching incentive structure
      to make a settlement stick. For Moscow to have a stake in peace, it must internalize
      both the benefits of compliance and the costs of violating provisions agreed upon
      with Ukraine and the West.22These positive and negative incentives are best captured
      through the permanent, conditional suspension of specific sanctions, as opposed
      to their unconditional removal. The West would commit to lift and not reimpose
      certain sanctions pending Russia’s commitment to mutually agreed-upon peace provisions,
      such as respecting Ukraine’s territorial integrity or not interfering with the
      legitimate activities of peacekeepers in Ukraine. These agreements would be bolstered
      with verification protocols, which could lead to the reimposition of sanctions.


      For this regime to be effective, it must be established and enforced in a piecemeal
      fashion reflecting the diverse scope of prospective agreements between the U.S.
      and Russia, Ukraine and Russia, and European states or the E.U. and Russia; the
      reimposition of certain sanctions in case of noncompliance in a specific area
      does not imply the reinstatement of all sanctions. Compartmentalizing sanctions
      relief and compliance across multiple subagreements disincentivizes Russian leaders
      from adopting the dangerous zero-sum thinking that there is no difference between
      violating one or all of the peace provisions. A graduated approach would force
      Russia to weigh the costs of partial noncompliance against the benefits of other
      sanctions that have not yet been reimposed, reducing the risk of an isolated violation
      spiraling into a breakdown of the wider peace framework and increasing the chances
      of successfully bringing Russia back into compliance.


      Related to sanctions is the issue of the $300 billion worth of Russian assets
      in the E.U. and U.S. that were frozen as a result of the Ukraine invasion.23While
      the revenue from these assets is already being tapped to finance the Ukrainian
      military, they should not be fully seized outside of the context of a negotiated
      agreement.24Instead, they should be saved as leverage during talks. Securing Russia’s
      explicit agreement for these assets to become part of an international Ukraine
      reconstruction fund would avoid the chilling effect that unilateral seizure would
      produce on international investors.25 The use of such funds, which have probably
      already been written off by Russia, would be preferable to Russia than reparations
      drawn directly from its current economy. Offering the potential that a portion
      of these funds may potentially be allocated to regions under de facto Russian
      control would also give Moscow an additional incentive to comply with a peace
      deal.


      A broader advantage of the use of sanctions relief as negotiating and enforcement
      leverage for an agreement is its relation to economic normalization in Europe.
      Such normalization is significant not just as a bargaining chip vis-à-vis Russia,
      but as a boon to beleaguered E.U. states, serving to incentivize their support
      for a compromise to end the war. Europe cannot be expected to assume greater charge
      of its defense and of Ukraine’s postwar reconstruction while its economies continue
      to suffer from blowback produced by the international sanctions on Russia.


      Europe’s sustained stability and prosperity are best served by developing a format
      for energy normalization that would see renewed Russian energy exports into Europe,
      potentially through a resumption of Russian gas flows through the Nord Stream
      pipelines.26The U.S., Russia, and E.U. partners should explore optimal terms on
      which these gas exports can resume. U.S. acquisition and partial ownership of
      Nord Stream 2 could minimize Western concerns of Moscow leveraging its energy
      exports as a tool of geoeconomic influence, reassure European partners, and serve
      U.S. financial interests. Other formats — including Gazprom ownership subject
      to mutually agreed E.U. oversight and regulations — can also be explored during
      negotiations.27


      Ukraine’s deposits of strategic minerals, which include lithium, uranium, titanium,
      graphite, and rare earth metals, offer an opportunity for creative diplomacy in
      incentivizing both Russia and Ukraine to reach a compromise settlement of the
      war. Many of these mineral deposits lie in Russian–controlled parts of Ukraine,
      but Russia is not well-positioned to process many of these raw minerals, needing
      both capital and technology to get them to end-user markets.28It is far preferable
      for the United States to incentivize Russian sales of these minerals for processing
      and use in the West than in China.


      There are potentially many ways the terms of a settlement could incentivize both
      Ukrainian and Russian exports of these minerals to the West. One possibility would
      be for the United States to offer technology for processing to both Ukraine and
      Russia with the proviso that exports of refined products go to Western end-users.
      Capital for both Ukrainian and Russian mining and processing of these minerals
      might come from seized Russian assets, again on the premise that exports go to
      the West.


      The power of the E.U. accession process


      Discussions of Ukraine’s future have often assumed that Ukraine would have to
      be highly militarized and under permanent threat of conflict with Russia.29However,
      an effective use of U.S. leverage could secure a future for a neutral but European–aligned
      Ukraine.


      Such a future could combine a path to E.U. membership with military neutrality
      along the lines of Finland or Austria during the Cold War.30E.U. membership would
      satisfy the Ukrainian need for a decisive orientation toward the West and social
      and political membership in the broader European community. At the same time,
      military neutrality could address Russian concerns about a hostile foreign military
      on their border. Russia will clearly not welcome E.U. membership for Ukraine.
      However, we believe that a resolute use of U.S. and NATO leverage around military
      and economic issues, as described above, along with addressing the most fundamental
      Russian security concerns around Ukraine’s military orientation, would make such
      membership achievable within the context of a peace agreement.


      E.U. accession would involve Ukraine meeting E.U. membership requirements around
      economic, social, and political institutions and policies. Given Ukraine’s poverty,
      reputation for corruption, and the political and economic fallout of the war,
      meeting E.U. requirements will not be simple and will depend in part on reconstruction
      efforts.31However, the accession process also offers opportunities for addressing
      one of the thorniest issues around negotiations — namely, the Russian demand for
      the “denazification” of Ukraine. This is perhaps the most difficult of all the
      issues involved in the peace process, because — unlike NATO membership or European
      security — it falls entirely within the purview of Ukrainian domestic law, and
      only the Ukrainian government and parliament can ratify any agreement around the
      political and social changes necessary for it.


      However, since the Russian government has never defined in detail what it means
      by its demand that Ukraine “denazify,” there are grounds for optimism that, in
      return for Moscow and Washington reaching a satisfactory agreement on security
      issues, Moscow will reduce its demand for “denazification” to an acceptable level.32


      Russian demands cover two areas: an end to Ukrainian extreme nationalism, and
      constitutional guarantees for Russian language and cultural rights within Ukraine.
      Two potentially fruitful approaches for U.S. negotiators are to render commitments
      in this area acceptable to Ukraine by making them reciprocal (i.e., applicable
      to both Russia and Ukraine), and to make Ukrainian moves in these directions part
      of its process of accession to the European Union rather than as concessions to
      Russia.


      Russian hardliners have defined “denazification” as regime change, which is both
      totally unacceptable for the U.S. and unachievable by Russia. However, the Austrian
      State Treaty of 1955, which established Austrian neutrality, contains a clause
      banning Nazi parties and symbols, as does the German constitution.33The introduction
      of such a clause into the Ukrainian constitution may be an acceptable compromise.


      The E.U. accession process would put leverage on Ukraine to reach an acceptable
      compromise on minority rights. Minority rights are enshrined in the European Union’s
      acquis communautaire and in the Council of Europe’s Framework Convention for the
      Protection of National Minorities that aspirants to join the E.U. are required
      to sign and adhere to (though they have been flagrantly violated by Latvia and
      Estonia).34Adherence is monitored by several supervisory bodies of the Council
      of Europe.35


      Moreover, under pressure from Hungary and the E.U., Ukraine has in fact guaranteed
      such rights to a range of small national minorities in line with recommendations
      of the European Council’s Venice Commission, but excluded the huge Russian minority
      (illegitimately, though for obvious political reasons).36As part of a peace settlement
      and its E.U. application, Ukraine should be required to observe consistency in
      this area, and to end its campaign against Russian cultural and historical monuments
      in Ukraine.


      Advancing other strategic goals


      Just as American leverage in negotiations to end the war flows from issues beyond
      the narrow Russian–Ukrainian relationship, Washington can use the settlement process
      as leverage to pursue strategic objectives that extend beyond the Ukraine conflict
      itself. In an increasingly multipolar world where the rise of Chinese power has
      become America’s foremost foreign policy challenge, Washington needs Europe to
      play a more significant role as a capable counterweight to Russia. The United
      States also needs to exploit divergent interests between Moscow and Beijing rather
      than continuing to incentivize a Chinese–Russian partnership that is hostile to
      American interests. Both these objectives can be advanced through the Ukraine
      settlement process.


      Playing the China card


      Ukraine is a small but meaningful point of friction between Russia and China.
      Beijing undoubtedly sympathizes with Putin’s concerns about NATO expansion, which
      Chinese officials and leading Chinese experts cite as the primary cause of the
      war.37They certainly do not want Russia to lose, which from their perspective
      would enable an invigorated West to refocus its resources and attention on China,
      while crippling Russia’s ability to help Beijing deal with Western pressure.38But,
      at the same time, Beijing is clearly not happy about Russia’s territorial grab
      in Ukraine, which plays on China’s memories of Western invasion and occupation.
      Chinese officials have also been outspoken in warning Russia against the dangers
      of nuclear saber-rattling in the war.39


      China’s appointment of a special Ukraine peace envoy probably flows not only from
      this mix of concerns, but also from its hope that facilitating a compromise settlement
      could pay dividends for China’s image in Europe — a market that is growing in
      importance to Beijing as trade with the United States comes increasingly under
      threat.40China also wants to blunt momentum toward growing NATO involvement in
      Asia, and it likely sees support for peace in Ukraine as a means of combating
      anti–Chinese sentiment in Europe. Washington can exploit this Chinese ambivalence
      — not to seek Chinese help in mediation but to spur Russia toward good-faith negotiations
      and to ensure that it complies with the terms of a settlement.


      Inviting China’s special envoy on Ukraine to visit the United States and discuss
      a settlement — something Beijing sought but Biden refused to offer — would put
      pressure on Putin, as he would be hard-pressed to refrain from engagement in a
      process that his primary partner supports. Moreover, a significant Chinese role
      in the postaccord reconstruction of Ukraine would give China a stake in preserving
      peace in Ukraine and serve as a powerful disincentive for Putin to violate the
      terms of a settlement or reinvade. In narrowing Putin’s room to maneuver on Ukraine
      through American engagement with China, Washington will not drive a wedge between
      Moscow and Beijing, but it will highlight their divergent interests in Europe
      and reduce their incentives for making common cause against the United States.


      Strengthening Europe


      With regard to Europe itself, the war in Ukraine has exposed some uncomfortable
      realities. A Europe whose industries are unable to produce the large volumes of
      weaponry and ammunition necessary for sustained warfare, and which lacks significant
      logistical capabilities and unified military leadership, cannot serve as a strategic
      asset for the United States in counterbalancing and deterring Russia through its
      own resources.41Overreliance on American patronage has also allowed European diplomacy
      to become insolvent, seeking end goals — including Russia’s capitulation and internal
      transformation — that are far beyond its means and arguably at odds with its actual
      strategic interests.


      In seeking a settlement in Ukraine, the United States should incorporate incentives
      for Europe to address these deficiencies. In part, this can be done by making
      clear that Europe will bear the primary military responsibility for deterring
      and, if necessary, responding to a new Russian invasion of Ukraine.42This prospect
      should focus Europe’s attention on the yawning gap between its current capabilities
      and those necessary for success in this task, incentivizing much greater military
      production and rationalizing its weapons programs.


      This responsibility should also encourage a more realistic European approach to
      diplomacy with Russia.43European stability is a precondition for an expanded European
      geopolitical role. Although the United States should play the leading role in
      parlaying negotiations with Russia over Ukraine into broader discussions about
      European security, our allies will need to engage in talks over codes of conduct
      and confidence and security-building measures aimed at preventing or defusing
      conflicts in such hot spots as Belarus, Kaliningrad, Moldova, the Balkans, and
      beyond. A Europe riven by crises and divided by a modern variation of the Iron
      Curtain will be a weak and preoccupied Europe, unable to play a constructive and
      stabilizing role in the evolving multipolar order.'

    paragraph_summary: The article argues that the United States' success in negotiating
      an end to the war in Ukraine hinges on broadening the scope of negotiations beyond
      a bilateral focus on Russia and Ukraine. It suggests that a narrow approach favors
      Russia, which has leveraged its military and population advantages in a war of
      attrition against Ukraine. Instead, the U.S. should recognize Russia's broader
      security concerns related to NATO and the European security order, using this
      understanding to create leverage in negotiations. Key strategies include offering
      conditional sanctions relief to incentivize compliance, engaging China in discussions
      to pressure Russia, and proposing a framework for Ukraine's neutrality in exchange
      for support of its EU membership. The article emphasizes the importance of addressing
      Russia's legitimate security interests while ensuring Ukraine's sovereignty and
      stability, advocating for a multi-track negotiation process that includes military,
      diplomatic, and economic leverage to achieve a lasting peace settlement.

    text: 'Overview


      Introduction


      During his presidential campaign, President–elect Trump repeatedly warned that
      the world was on the brink of World War III. This rhetoric represented a clear
      recognition that we have seen an alarming slide toward increased global conflict
      in recent years. Dramatically increased tensions have emerged, or outright hot
      wars have erupted, around the planet from Ukraine to Taiwan, Korea, and the Middle
      East.


      To truly put U.S. interests first, we must not accept the concept of a new global
      war while urging American participation in it, as some would have us do. Even
      apart from the risk of nuclear catastrophe, a true slide into World War III would
      carry immense costs for U.S. domestic revitalization, our security at home, and
      our global position abroad. Instead, we must pursue a vision of U.S. foreign policy
      leadership that emphasizes using our national strength to avert global conflict
      and supports a more stable, peaceful international order that will benefit the
      United States. This report contains a set of recommendations for the incoming
      Trump administration designed to support that vision.


      The War in Ukraine


      George Beebe, Anatol Lieven


      Strategic Outlook


      Neither side in the Russia–Ukraine War can win unconditionally. Ukraine is too
      vast and its resistance too determined for Russia to conquer, occupy, and govern
      the majority of the country. At the same time, Ukraine has shown that it cannot
      drive Russian forces off the territory it occupies. On the contrary, if the war
      continues, Ukraine may lose much more territory. Absent a compromise settlement,
      the war can only lead to direct U.S.–Russian conflict or to Ukraine’s becoming
      a failed state, with severe implications for European and global stability. A
      continuation of the war also involves the permanent risk of a broader clash between
      Russia and NATO.


      Similarly, the two warring parties are not capable of reaching a compromise settlement
      without U.S. leadership. Biden’s policy of refusing to engage Russian President
      Putin and insisting that Ukraine should decide if and when to seek peace has sacrificed
      U.S. leverage, saddled Ukrainian President Zelenskyy with the political dangers
      of initiating negotiations, and needlessly prolonged the war.


      Recommendations


      Put U.S. interests first.


      U.S. interests should be our north star in negotiations with Russia and Ukraine
      to end the war. Foremost among these is the establishment of a stable balance
      of power in Europe underpinned by Europeans themselves that deters, rather than
      provokes, further Russian aggression.


      Broaden the problem.


      Biden has erroneously viewed the war as a conflict over territory, believing Ukraine’s
      leverage depends on pushing Russian lines back. But for Russia, this war is primarily
      about defusing the threat posed by the United States and NATO. Putin cannot secure
      Russia against the 32-member NATO alliance or new U.S. missile technology by winning
      the war in Ukraine. Broadening discussions to include regional security matters
      is key to maximizing U.S. leverage. Engaging Russia on NATO expansion and the
      stationing of offensive missiles in Europe could create Russian openness to E.U.
      membership for Ukraine and strong, verifiable guarantees against a renewal of
      Russian aggression against remaining Ukrainian territory.


      Play the China card.


      China does not want Russia to lose the war but, at the same time, it wants the
      war to end because it is undermining its trade with Europe. China is particularly
      unhappy about North Korea’s growing military involvement in the war, in part because
      it will encourage greater NATO involvement in Asia. We can exploit this ambivalence
      by engaging China bilaterally in the search for a peace settlement, which would
      increase pressure on Putin to compromise. A significant Chinese role in reconstructing
      Ukraine could also help ensure that Russia will not violate the terms of a settlement
      and reinvade Ukraine, as Russia has become enormously dependent on its relations
      with Beijing. The United States should also reach out to major neutral countries
      like India and Brazil to support a settlement.


      NATO and Europe


      Anatol Lieven, George Beebe


      Strategic Outlook


      The United States should return to its European strategy during the Cold War and
      refocus on securing NATO within its existing borders. For more than 100 years,
      it has been the great states and economies of Western and Central Europe — not
      the countries on Europe’s periphery — that have been key to U.S. interests on
      the European continent. Today, however, these states are showing disturbing signs
      of political instability and economic weakness, in part because of the costs and
      economic damage resulting from the Russia–Ukraine War.


      The new administration should recognize that further expansion of NATO would not
      strengthen the alliance but would weaken it. The United States would be drawn
      into commitments that would involve enormous dangers and no gains in terms of
      enhanced U.S. security. The American public and political system would be unwilling
      to support the direct involvement of U.S. troops in wars on the Eurasian periphery,
      as we have seen in practice in the Russia–Ukraine War.


      Recommendations


      Lay the groundwork for European strategic autonomy.


      In its policy toward existing U.S. allies in Europe, the Trump administration
      should aim to move chief responsibility for European security onto European countries
      themselves. U.S. military planning and national security strategies should make
      clear the intent to restrict the role of the U.S. military to acting as the ultimate
      backstop for the defense of NATO member states against outside attack.


      The issue of further E.U. enlargement is one for E.U. member states and not the
      United States. However, E.U. member states should be warned that if they embroil
      themselves in local conflicts at the European fringe, the United States will not
      step in to bail them out.


      Refrain from actions that further damage Europe economically, which could undermine
      the capacity for strategic autonomy and burden sharing.


      European economies have been seriously damaged, and political stability has been
      undermined, by the end of Russian energy supplies as a result of the Russian invasion
      of Ukraine. A trade war between the United States and the E.U. could create significant
      further harm to European economies and U.S. relations with key allies, as would
      an attempt to compel Europe to eliminate economic ties with China. A Europe that
      is diminished economically and wrestling with political instability created by
      an economic recession would likely be unable to address the challenges and find
      the political will necessary to pursue strategic autonomy. The Trump administration
      should move with great caution when it comes to the imposition of exclusionary
      trade policies and efforts to press Europe to cut off economic ties with China.


      China


      Jake Werner


      Strategic Outlook


      Over the last four years, the United States has redirected its alliances against
      China, placed damaging restrictions on Chinese access to technology, and sought
      to counter China’s goals around the world. Rather than conceding to U.S. demands,
      China has hardened its defenses and redoubled its capacity to retaliate.


      A renewed emphasis on diplomatic exchange has temporarily calmed dangerous rhetoric,
      yet pressures for conflict are building in both countries and are accompanied
      by a general complacency about the risks. If U.S. leaders continue to treat China’s
      existence as a rising power as intrinsically incompatible with U.S. interests,
      escalating conflict seems inevitable. The potential costs of outright war for
      the United States and our allies would be enormous. However, tough bargaining
      over a new mutual understanding could transform the relationship to one of mutual
      benefit and win direct gains for American security and prosperity.


      Recommendations


      Reduce military tensions in the Taiwan Strait.


      Taiwan is the most likely source of conflict between the United States and China.
      The deterioration of the U.S.–China relationship has badly undermined the trust
      on both sides that is required to sustain peace and prosperity for Taiwan. U.S.
      policy should aim for a balance between deterrence and reassurance.


      Diplomatically, the United States should revitalize its commitment to its longstanding
      One China Policy. This involves reiterating U.S. openness to any peaceful, uncoerced
      resolution of the issue while, at the same time, pressing Beijing to explicitly
      reject any timeline for unification. In coordination with Taipei, Washington should
      lay the groundwork for negotiations with Beijing on reduced militarization of
      the Taiwan Strait and refrain from provocative actions that destabilize the status
      quo in the area, such as high-profile visits to Taiwan. At the same time, the
      United States should strengthen military deterrence by continuing to support Taiwan
      in developing a “porcupine strategy” for deterring Chinese aggression through
      investments in coastal defense and enhanced resilience.


      Negotiate maritime agreements in the South China Sea.


      In the maritime realm, the United States should pursue an agreement with China
      on safety in bilateral encounters at sea involving coast guard vessels, which
      would join standing bilateral agreements regarding naval and air force encounters.
      Washington should also pursue negotiations to lower military tensions in the South
      China Sea. The United States would reduce its close-in surveillance near Chinese
      naval bases, as well as its operations near disputed islands and reefs, in exchange
      for China’s affirmation of freedom of navigation and the legal rights of military
      vessels at sea. The U.S. should also press China and other claimants to publicly
      reaffirm that they will not use force to dislodge rivals from any disputed land
      features.


      Develop more effective crisis prevention and crisis management mechanisms with
      China.


      Deepening U.S.–China antagonism is increasing the possibility of a future crisis.
      Current crisis management mechanisms are inadequate and require improvement. A
      presidentially endorsed, two-tier crisis prevention and crisis management dialogue
      is needed, with one side largely civilian-led and focused on policy-related sources
      of crises, and the other civilian- and military-led and focused on management
      issues. Such negotiations should aim to create informal communication channels
      to clarify the intentions and actions under crisis conditions, a set of crisis
      prevention and crisis management guidelines, and a professional Crisis Working
      Group inside key decision-making bodies. Department of Defense funding for such
      dialogues should be considered during the fiscal year 2026 budgeting process.


      Forge a new economic relationship with China based on reciprocal exchange rather
      than exclusion.


      U.S.–China economic tensions have become one of the most destabilizing problems
      in the relationship, convincing broad constituencies on both sides that the two
      countries’ core interests are incompatible while fueling efforts to cut off access
      to markets and technology. U.S. complaints about Chinese economic statecraft are
      well-founded, but they do not always recognize the need on the Chinese side to
      sustain economic growth and development.


      An exclusionary response to these problems is unacceptable to Beijing and is likely
      to damage the competitiveness of U.S. companies as Chinese firms gain an edge
      in certain sectors. Instead, the United States should take a page out of the Chinese
      playbook. As President–elect Trump has suggested, we should condition Chinese
      access to the U.S. market on direct investment to employ U.S. workers and, where
      applicable, technology transfer to help U.S. businesses. This approach would help
      U.S. businesses while increasing market competition and reducing geoeconomic conflict.


      Avoid across-the-board “decoupling;” assess U.S.–China links based on their full
      costs and benefits.


      Pressures for a total decoupling and end to contact between the United States
      and China risk severing connections that are beneficial to U.S. prosperity and
      technological advancement. They could also harm America’s standing as a free and
      open society. U.S.–China contacts should be assessed individually based on their
      actual national security risks and the benefits they could bring.


      Korean Peninsula


      James Park


      Strategic Outlook


      The security competition between North and South Korea has dramatically deteriorated
      in recent years in ways that call into question the sustainability of the status
      quo. Both Koreas have intensified saber-rattling and increasingly oriented their
      military postures around offensive, rather than defensive, capabilities and strategies.


      South Korea has moved toward an overt preemptive posture, threatening to destroy
      North Korean nuclear facilities and decapitate the North Korean leadership in
      the event of conflict. North Korea has threatened preventive nuclear first use
      in the event of conflict and developed low-yield tactical nuclear weapons to make
      that policy more credible. These military developments, along with the prolonged
      suspension of military-diplomatic dialogue between the two Koreas, have increased
      the risk of nuclear escalation. At the same time, growing tensions between the
      United States, Russia, and China have eroded the capacity for multilateral regional
      diplomacy.


      Recommendations


      Reorient allied deterrence of North Korea toward defensive military capabilities.


      The current approach to deterrence by the U.S.–South Korea alliance emphasizes
      aggressive, offensive threats such as preemptive strikes, overwhelming retaliatory
      operations, and leadership decapitation. This position comes with serious risks
      of North Korean overreactions and miscalculations that make nuclear use more likely.
      Despite North Korea’s gains in nuclear capability, the U.S.–South Korea alliance
      holds comprehensive military superiority, meaning that any full-scale war would
      likely be regime-ending for North Korea. When such an overwhelming military mismatch
      is already clear, piling up further threats of punishment offers little benefit
      and risks exacerbating threat perceptions and escalatory dynamics.


      To enhance stability and lower the risk of conflict on the Korean Peninsula, the
      United States should work with South Korea to minimize its reliance on offensive
      military threats toward North Korea and reorient allied deterrence to focus on
      defensive capabilities and warnings.


      Pursue arms control negotiations with North Korea.


      The existing U.S. policy of employing military and economic pressure to fully
      denuclearize North Korea has been unsuccessful for three decades. The steady increase
      of military pressure, far from convincing North Korea to commit to denuclearization,
      has had the opposite effect, motivating it to develop a stronger nuclear deterrent.
      Due to North Korea’s nuclear advancements, using military threats to compel the
      regime’s disarmament is becoming riskier and more infeasible. Meanwhile, applying
      sanctions to pressure North Korea into nuclear talks is increasingly impractical
      as key players such as Russia and China are reluctant to coordinate with the United
      States.


      Acknowledging the futility of completely eliminating North Korean threats through
      total disarmament, the incoming Trump administration should work with South Korea
      to explore a more realistic security negotiation framework. Such a framework would
      deemphasize the complete denuclearization of North Korea as a goal and instead
      seek arms control and confidence-building measures to reduce nuclear threats and
      escalation risks.


      East Asian Alliances


      Jake Werner


      Strategic outlook


      In the past four years, the United States has doubled down on bilateral and minilateral
      security cooperation with regional allies, creating a latticework security structure
      aimed at containing China and regaining a superior military position in the Western
      Pacific. This approach allowed the United States to enhance joint military interoperability,
      deploy more strategic assets, and strengthen the overall U.S. forward presence.


      Even so, the post–Cold War U.S. approach, aimed at dominating opponents from the
      outset of hostilities, is increasingly difficult in the face of a deteriorating
      U.S. fiscal position, the reluctance of regional states to choose between China
      and the United States, and the fundamental difficulty of projecting U.S. military
      power across the extensive Pacific Ocean.


      A U.S. approach to regional alliances aimed solely at a military organization
      of allies against China, North Korea, and Russia, without offering positive prospects
      to rivals through diplomacy, is unlikely to optimize U.S. interests. It will lead
      the targets of U.S. hostility to increasingly align against U.S. interests, force
      unpleasant or impractical choices on allies, and undermine prospects for multilateral
      cooperation in Asia.


      Recommendations


      Restructure U.S. regional alliances around a defensive strategy that is strong
      but smart.


      U.S. efforts to reassert complete military dominance in the Western Pacific are
      unlikely to succeed and will endanger U.S. interests and regional peace and stability.
      At the strategic level, such efforts contribute to the intensity of the security
      dilemma unfolding in the region between China and the United States and its allies
      and partners. At the operational level, a U.S. strategy of control and the massing
      of potent but vulnerable assets in forward locations, juxtaposed against China’s
      forward-leaning military strategy, undermine crisis stability by creating incentives
      for each side to strike first and rapidly escalate in a conflict.


      Instead, the United States should empower countries in the region to do more for
      their defense while restructuring the U.S. force posture to a more defensive,
      denial-oriented approach. Rather than seeking to exercise dominance or control
      in the Western Pacific, the United States should seek to deter offensive actions
      and deny efforts to control the air and seas by China or other nations. This could
      be done at a lower cost than the current policy by reducing emphasis on forward-deployed
      ground troops, tactical aircraft, and large surface platforms while increasing
      reliance on submarines, smaller surface ships, and long-range, conventional weapons
      delivery systems. The U.S. military should also prioritize attaining more strategic
      depth with an increased dispersal of its forces in the region.


      Abandon the framework of zero-sum rivalry and pursue an inclusive regional order.


      China’s growing military power and economic influence need careful management
      to deter Chinese coercion and ensure the security of U.S. allies. The United States
      should continue working closely with allies to strengthen alliance capacities.
      However, orienting alliances toward a zero-sum, exclusionary structure of rivalry
      between the United States and China over core security and economic interests
      is likely to backfire.


      The United States needs a diplomatic approach in East Asia that reflects the complexities
      of a region that desires stable relations with Beijing and Washington, is invested
      in higher levels of economic integration, and cannot be dominated by either power.
      The greatest likelihood of inducing nations in the region to invest in their defense
      — instead of placing the burden on U.S. taxpayers — can be attained if we take
      an approach that aligns with each nation’s self-perceived interests and does not
      attempt to force a radical choice between opposing U.S. and Chinese camps.


      The Broader Middle East


      Trita Parsi


      Strategic outlook


      In autumn 2023, shortly before the October 7 attack by Hamas, National Security
      Advisor Jake Sullivan described the Middle East as “quieter than ever.” More than
      one year later, the region remains at war. Gaza lies in ruins, a functional two-state
      solution to the Israel–Palestine conflict appears less likely than ever, and the
      Israel Defense Forces are actively deployed in southern Lebanon and Syria, as
      well as Gaza. The Houthis have continued to shut down the Red Sea to trade. While
      marking the fall of a dictator, the overthrow of President Assad in Syria raises
      possibilities that include an intensification of the civil war in Syria, the establishment
      of an Islamic–fundamentalist caliphate in the heart of the Middle East, or a transition
      to a unified and more inclusive Syrian government.


      A high possibility remains of a broader war that draws in the United States, especially
      if Israel and Iran resume their cycle of escalation. However, the United States
      has significant cards to play to prevent this outcome.


      Recommendations


      Take clear steps to withdraw U.S. troops from Iraq and Syria.


      Reengage Iran diplomatically.


      Prevent additional escalation between Israel and its neighbors.


      Iraq and Syria


      Adam Weinstein


      Strategic Outlook


      The fall of Assad represents a seismic shift in the region. However, it also puts
      U.S. troops at even greater risk and increases the possibility of the U.S. being
      drawn into a larger conflict. The administration should act on Trump’s recent
      statement that this is not our war. The Biden administration has already announced
      plans to withdraw U.S. troops from Iraq, a decision made within the framework
      of negotiations with the Iraqi government. The new administration should also
      plan for the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Syria through diplomatic engagement
      with Syrian factions and Turkey to ensure the protection of the Kurds, to the
      extent possible. However, the withdrawal of U.S. troops, while potentially a source
      of leverage for encouraging negotiation between Turkey and Kurdish factions, should
      move ahead regardless of the outcomes of those negotiations.


      Recommendations


      Begin a gradual withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq.


      We should end the use of U.S. troops in direct combat operations in Iraq, including
      their role as forward-deployed advisors. The United States can maintain intelligence,
      surveillance, reconnaissance, and targeting capabilities after most U.S. troops
      leave by keeping a limited number of advisors under the Office of Security Cooperation
      and using temporary duty personnel to support the readiness of Iraqi forces through
      training exercises, military delegations, and combined planning efforts, as is
      the U.S. practice in other countries to which it provides military assistance.


      Initiate negotiations in anticipation of withdrawing U.S. troops from Syria.


      With the ascendancy of Hayat Tahrir Al-Sham (HTS) in Syria, the question of Iranian
      influence in the country is no longer a serious issue. As a sectarian movement,
      HTS is likely to displace any remaining support for ISIS, the stated rationale
      for U.S. troops in the country. Previous justifications to keep U.S. troops in
      Syria — valid or not — have withered away. More than ever before, keeping forces
      in the country exposes U.S. troops to direct attack, which creates a political
      risk of U.S. escalation and entanglement in a conflict that is not ours.


      Israel


      Trita Parsi


      Strategic outlook


      A ceasefire has yet to be achieved in Gaza and the ceasefire in Lebanon remains
      fragile, with dozens if not hundreds of violations occurring shortly after the
      latter’s implementation. Israel currently maintains a military advantage, having
      decimated Hezbollah’s senior leadership and demonstrated its ability to carry
      out precision strikes on individuals. In contrast, Iran’s retaliatory actions
      have been largely an ineffective show of force. However, the sustainability of
      this military dominance is uncertain. Iran has now set the precedent of striking
      inside Israeli territory, and it remains unclear if groups such as Hezbollah will
      regenerate their strength.


      To prevent further conflict, the United States and its regional partners must
      genuinely pursue the establishment of a Palestinian state alongside Israel, which
      is key to achieving a stable Middle East that reduces the risk of U.S. entanglement
      in its conflicts and helps facilitate the withdrawal of U.S. forces. The United
      States must leverage its influence with Israel to achieve this goal.


      Washington must also push for a ceasefire in Gaza and ensure that the ceasefire
      in Lebanon is sustainable and genuine.


      Recommendations


      Limit weapons transfers to Israel, particularly 2,000-pound bombs, in accordance
      with existing U.S. laws.


      There is overwhelming evidence that U.S. weapons transferred to Israel have been
      used in violations of domestic human rights-related laws and international humanitarian
      law. Given this, such weapons transfers are illegal under U.S. and international
      law and should cease until the legal use of those weapons can be ensured.


      Oppose Israeli annexation of the West Bank and Gaza and implement targeted sanctions
      against individuals involved in illegal settlement expansion.


      Israeli annexation of the West Bank without citizenship for its Palestinian inhabitants
      could result in the legal or de facto expulsion of millions of Palestinian inhabitants
      to neighboring countries, significantly increasing regional instability. It would
      also eliminate the territorial basis for any possible solution centered on the
      establishment of a Palestinian state.


      Use U.S. leverage to discourage Israel from pursuing counterproductive, maximalist
      goals.


      As Israel’s closest ally, major arms supplier, and key political supporter on
      the international stage, the United States has enormous leverage over Israeli
      actions. Such leverage could prevent Israel from escalating conflicts with its
      neighbors that could draw the United States into war. This is especially important
      in cases in which escalation cannot be pursued without direct U.S. assistance,
      such as an all-out war between Israel and Iran. This leverage will be ineffective
      unless the United States demonstrates the willingness to actually use it.


      Reiterate support for a two-state solution and warn Israel that normalization
      of relations with the Arab world depends on its commitment to this principle.


      The lasting normalization of relations with the Arab world depends on the establishment
      of a Palestinian state. It would also be a historic achievement never attained
      by previous U.S. administrations.


      Iran and the Red Sea


      Trita Parsi


      Strategic outlook


      The Trump administration has a unique opportunity to negotiate with Iran and potentially
      move toward more normalized relations. Trump would enter those discussions with
      leverage because he has shown a willingness to use force against Iran and because
      he is willing to make a deal with the country. However, the withdrawal from the
      Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action did not effectively slow Iran’s nuclear program.
      If Iran is backed into a corner, there is a risk that its leaders will attempt
      to deploy a nuclear deterrent as a last resort. Iran’s current weakness gives
      the United States a diplomatic opening but, if the opening for diplomacy is not
      taken, events could spiral out of control.


      Negotiations with Iran will also give the United States greater opportunities
      to peacefully resolve the issue of Houthi strikes in the Red Sea. Moreover, reduced
      tensions with Tehran will significantly advance Trump’s goal of bringing U.S.
      servicemen and women home from the Middle East.


      Recommendations


      Reengage diplomatically with Iran.


      In a “Nixon goes to China” moment, the Trump administration should formulate and
      present options to the Iranian government for the peaceful integration of Iran
      into a stable Middle East security architecture and its assistance in resolving,
      as opposed to fueling, regional conflicts. The administration should seek an interim
      deal with Iran over its nuclear program before the snapback of sanctions in October
      of 2025, avoiding Iran’s withdrawal from the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of
      Nuclear Weapons.


      Establish a diplomatic contact group to resolve the Red Sea conflict.


      Why is the United States expending billions of dollars to keep the Red Sea shipping
      lanes open? The United States should abandon its costly and largely ineffective
      naval strategy in the Red Sea. Instead, it would be more productive to establish
      a contact group in partnership with the United Nations, including representatives
      from the Houthis, Saudi Arabia, Iran, the United Arab Emirates, China, Russia,
      the European Union, and other members of Operation Prosperity Guardian, with the
      goal of permanently ending Houthi attacks on shipping. The attainment of a ceasefire
      in Gaza would assist this goal.


      Afghanistan


      Adam Weinstein


      Strategic Outlook


      More than three-and-a-half years after foreign troops withdrew from Afghanistan,
      U.S. policy toward the country remains stagnant. In October 2024, Tom West stepped
      down as the U.S. special representative for Afghanistan, and no successor has
      been appointed.


      Completely disengaging from Afghanistan would be a serious mistake. Similar U.S.
      neglect in the 1990s after the Soviet withdrawal ultimately contributed to the
      events of September 11, 2001. Instead, the United States must establish a sustainable
      diplomatic approach that reflects Afghanistan’s reduced importance but does not
      abandon it altogether. Outreach to the Taliban could focus on areas of common
      interest, such as the fight against ISIS-linked terrorists in the Islamic State
      of Khorasan, which is at war with the Taliban. Apparent U.S. willingness to reach
      out to the new regime in Syria, despite its extremist antecedents and links, should
      be a model for the U.S. approach to the Taliban.


      Recommendations


      Empower the Afghanistan Affairs Unit in Doha or appoint a new special representative
      for Afghanistan to engage in direct diplomacy with the Taliban.


      Eliminating the special representative position has both pros and cons. On the
      one hand, it signals a further decrease in the prioritization of Afghanistan and
      could complicate interagency coordination. On the other hand, the high-profile
      nature of the role often involved managing various conflicting stakeholders. The
      lower-profile Afghanistan Affairs Unit in Doha could adopt a more discreet approach
      to engaging with the Taliban. Alternatively, the administration could appoint
      a new special representative with the authority to build relationships and respond
      to changes within Afghanistan. A supplementary change could be to consider establishing
      an “Interests Section” in Kabul under the protection of a friendly nation’s embassy.


      Continue providing humanitarian aid to the Afghan people and encourage allies
      and partners to fulfill their commitments in this regard.


      Clearly communicate to the Taliban the specific steps required to restore access
      to frozen foreign exchange reserves.


      U.S. sanctions on Afghanistan’s foreign exchange reserves have devastated Afghanistan’s
      economy, affecting civilians and women. Yet, the Biden administration has not
      offered a clear and feasible pathway for behavioral change or diplomatic concessions
      to restore access to these reserves. Humanitarian aid alone will not address Afghanistan’s
      poverty without a functioning economy.


      Global South


      Sarang Shidore


      Strategic Outlook


      The global order is becoming less unipolar, not just because of the rise of China
      but also due to the assertion and increased salience of the Global South. In the
      future, U.S. global influence and domestic prosperity will depend as much on the
      Global South as on relations with the great powers. Today, Global South states
      have options beyond the United States, which requires a proactive approach from
      Washington. Moreover, some theaters in the developing world, such as the Sahel
      and the Philippines, have an active U.S. troop presence, which is at risk from
      the possible outbreak or escalation of conflict.


      In other words, ignoring the Global South is not sustainable from the point of
      view of U.S. security and prosperity. When global crises such as pandemics or
      financial instability arrive — or better still, in order to prevent them — engaging
      with the Global South’s middle powers, in particular, will be even more important.
      Thus, the United States needs to pay attention to its relationship with the Global
      South. The emphasis ought to be on key middle powers, such as Mexico, Brazil,
      South Africa, India, and Indonesia, and developing countries or regions where
      U.S. troops are currently deployed, such as the Sahel and the Philippines.


      Global South states aim to rise and “catch up” in economic and status terms with
      the wealthier world and prefer multialignment or nonalignment with respect to
      the great powers. Global South states generally pursue their own interests and
      seek better relations with the United States independent of their relations with
      other powers.


      The United States could achieve productive relations with the Global South by
      identifying common interests and forging win-win deals rather than pushing self-defeating
      ideological preferences or seeking to rewire the domestic economies of these states.
      Ideological pursuits or entanglements in nonvital conflicts could also blow back,
      risk U.S. troops, and hurt American interests.


      Recommendations


      Pull back from over-militarization and bloc formation and accept the reality of
      the Global South’s new nonalignment.


      While the United States often views the Global South in terms of whether it is
      aligned with the United States or China in “strategic competition,” these states
      do not view the world that way. Their priority is to rise in the international
      system by leveraging all major power relationships. The United States should avoid
      framing the meta-region primarily through the lens of U.S. rivalry with Russia
      and China and deemphasize bloc formation or militarization in Asia, Africa, and
      Latin America. While allies and partners in the Global South should be supported
      in terms of their legitimate defense needs, pushing for confrontation with Russia
      or China, especially through direct interventions and military bloc formation
      — such as in the Sahel and the Philippines/South China Sea — will only yield limited
      success with some states and could lead to a rise in anti–U.S. political sentiments
      in others.


      A smarter strategy would be to focus on these relationships chiefly in terms of
      their bilateral content, aiming to achieve good deals for the United States in
      sustainable ways. This implies that the deals should benefit the Global South
      states as well.


      Pull back on the reflexive and heavy use of unilateral sanctions.


      Unilateral sanctions, particularly their secondary variant, are deeply resented
      by most Global South states. Secondary sanctions are also illegal under international
      law. In recent decades, Washington has used the sanctions tool heavily and often
      reflexively, without a clear strategy for achieving its objectives. At this point,
      such sanctions are causing major humanitarian suffering as well as pushing Global
      South states to try and de-dollarize. Though their efforts are unlikely to bear
      fruit soon, this speaks to the unsustainable nature of U.S. strategy, as Russia
      and China rarely use such an approach to further their interests.


      After a careful evaluation of the costs and benefits, Washington ought to pull
      back on most unilateral sanctions and only employ the tool sparingly. As part
      of this analysis, the costs should include the impacts of sanctions on ordinary
      citizens of the target state.


      Pursue a strategy that is based on energizing trade and investment with the Global
      South’s growing middle powers.


      Most Global South states are not looking for handouts or aid, but investment and
      trade. Many of these states are growing faster than the United States and host
      a growing, younger population and abundant natural resources.


      Investing in and supporting U.S. firms is a good thing, and there is space for
      a well-designed industrial policy that prioritizes the well-being of U.S. domestic
      manufacturing. At the same time, a more open global trading and investment regime
      tends to benefit all parties. Washington should meet the Global South part of
      the way in energizing more trade and investment. This should be pursued bilaterally
      and, preferably, by revitalizing the World Trade Organization–based system.


      Democratizing Foreign Policy


      Ben Freeman


      Strategic outlook


      All too often, U.S. foreign policy is driven by special interests rather than
      the interests of the nation as a whole. Foreign powers and government contractors
      spend billions of dollars every year on lobbying, public relations, and other
      methods to steer U.S. foreign policy in more militarized directions. We must democratize
      U.S. foreign policy to ensure that the will of the people, not war profiteers,
      guide U.S. international affairs. To do that, we have to foster a more informed
      and robust citizen engagement with foreign affairs and build greater public support
      for diplomacy and restraint by exposing the private, corporate, and foreign interests
      that promote militaristic U.S. policies. We must also work closely with Congress
      and the media to expose the conflicts of interest inherent in many of the foreign
      policy experts they rely on.


      Recommendations


      Request think tanks disclose all corporate and foreign government funding sources.


      Unless and until legislation passes to require think tank funding transparency,
      the executive branch should formally request that think tanks publicly disclose
      this information on their websites. In 2020, during Trump’s first term, his secretary
      of state released a statement that read: “To protect the integrity of civil society
      institutions, the [State] Department requests henceforth that think tanks and
      other foreign policy organizations that wish to engage with the department disclose
      prominently on their websites funding they receive from foreign governments, including
      state-owned or state-operated subsidiary entities.” However, in 2023 the Biden
      administration stopped requesting this level of disclosure, with no explanation.


      Close the revolving door between government and lobbying firms and contractors.


      The revolving door, in which members of Congress, their staff, and high-ranking
      Pentagon officials transition almost instantly from serving the government to
      lobbying it, enriches the powerful while endangering U.S. national security. Elon
      Musk saw the dangers of the revolving door firsthand in 2014 when his firm, Space-X,
      was repeatedly denied U.S. government contracts. “Essentially we’re asking them
      to award a contract to a company where they are probably not going to get a job,
      against a company where their friends are,” Musk explained to The Washington Post.


      A substantial cooling-off period between moving from the Pentagon or Congress
      to the arms industry would mean that key contacts with former colleagues would
      be less useful as personnel in the executive branch turn over. The administration
      should require, as a condition of employment, cooling-off periods for all relevant
      national security-related positions of at least four years, extended from the
      current norm of one to two years.


      To prevent the politicization of “foreign influence” charges, make clear that
      the issue of concern is a true agency relationship with a foreign government.


      Since 2016, we have seen substantial politicization of vague and unclear charges
      of “foreign influence” in an attempt to discredit domestic political opponents.
      Such efforts were frequently made against Trump and his Republican supporters.
      To prevent such partisan misuse of national security claims, the administration
      should promulgate regulations and support legislation that makes clear that the
      application of the Foreign Agents Registration Act and actions by the intelligence
      community are aimed at cases where there is a true agency relationship — that
      is, funding by a foreign principal that is granted or withheld based on support
      for positions selected by the foreign funder. Further, such enforcement should
      take place on an impartial basis against all sources of foreign influence.'

  - title: The West and Georgia’s Crisis
    url: https://quincyinst.org/research/the-west-and-georgias-crisis/
    text: 'Executive Summary Until recently, Georgia was often held up in the West as
      an example of a relatively healthy post-Soviet democracy. For example, the Atlantic
      Council report “2024 Atlas: Freedom and Prosperity Around the World” rated Georgia
      in the top quarter of all nations for the health of its democratic institutions,
      ahead of countries like Poland and Ukraine. Yet, in advance of this month’s Georgian
      parliamentary election, claims are being made that the ruling Georgian Dream party
      is falling under the control of Moscow, and that Georgia is on the edge of sliding
      into autocracy. Both the U.S. and the E.U. have begun to put sanctions in place
      against Georgia. What happened? In this research brief, we give a background analysis
      of the current challenges to Georgian democracy. We explore the history of Georgia’s
      democracy over the past several decades, conditions leading into the upcoming
      election, recent controversies such as the “foreign influence” law put forward
      by the ruling party, and the Georgian government’s reluctance to take a stronger
      line against Russia over the Ukraine war. We argue that a fuller examination supports
      a more balanced view of Georgia’s situation, one that avoids an extreme black-and-white
      perspective on Georgian politics and the current election. Claims that the ruling
      party has fully embraced a Putin-like authoritarianism, or that it has even fallen
      under Russia’s direct control, seem highly exaggerated given Georgia’s recent
      history of real — if imperfect — democracy, and evidence of the government’s desire
      to cooperate with the West and join the E.U. Unfortunately, it remains true that
      heated rhetoric on both sides has raised the stakes of the coming elections, and
      increased the likelihood of a new political crisis that could destabilize Georgia
      and potentially risk its relationship with the West. The Georgian government has
      threatened to ban opposition parties after the election, while the opposition
      has implied that if they do not accept the results of the elections, they will
      attempt to overturn them through street demonstrations. Western governments should
      seek to avoid playing into this spiral of mutual radicalization between opposing
      political sides in Georgia and stress the importance of the Georgian people deciding
      their own future through democratic means. Western analysts should also appreciate
      the objective imperatives created for Georgian policymakers by Georgia’s geographical
      position bordering on Russia and its economic ties to Russia. The U.S. and the
      E.U. can best honor Georgians’ right to self-determination by supporting election
      monitoring by objective international observers, and by committing to respect
      the election’s outcome. Georgian democracy would be hurt, not helped, if the West
      supports efforts to overturn an election result due to dissatisfaction with its
      outcome.


      Introduction


      In the recent Atlantic Council report “2024 Atlas: Freedom and Prosperity Around
      the World,” Georgia was rated as “free” and ranked in the top quarter of all nations,
      ahead of countries like Poland and Ukraine, for the health and freedom of its
      democratic institutions.1Until very recently, this positive assessment of Georgian
      democracy was hardly unusual. The foreword to a 2020 volume, Georgia: From Autocracy
      to Democracy, edited by Stephen Jones and Neil MacFarlane, two respected experts
      on Georgia, stated that “Georgia, despite the immense challenges it faced, has
      become the strongest and most stable democracy in the former USSR (leaving aside
      the Baltic republics).”2


      Yet, as we write this a few weeks before the highly anticipated Georgian parliamentary
      elections on Oct. 26, there are widespread claims that Georgia is in imminent
      danger of a collapse into autocracy. Critics claim that the ruling Georgian Dream
      party is steering a course to make Georgia a pawn of Moscow and institute a Putin-style
      dictatorship through measures like a new requirement for non-governmental organizations,
      NGOs, to register as entities “pursuing the interests of a foreign power” if they
      receive more than 20 percent of their funding from abroad.3Testifying recently
      before the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Eka Gigauri, the head of Transparency
      International Georgia and a former senior security official in a previous Georgian
      government led by Mikheil Saakashvili, stated that:


      “The authorities continue to push the red line as they proceed to enforce the
      repressive legislation to establish a Russian-style system of governance. For
      every citizen of Georgia, the upcoming elections on Oct. 26 are essentially a
      referendum on a clear choice between a democratic, prosperous European future
      and the misery of being a Russian satellite.”4


      In this brief, we seek to provide a deeper contextual background to the current
      strains in Georgian politics.


      In Section 1 of this paper, we describe Georgia’s difficult post-Soviet history
      of civil strife, war, and setbacks in the country’s development of democracy and
      the rule of law. Despite this history, Georgia has managed to achieve a real,
      if imperfect, democracy. The West should not take actions that risk encouraging
      a return to political instability.


      In Section 2 of this paper, we describe the situation around the upcoming Oct.
      26 election, which has raised the disturbing risk of a collapse in democratic
      norms.


      In Section 3, we discuss one major issue that has caused controversy leading into
      the election, namely the “foreign influence” law put forward by the ruling Georgian
      Dream party. We explain the context of this law, which is related to the prominent
      political role of some foreign-funded NGOs. These organizations have deep connections
      to Western shapers of public opinion, elected officials, and governments, and
      strong incentives to present the Georgian political situation through their own
      lens.


      In Section 4, we analyze another major issue driving tensions between the Georgian
      Dream party and the West, namely the charge that the ruling party is bringing
      Georgia too close to Russia.


      This paper argues that a fuller perspective on Georgian politics shows a democracy
      under considerable strain but one that can survive the election process and remain
      open to the West. Fundamentally, Georgian democracy will not benefit from Western
      support for efforts to overturn legitimate election results through extra-constitutional
      means. The West should stick firmly to the principle that only a majority of the
      Georgian electorate has the right to determine the country’s future in free and
      fair elections, and insist on election monitoring by qualified, objective, and
      nonpartisan international observers whose findings are respected.


      In recent months, the Georgian government has threatened to take undemocratic
      measures after the elections including, most notably, a ban on leading opposition
      political parties, while the opposition has implied that, if they lose, they may
      allege fraud and attempt to overturn the election results through street demonstrations.
      If opposition parties are actually banned, it would clearly justify a reevaluation
      of Western relations with Georgia, such as halting the E.U. accession process.
      But we should also recognize that movements to overthrow elected governments through
      street power are very likely to lead to authoritarian responses.


      Section 1: Georgian politics since independence


      Georgia has experienced a difficult political history since its independence from
      Soviet rule in 1991. In the early 1990s, Georgia experienced several episodes
      of civil war between opposing political factions. The country was dominated by
      highly criminalized nationalist militias for several years thereafter. Georgia,
      which had once been one of the most prosperous Soviet republics, experienced steep
      economic decline and mass poverty, which persists to this day. Order was ultimately
      restored under the leadership of former Georgian Communist Party chief (and Soviet
      Foreign Minister) Eduard Shevardnadze, but his rule involved high levels of corruption,
      cronyism, economic stagnation, and significant manipulation of election results.


      Mass street protests against rigged elections — the “Rose Revolution” — led to
      Shevardnadze’s ouster in 2003 and to the eight-year administration of his successor,
      Mikheil Saakashvili. Assisted by copious Western aid, Saakashvili introduced a
      reform program that improved the Georgian economy and basic aspects of state performance.
      However, Saakashvili’s reform program — semi-authoritarian, free market liberalization
      — followed a playbook inspired more by Dubai and Singapore than the European Union.


      This style of reform went hand in hand with large-scale violations of the rule
      of law including, for example, mass expropriations. The government also suppressed
      protests with considerable brutality while senior officials engaged in severe
      violence against political opponents.5Plea bargaining — introduced in 2004 as
      a means to shake down corruption suspects and generate revenue for the budget
      — served as an all-purpose incarceration machine, tripling the number of prison
      inmates until Georgia’s prison population became one of the highest worldwide.6One
      Western observer commented at the time:


      Penal excess and the abuse of the wider criminal justice system have, since the
      Rose Revolution of late 2003, been central to understanding Georgian politics
      and society. It can be said that the model of governance, and even economy, adopted
      in the post-revolutionary period by the administration of Mikheil Saakashvili
      depends on this system.7


      In 2008, Georgia was offered the prospect of eventual NATO membership, though
      at an indeterminate date and with no immediate Membership Action Plan.8However,
      Saakashvili’s attempt to recover the separatist territory of South Ossetia by
      force in Aug. 2008 led to a disastrous defeat at the hands of Russia. The territories
      of South Ossetia and Abkhazia — de facto outside the control of Tbilisi since
      before or shortly after Georgia’s independence — have remained so to this day.


      In his last years in power, Saakashvili’s United National Movement, UNM, government
      became increasingly authoritarian and more willing to use force against protesters.9However,
      in 2012 the Georgian Dream party, GD, replaced the UNM government in a peaceful
      transition of power following an electoral defeat. A number of UNM officials then
      moved into prominent NGOs. Sergi Kapanadze, for example, the former deputy foreign
      minister under Saakashvili, now heads the NGO think tank Georgia’s Reforms Associates,
      GRASS; Nodar Kharshiladze, the former defense minister under UNM, now leads the
      Georgian Strategic Analysis Center; and Eka Gigauri, a former senior official
      in the customs and border police under UNM, leads Transparency International Georgia.10


      Saakashvili eventually moved to Ukraine and was appointed by then-Ukrainian President
      Petro Poroshenko as governor of Odessa (2015–16). Saakashvili was later sacked
      and expelled from Ukraine, and in October 2021 secretly returned to Georgia. He
      was arrested so he could serve the sentence he received in an earlier trial for
      abuse of office, and to this day remains under a form of house arrest. The GD
      government has come under considerable Western pressure to release him on human
      rights grounds.11However, the European Court of Human Rights ruled that no violation
      of any procedural or other human rights alleged in Saakashvili’s application occurred,
      confirming that the trial was fair.12Separately, it ruled that there were no human
      rights or health grounds to release Saakashvili.13


      Since coming to power in 2012, all GD governments have been dominated, either
      openly or behind the scenes, by GD’s founder, leader, and financier, Bidzina Ivanishvili
      (prime minister, 2012-13). Ivanishvili is a businessman and Georgia’s richest
      man, having made a fortune in Russia in the 1990s before transferring it to the
      West and Georgia.14 In 2012, Ivanishvili’s personal wealth was more than the entire
      Georgian state budget for that year, giving him immense influence.15Ivanishvili
      initially backed the Rose Revolution, and for several years afterward played a
      prominent role in financially supporting reforms and repairs to dilapidated public
      infrastructure by the Saakashvili government.16However, he broke with Saakashvili
      several years into his rule. Ivanishvili has been a controversial figure, but
      Georgian Dream has been able to retain its parliamentary majorities through elections
      in 2016 and 2020.


      The parliamentary elections of 2020 led to a significant political crisis with
      considerable implications for future developments in Georgian politics. The election
      was marred by allegations of voter intimidation and controversy over election
      rules. However, a key international monitoring mission by the Organization for
      Security and Cooperation in Europe, OSCE, certified that GD had comfortably won
      the largest share of votes, stating that the elections:


      Were competitive and, overall, fundamental freedoms were respected. Nevertheless,
      pervasive allegations of pressure on voters and blurring of the line between the
      ruling party and the state reduced public confidence in some aspects of the process.
      The elections were conducted under a substantially revised legal framework that
      provided a sound basis for holding democratic elections, but further efforts to
      address shortcomings are needed.17


      Nonetheless, the opposition refused to accept the election’s results, refused
      to enter Parliament, and launched mass protests. The E.U. eventually dispatched
      its council president, Charles Michel, to mediate between the opposition and GD.18The
      resulting deal included provisions for judicial reform; changes to electoral representation
      rules; an amnesty for opposition members charged with fomenting violence in street
      protests; a guaranteed opposition share of the leadership of parliamentary committees;
      and a provision for automatic and new parliamentary elections if the ruling party
      received less than 43 percent of the vote in upcoming municipal elections.19While
      pragmatic, this agreement could be seen as more of an externally administered
      solution than a fully democratic one. Although the deal succeeded in ending the
      immediate crisis, it did not last. UNM deputies refused to sign the deal and boycotted
      Parliament. In response, GD declared the deal failed and withdrew from it.20


      During this extended 2020–21 political crisis, some Western-funded NGOs played
      a leading role in supporting the opposition’s protests against the election results
      and in lobbying the West for support to overturn them. Thus, in April 2021 a group
      of Western-funded NGOs — including Transparency International Georgia, the Georgian
      Young Lawyers’ Association, the International Society for Fair Elections and Democracy,
      the Open Society Georgia Foundation, and Liberal Academy Tbilisi — wrote to the
      U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee asking for U.S. support to force the Georgian
      Dream government to share power with the opposition and implement reforms.21


      In June 2022, after the invasion of Ukraine, the E.U. accepted Ukraine and Moldova
      as candidates for membership but did not extend this to Georgia. The E.U. Commission
      said that it required further reform in the areas of governance, justice, tackling
      organized crime, respecting human rights and minorities, and the rule of law.22


      But by the E.U.’s own assessment of technical progress, Georgia was well ahead
      of Moldova and Ukraine in its progress toward membership requirements at that
      time.23The E.U. was not alone in its assessment of Georgia’s progress toward democracy.
      In its 2024 “freedom score” rankings, the Atlantic Council ranked Georgia as “free,”
      with a score ahead not just of other applicants to join the E.U., such as Ukraine,
      but of two existing members of the E.U. — Poland and Hungary.24Other U.S. NGOs
      have given similar assessments. For example, the 2023 Transparency International
      “Corruption Perceptions Index” ranked Georgia 49th in the world, ahead of E.U.
      members Greece, Romania, and Bulgaria.25Similarly, the 2023 World Justice Project
      “Rule of Law Index” ranked Georgia 48th, ahead of E.U. members Bulgaria and Hungary,
      and ahead of E.U. applicants Ukraine and Moldova.26


      Despite a difficult post-Soviet history, therefore, Georgia has managed to emerge
      in recent decades with something close to an intact democracy. Despite Saakashvili’s
      authoritarian tendencies, the UNM government did step down in 2012 in response
      to a fair election. It also appears that the Georgian Dream government won legitimate
      elections in 2016 and 2020. Still, there is the risk that the upcoming 2024 elections
      could be even more destabilizing than past Georgian elections and could pose a
      significant threat to Georgia’s tentative grip on its democracy. Tensions between
      the governing party and the opposition and significantly increased U.S.–Russia
      hostility has strained Georgian politics. In the following sections we discuss
      the 2024 elections and the two major contributors to controversy surrounding them:
      the “foreign influence” law and the charges that the Georgian Dream party has
      grown too close to Moscow.


      Section 2: The 2024 elections


      Some 27 parties have officially registered for the Oct. 26 parliamentary elections,
      where the newly instituted fully proportional electoral system will require a
      5 percent vote threshold for a party to take their seats in Parliament.27The political
      opposition will be dominated by four pro-Western coalitions alongside numerous
      individual parties. There is the UNM-led “Unity to Save Georgia” coalition, as
      well as the “Strong Georgia” and “Coalition for Change” blocs, the latter of which
      is led by several former UNM officials. The “For Georgia” coalition led by Giorgi
      Gakharia, a former GD prime minister from 2019–21, polls at roughly the same level
      as “Strong Georgia” and “Coalition for Change.”


      If the opposition parties united, they could defeat GD, whose support has declined
      in recent years (although, according to opinion polls, GD is still the strongest
      individual party and retains some 40 to 50 percent support).28The opposition is,
      however, deeply divided along lines of personality, policy, and attitudes toward
      Mikheil Saakashvili and the UNM’s authoritarian record in government before 2012.
      After Saakashvili was arrested on his return to Georgia in 2021 and convicted
      of abuse of power, President Salome Zourabishvili declared that she would never
      pardon him.29Saakashvili’s release is one issue that divides the opposition parties
      in particular. While the UNM demands Saakashvili’s release, other opposition parties
      oppose it. This is one reason President Zourabishvili’s attempts to create a united
      opposition front have met severe obstacles. According to a report for the German
      Marshall Fund of the U.S., “The former ruling UNM is widely viewed as a poison
      pill, with other parties refusing to unite with them. UNM is the largest opposition
      party and has a loyal base but is toxic to many voters due to past grievances
      from the party’s time in power.”30


      Despite the above differences, Georgia’s opposition blocs and parties are agreed
      in accusing the Georgian Dream government of three cardinal sins:


      Policies and statements that are derailing the country’s pathway toward the E.U.


      Enhancing the autocratic nature of the state at the expense of society and the
      political opposition.


      Seeking to appease Russia in various ways and drawing Georgia too close to Moscow.


      The political opposition has also agreed on framing this election as a basic referendum
      on Georgia’s future.31Tinatin (Tina) Bokuchava, the chair of the UNM, has summed
      it up as a choice “between a free, prosperous European future, or a Putin-style
      authoritarian government that plans to eradicate the opposition … and push away
      the West.”32Some have even implied that election results must be overturned through
      extra-constitutional means if necessary. Zurab Japaridze, an opposition politician,
      recently stated: “This government must be replaced. … The streets and protests
      is the only way. I don’t know how much readiness there is now, but in any case
      we are already consulting with other parties and the civil sector.”33


      This sort of black-and-white framing has had success in certain sections of Georgian
      society, and even greater success among U.S. and E.U. policymakers and journalists.
      But its appeal in the Georgian population as a whole is more questionable.34As
      one Georgia-based Western researcher and Georgian Dream critic recently wrote,
      “this approach risks overlooking the deeper concerns of many Georgians and playing
      into the ruling Georgian Dream party’s divisive rhetoric.”35As Irakli Kupradze,
      secretary-general of Strong Georgia, has said on this point: “A part of the opposition
      has swallowed this bait and reduced the election only to its geopolitical significance,
      which we believe is wrong.”36Georgia has made notable economic gains under the
      Georgian Dream government but it still remains a poor country.37For this reason,
      many ordinary Georgians are likely to view the elections in terms of domestic
      economic issues. According to a 2023 survey commissioned by the U.S. National
      Democratic Institute:


      Poverty and economic problems are identified as main contributors to a sense of
      insecurity — a finding that transcends party lines. Although a plurality acknowledges
      improvement in healthcare, freedom of speech, and women’s rights and education,
      every second Georgian says the situation regarding poverty and crime has worsened.
      One in ten Georgians can’t afford food, while one in four can only afford food,
      but nothing else. This number is even more distressing in ethnic minority regions,
      where a quarter of residents reportedly struggle to provide food for their families.38


      In addition, the GD government has previously supported — and in its statements
      still does support — Georgia’s moving closer to the West via E.U. membership.
      The GD government has actively promoted its March 2022 application to join the
      E.U. by carrying out several of the reforms that the E.U. has asked for. In December
      2023, Georgia achieved candidate status on the condition that reforms continue.39Even
      in the face of increasing tension with the West, Ivanishvili has continued to
      support E.U. accession for Georgia.40


      Despite these glimpses of potential common ground, the stark geopolitical terms
      in which the election is being cast — the West vs. Russia — has raised the election’s
      stakes and increased the likelihood that the election may lead to a new political
      crisis with mass protests aimed at overthrowing the government. Therefore, it
      is vital that the West back and respect genuinely scrupulous, impartial, and objective
      international monitoring of the elections.


      Section 3: The NGO law and the present crisis


      In 2023, the ruling GD party submitted a law to Parliament — On Registration of
      Foreign Agents — stipulating that any NGO that received more than 20 percent of
      its funding from abroad would have to register this fact publicly, and would be
      subject to monitoring by the Justice Ministry. A slightly modified version was
      passed by Parliament in the spring of 2024.41It does not place direct limits on
      NGO activity, but led to legitimate fears in both Georgia and the West that the
      government would harass foreign-funded civil society organizations.


      The government claimed that this law corresponded to Western laws like the U.S.
      Foreign Agents Registration Act, which requires registration and transparency
      of NGOs that act as agents for foreign governments. The opposition, however, claimed
      that the law imitates Russia’s “foreign agent” law and is intended to take Georgia
      toward authoritarian rule under Russian domination.42The Georgian law does not
      function like Russia’s contemporary foreign agent regime, which is extremely repressive,
      expands far beyond NGOs to target any individual or entity designated by the government,
      does not require any foreign funding to be triggered, and subjects targeted entities
      to extremely onerous restrictions on their civil rights.43Tying the Georgian law
      exclusively to Russia also seems politically motivated given that dozens of countries,
      from Ireland to Israel to India, have passed laws requiring transparency of foreign
      funding for their NGO sector since the 1990s. Even the E.U. is currently preparing
      similar legislation.44


      Despite the lack of substantive similarity to Russia’s current foreign agent regime,
      the moniker “Russian law” proved highly effective in mobilizing Georgians, who
      fear Russian influence but would hardly protest solely in support of NGOs, which
      do not command the public’s trust. The West, including governments, the media,
      and commentators, parroted this claim.45The opposition launched mass protest movements
      against the law, which triggered violent police intervention when protesters attempted
      to storm the Georgian Parliament.46


      To see the government’s motivation for proposing the law, it is important to understand
      the role played by Western-funded NGOs in Georgian society. The NGO sector in
      Georgia is heavily Western-funded, with more than 90 percent of all funding for
      NGOs and civil society organizations coming from international donors or foreign
      aid, mostly linked to the E.U. or U.S.47Because of the weakness of the Georgian
      state and neoliberal policies instituted by successive governments, numerous roles
      that would normally be undertaken by state institutions have been farmed out to
      NGOs in civil society.


      In this poor country, this has created a well-funded NGO sector that supports,
      directly or indirectly, a sizable proportion of the Georgian well-off professional
      classes. NGOs also act as a channel through which selected members of those classes
      can move to work or study in the West. The perspective of NGO-linked commenters
      has had an outsize effect on Western media and government perceptions of Georgian
      affairs. All too often, key E.U. and U.S. figures have relied uncritically on
      the nexus of Western think tanks and Georgian NGOs for much of their analysis.48


      From the beginning of Georgian independence, Western governments and organizations
      decided to concentrate on NGOs as a key area and tool of Western influence and
      reform in the former USSR. But while they are tremendously significant among the
      educated classes and in the reporting of Western analysts, their roots in Georgian
      society are questionable. According to a recent Asian Development Bank report:


      Another problem for civil society organizations [CSOs] is the lack of public trust,
      due to the mismatch between the issues CSOs work on and the issues considered
      important by the public. According to a 2017 public opinion survey, 23 percent
      of the Georgian population trusted CSOs, 10 percent fully distrusted them, and
      39 percent did not express any opinion one way or the other.49


      Other longitudinal survey projects back up this low public trust in NGOs.50As
      Stephen Jones, founding director of Georgian studies at Harvard University’s Davis
      Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies, has put it: “Civil society in Georgia
      is both strong and weak. It’s very visible, and we hear it in the West — that’s
      important. On the other hand, it doesn’t have that much support in Georgian society
      as a whole.”51


      A decisive element that defines the conflict between NGOs and the ruling party
      is the partisan role that many NGOs have taken. As previously discussed, many
      opposition UNM party members have moved directly into the NGO sector, and various
      NGOs have been agitating for the overthrow of the government. For example, in
      summer 2022, Western-funded NGOs demanded that the GD-led government resign from
      power immediately without new elections, and that it be replaced by a new “technocratic”
      caretaker government to guide Georgia toward membership of the E.U.52At least
      some of the NGOs making this demand were funded by E.U. and U.S. taxpayers, for
      example, via the European funding of the NGO “Shame Movement.”53According to a
      report for Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty:


      If Prime Minister Irakli Garibashvili and his cabinet don’t resign to make way
      for a caretaker government ‘of national consent’ by July 3, the Shame Movement
      has vowed to raise protests that have already mobilized tens of thousands of Georgians
      to a ‘larger stage.’ … Shame and its NGO allies are gambling that they can leverage
      their limited foothold on Georgian society into a sustained push to reform and
      ‘de-oligarchize’ their Black Sea nation of nearly 4 million people.54


      More recently, the Georgian government has alleged that the U.S. was encouraging
      regime change in Georgia by funding USAID training of Georgians by Serbian activists
      who had played a part in toppling the government of President Slobodan Milosevic.55


      It is also true, however, that the “foreign influence” law requires registration
      of all civil society organizations receiving foreign funding, which spreads far
      beyond the most politically active NGOs. Regardless of the Georgian government’s
      motivation for the law, Washington has reacted strongly. In response to the passage
      of the law and the police response to protests against it, the U.S. announced
      sanctions against, and visa restrictions on, members of the Georgian government;
      a comprehensive review of the U.S.–Georgia relationship; postponed joint military
      exercises; and suspended $95 million of assistance that “directly benefits the
      Government of Georgia.”56Congress is considering legislation proposing further
      measures.57Most importantly, according to recent reports citing U.S. officials,
      Washington is preparing sanctions against Ivanishvili as “concerns mount over
      his role in deepening ties with Russia and steering the country away from its
      democratic path.”58


      For its part, the E.U. has suspended all high-level meetings with Georgian officials,
      frozen Georgia’s accession process to the bloc — as well as the distribution of
      some financial assistance — and is also considering further steps dependent on
      postelection developments.59While Brussels and Washington are keen to tailor their
      policy responses solely against the government and its allies in an effort to
      avoid alienating a largely pro-Western Georgian public, some E.U. countries have
      pushed for a suspension of the bloc’s visa-free policy with Georgia.60


      The back and forth between partisan, Western-funded NGOs and attempts by the ruling
      party to delegitimize them through legal requirements for registration and monitoring
      has contributed to a spiral of radicalism in Georgian politics and disrupted relations
      with the West. President Zourabishvili, who was endorsed by the Georgian Dream
      in the 2018 election but has since become a leading voice against the ruling party,
      said that the E.U.’s decision to halt Georgia’s accession was in response to the
      “anti-European and anti-Western rhetoric and actions” by the Georgian Dream government.61For
      its part, Ivanishvili and the GD government have become much more explicitly critical
      of the West in their rhetoric and have threatened authoritarian measures. They
      talk of a “global war party” that they claim is seeking to undermine their government
      and push the country into another war with Russia.62Ivanishvili has explicitly
      threatened to ban opposition parties if GD wins the elections, which would further
      polarize Georgian politics and, of course, threaten core democratic values.63


      In sum, a spiral of mutual radicalization appears to have set in. This process
      was set in motion by UNM’s rallying of its allies in Congress and the European
      Parliament since losing power in 2012. The West has moved behind the line of the
      NGO-linked opposition, which has hindered opportunities to encourage balanced
      solutions to conflict between the parties.64This process was then given a tremendous
      extra boost by the Russian invasion of Ukraine and a new Western determination
      to roll back Russian influence wherever this could be achieved.


      Section 4: Georgia, Russia, and the West


      The increasing tension between the Georgian government and the West also needs
      to be understood in the context of Russia’s 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
      The invasion led to Western pressure on Georgia to take a stronger stand against
      Russia, including by imposing sanctions on Russia that fully matched E.U. and
      U.S. sanctions. The E.U. and U.S. also requested that Georgia deliver much of
      its Soviet-era weaponry and equipment to Ukraine, as this could be done much faster
      than supplying Western arms.65


      The GD government did denounce the Russian invasion and voted in the United Nations
      to condemn it. However, Georgia did not participate in some of the stronger measures
      urged by the E.U. and the United States. Georgia also did not fully join in E.U.
      economic sanctions, and rejected calls for arms deliveries to Ukraine. In June
      2022, the European Parliament called for imposing personal sanctions on Ivanishvili
      for encouraging “ambiguous relations with Russia.”66


      The great majority of the Western media and commentariat have since sided with
      the Georgian opposition in portraying the GD government as agents of Moscow.67The
      U.S., E.U., and most Western governments are now openly hostile to the GD government.
      This hostility will obviously intensify greatly if new opposition protests lead
      to intensified repression and real dictatorship. And given what they increasingly
      see as implacable Western hostility, GD may, in the end, feel that they would
      benefit by drawing closer to Russia, despite the inherent risks — thus turning
      Western fears of Georgia moving toward Moscow into a self-fulfilling prophecy.


      However, we have not yet reached this point. A balanced assessment of GD policies
      toward Russia should factor in Georgia’s challenging geopolitical situation, as
      well as efforts by Georgia to oppose Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.


      Before relations with the West began to deteriorate radically as a result of the
      Ukraine conflict, the U.S. and E.U. actually supported Georgian government efforts
      to establish reasonable working relations with a wide range of partners, by combining
      partnership with the U.S. and E.U. with improved relations with Russia. For some
      years this “multivector” policy worked well. Under GD governments, Georgia was
      able to stabilize relations with Russia (despite the absence of formal diplomatic
      ties as a result of the 2008 conflict), while still maintaining strong relations
      with the U.S. When GD took power in 2012, they sought to improve economic relations
      with Russia, and the share of Georgian exports to Russia rose from 2 percent to
      15 percent of total exports by 2017. At the same time, a 2018 Congressional Research
      Service report still identified Georgia as “one of the United States’ closest
      partners among post-Soviet states,” stating that “With a history of strong economic
      aid and security cooperation, the United States and Georgia have deepened their
      strategic partnership.”68


      Thus, Georgia has sought to become part of what CIA Director William Burns has
      called the “hedging middle” and what others refer to as a “multivector” foreign
      policy, which maintains relationships with a wide range of countries according
      to the official view of what constitutes national interests.69This is the approach
      being followed by Mongolia and several former Soviet states in Central Asia: They
      do not wish to break with the West, but they are equally determined not to be
      pushed into hostility with Russia or China.70


      The pressure against nations seeking to chart any version of a middle course between
      the U.S. and its rivals has multiplied greatly since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
      Georgia has joined U.S. efforts against the invasion in a number of ways, even
      though it has not fully joined in sanctions against Russia or agreed to deliver
      arms to Ukraine. In an interview with one of the authors of this brief, a senior
      official in previous Georgian governments, Petre Mamradze, said:


      GD voted in the Council of Europe to stop Russia’s membership, then voted to expel
      Russia from the Council of Europe in 2022, then voted in the U.N. General Assembly
      to condemn Russia for the invasion. … They did even a crazy thing — GD and 34
      UNM deputies asked the ICC to start a case against Putin as a war criminal. Neither
      Azerbaijan nor Armenia ever voted against Russia. They either abstained or walked
      out.71


      An additional source of the U.S. establishment’s unhappiness with the GD government
      is a dispute over a contract with Beijing to build a new port on the Black Sea,
      which was opposed by the U.S.72However, this contract was originally given to
      a European–U.S.–Georgian construction consortium that failed to meet critical
      construction deadlines. The International Chamber of Commerce/ICC Arbitration
      Tribunal recently upheld Georgia’s cancellation of the contract based on failure
      to complete agreed tasks.73


      It should also be understood that even though Georgia has not fully joined in
      E.U. economic sanctions, it has made efforts at partial compliance and at preventing
      the use of Georgian territory for sanctions evasion. In his 2023 visit to Georgia,
      the E.U.’s special envoy for sanctions, David O’Sullivan, said:


      We also understand the very specific situation in which Georgia finds itself both
      economically, in terms of geography, and in terms of close contacts with Russia
      in many ways. So, we understand that they’re not going to implement our [E.U.]
      sanctions. But, I have to say that what we have seen over the last two days has
      confirmed to us that the Georgian authorities are taking very seriously the issue
      of not allowing this country to be used as a platform for circumvention. And they
      have put in place significant measures of controlling the exports, of possible
      export from Georgia of the most sensitive 38 [dual use] products, and the same
      is true across financial sanctions, where they have put in place very close vigilance.
      And we are frankly impressed with the measures which they have taken.74


      Georgia is hardly alone in not joining all U.S. and E.U. sanctions. Turkey, Georgia’s
      biggest neighbor after Russia, has pursued a policy of determined neutrality toward
      the war in Ukraine.


      The economic relationship with Russia is important to Georgia. Although Georgia
      has no formal diplomatic relations with Russia, trucks going to Russia from the
      Persian Gulf and elsewhere are backed up for miles at the Georgia–Russia border.
      Russia remains a significant market for Georgian agricultural produce and wines.
      Georgia receives numerous tourists from Russia (as well as refugees fleeing the
      Putin government). Remittances from Georgians working in Russia may also play
      an important role in supporting many Georgian families, though one that is difficult
      to quantify.75


      Most Georgians continue to stress poverty and economic concerns as the most important
      factors in their lives. Nevertheless, the opposition Strong Georgia coalition
      has clearly stated that they would seek to enforce all E.U. sanctions against
      Russia, as well as restrictions on other Russo–Georgian economic interactions.76Such
      a development could harm the many Georgians who have benefited from newly expanded
      trade with Russia. While Georgians, for understandable historical reasons, have
      a deep fear of Russia, many still favor maintaining the current level of economic
      relations with their massive northern neighbor.77As one Georgian remarked to one
      of the authors, “Very few Georgians have any affection for Russia or Russians,
      but a great many Georgians want to make money off them.” According to a National
      Democratic Institute survey, 37 percent of respondents said that Georgia should
      pursue a purely pro-Western policy, 36 percent supported a pro-Western policy
      while maintaining good relations with Russia, and 8 percent wanted a pro-Russian
      policy while maintaining good relations with the West.78


      Then-Prime Minister Irakli Garibashvili said in 2023 that to impose sanctions
      against Russia would “destroy Georgia’s economy,” and pointed out that many other
      nations have continued to trade with Russia:


      The European Union trades with Russia in just four days, as much as we trade in
      a year. Where is the logic when we are called to introduce sanctions against Russia?
      Did anyone impose sanctions on Russia because of our war? No one in the world
      made a formal reaction. Where is the logic of, ‘Our war is not a war’ but in Ukraine
      it is.79


      Georgian government propaganda against the opposition is also largely concentrated
      on the allegation that it will drag Georgia into a new war with Russia, as part
      of a “global party of war.”80This warning may seem exaggerated, but it resonates
      deeply with many Georgians, including even opposition supporters. As an opposition
      supporter and former MP told one of the authors, “Ukraine did not fight for us
      in 2008, so we are under no obligation to fight for Ukraine today.”


      However, the combination of requests to send Georgian arms to Ukraine, and the
      promotion by some opposition politicians of a “Georgian Legion” of volunteers
      to fight in Ukraine, have led to fears that the opposition may support policies
      that could risk escalation with Russia, even if inadvertently.81


      If present Georgian policy toward Russia is solidly grounded in pragmatism, therefore,
      it is also true that a certain distrust of the U.S. has grown over the years —
      even among pro-Western Georgians. Although both the Georgian government and most
      ordinary Georgians remain committed in principle to seeking NATO membership, no
      individual interviewed by the authors for this paper expressed confidence that
      NATO would, in fact, fight for Georgia in the event of a war. This skepticism
      dates to the Georgian–Russian War of 2008. The Bush administration had offered
      future NATO membership to Georgia, and U.S. officials and politicians had spoken
      of Georgia as a U.S. ally. Yet the U.S. did not come to Georgia’s aid.


      Attitudes toward the E.U. are much more positive, both because of the hoped-for
      economic and migration benefits of membership and because the idea of belonging
      to “Europe” is deeply embedded in Georgian culture. But doubts about Western commitment
      have been increased by domestic political developments in both Europe and the
      U.S., indicating greater public opposition to further NATO and E.U. enlargement.


      Like the Hungarian, Slovak, and previous Polish governments, GD has also adopted
      an increasingly “sovereignist” rhetoric, emphasizing Georgia’s right as an independent
      nation to set its own policies, defend its national interests, and maintain its
      own national culture. This includes policies toward sexual minorities and women’s
      rights that are seen as alien to core Georgian traditions and are bitterly opposed
      by the Georgian Orthodox Church.82This is now being portrayed in the West as an
      aspect of the GD government’s supposed alignment with Moscow — though, ideologically
      speaking, it could equally well be called alignment with much of the U.S. Republican
      Party.83On the other hand, the overwhelming majority of Georgians continue strongly
      to support E.U. membership, which they associate, somewhat unrealistically, with
      immediate higher incomes, greater social protection, and emigration into high-paying
      jobs.


      Conclusion


      For years, Georgia was an imperfect but real success story for democracy in the
      post-Soviet space. Now, however, political conflict threatens to plunge Georgia
      into deep instability.


      The U.S. and E.U. should recognize the complexity and fragility of the situation
      and resist pressure to further increase the polarization of Georgian society and
      politics. The U.S. and E.U. should insist on and support close, scrupulous, and
      objective monitoring of the upcoming elections by international observers from
      the OSCE and other independent organizations, and should commit themselves to
      accept their conclusions. Only if these impartial observers conclude that the
      vote is clearly rigged should its results be rejected.


      The West should avoid a black-and-white contrast between feuding parties in Georgian
      politics and understand that the messages received from the various sides, including
      by interested actors in the NGO sector, may be slanted by self-interest. In the
      recent past, Georgia has been able to conduct fair elections, maintain a close
      relationship with the United States, and make substantial progress toward meeting
      the requirements for E.U. membership. These possibilities still exist but may
      be impossible to attain if the U.S. and E.U. reject any possibility of rapprochement
      with Georgia — so long as it is ruled by GD.


      This assessment may seem overly optimistic at a time when the E.U. has frozen
      the accession process for Georgia and the U.S. has recently levied sanctions on
      members of the ruling party. If the GD moves toward outright authoritarianism
      by, for example, banning opposition parties, then E.U. membership should be out
      of the question. But based on the evidence presented in this paper, the claim
      that Georgia is already in the hands of a pro-Putin authoritarian government is,
      at best, highly exaggerated. A more nuanced perspective is justified based on
      the complexity of internal Georgian politics and the reality of Georgia’s geopolitical
      situation.'

      tensions between the government and opposition, which is fragmented yet united
      in its opposition to the ruling party's policies. The controversial "foreign influence"

  - title: Right-Sizing the Russian Threat to Europe
    url: https://quincyinst.org/research/right-sizing-the-russian-threat-to-europe/
    text: 'Executive Summary Western leaders, including U.S. President Joe Biden, have
      frequently framed the invasion of Ukraine as the first step in a Russian plan
      of broader European conquest. However, a close examination of Russian intent and
      military capabilities shows this view is dangerously mistaken. Russia likely has
      neither the capability nor the intent to launch a war of aggression against NATO
      members — but the ongoing brinkmanship between Russia and the West still poses
      serious risks of military escalation that can only be defused by supplementing
      military deterrence with a diplomatic effort to address tensions. An analysis
      of Russian security thinking demonstrates that Putin’s stated views align with
      long-standing Russian fears about Western encroachment, given Russia’s lack of
      natural barriers to invasion. As Putin has come to view NATO as increasingly hostile
      to Russia, aggressive Russian action in defense of its claimed “sphere of influence”
      has become a factor in European security. However, contrary to many Western analyses,
      this does not mean that Russia views future wars of aggression against NATO member
      states as in its security interest. This does not imply naivete about the danger
      of Russian aggression, as reflected most recently in its illegal invasion of Ukraine.
      But it highlights the fundamental differences between Russia’s perceptions of
      Ukraine, which it has long regarded as both critical to its national security
      and integral to its history and culture, and its views of NATO countries, where
      the cost-benefit balance of aggression for Russia would be very different. Understanding
      Russian incentives also requires assessing Russia’s actual military capabilities
      compared to NATO. As frequently reiterated by NATO leadership, such an assessment
      shows that Russia is at a decisive conventional military disadvantage against
      the NATO alliance. While Russia would do damage in a conventional war with NATO,
      it would almost certainly suffer a devastating defeat in such a conflict absent
      nuclear escalation. NATO has a greater than three-to-one advantage over Russia
      in active-duty ground forces. NATO also has even greater advantages in the air
      and at sea. The alliance has a ten-to-one lead in military aircraft and a large
      qualitative edge as well, raising the probability of total air superiority. At
      sea, NATO would likely have the capacity to impose a naval blockade on Russian
      shipping, whose costs would dwarf current economic sanctions. While Russia has
      clear military superiority over individual NATO states, especially in the Baltics,
      it is extremely unlikely it could exercise this advantage without triggering a
      broader war with the entire NATO alliance. However, NATO’s powerful military deterrent
      alone cannot create stability in Europe. Paradoxically, an excessive reliance
      on military deterrence is likely to increase instability by inducing Russia to
      rely increasingly on its nuclear force as its primary basis for deterrence. Unlike
      conventional forces, Russia and NATO possess roughly the same amount of nuclear
      weapons. Washington must work to defuse this increasingly unstable dynamic by
      restoring diplomatic lines of communication between Russia and the West.


      Introduction


      According to the frequent framing of Russian intentions by Western leaders, Russian
      President Vladimir Putin is plotting a war of conquest against Europe. “Putin’s
      war is about redrawing the map of Europe. But it is also a war on our Union,”
      said European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, referring to Russia’s
      2022 invasion of Ukraine.1Putin, warned U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, “will
      not stop” in Ukraine. “Quite frankly, if Ukraine falls, I really believe NATO
      will be in a fight with Russia,” Austin added.2In his June 2024 Presidential debate
      with Donald J. Trump, President Joseph P. Biden referred to Russian intent to
      conquer Poland and other NATO countries multiple times, stating that if Russia
      won in Ukraine Putin would “move on to Poland and other places.”3


      The assessment of this claim has profound implications for NATO’s future and the
      policies of its member countries. If Russia is determined on further European
      military conquests, this calls for policies based purely on resolute military
      deterrence.


      This paper argues this vision of Russia’s motivations and incentives is far too
      simplistic. A fuller, more nuanced reading of the Kremlin’s policies and strategic
      culture, as well as the incentives and disincentives created by the current military
      balance in Europe, paints a different picture of Russia’s intentions and interests
      — one that suggests that Western deterrence, while prudent and necessary, will
      be dangerously counterproductive if it is unaccompanied by a diplomatic framework
      for long-term strategic stability in Eastern Europe and the post-Soviet region.


      To fully understand Russia’s posture, it is necessary to assess the evidence of
      Russia’s stated intent and strategic goals and the objective military situation
      that Russia would face in a conflict with NATO. Is Russia, in fact, committed
      to further European conquests, or does it perceive itself as engaged in a more
      defensive posture against an already powerful NATO deterrent?


      Russian intent and strategic thinking


      There are two main empirical sources for determining what a state thinks on any
      given policy issue: relevant statements of intent by officials and patterns established
      by prior action. Yet, both can be deceiving in isolation. The former, because
      officials can lie and the latter, because history offers neither perfect analogies
      nor constant truths.4But these two factors, when considered in tandem, can offer
      an approximation of how relevant stakeholders perceive a given issue.


      Establishing intent is both straightforward and complicated when it comes to Russia.
      Such is the concentration of power in Russia’s system that the most senior Foreign
      Ministry officials and even most military leaders — as well as Russia’s wealthiest
      and most influential businessmen — did not know about the February 24, 2022 invasion
      of Ukraine before it began.5There is an inner circle of officials entrusted with
      refining and executing policies handed to them, but Putin can chart the direction
      of Russian grand strategy independent of his advisors. While Putin is attentive
      to public opinion, and popular views can limit the government’s capacity to mobilize
      support for war, his uncontested authority can also allow him to make potentially
      unpopular decisions without jeopardizing his central position in Russia’s power
      vertical.6Hence, any assessment of Russian strategic intentions must begin with
      analyses of Putin’s thinking and operational code.


      Assessments of the Kremlin’s intentions vis-a-vis its neighbors and states on
      NATO’s eastern flank are all too often premised on belligerent statements made
      by commentators on Russian state media. There is no basis for drawing a direct
      line between these sound bites and serious foreign policy discussions between
      Putin and other key Russian stakeholders.7


      Putin has spoken and written about Russian interests with a remarkable degree
      of consistency during his two-decade tenure and has systematically pursued those
      interests in ways that make it possible to establish a baseline framework for
      understanding his foreign policy agenda.


      Russia, in its present incarnation as well as its Tsarist and Soviet predecessors,
      has lacked natural boundaries. Thus, one of its principal strategic goals has
      been to carve out buffer zones against rival powers to its west and south. But
      such buffer zones, if absorbed into Russia, also become vulnerable as part of
      a new frontier between Russia and its adversaries, creating a need for additional
      buffers. This dynamic is one of the pillars in a longstanding strategic culture
      that has impelled prior cycles of Russian expansionism in Eastern Europe and parts
      of Asia. Such expansionist ventures were often conducted at the expense of Russia’s
      smaller neighbors, creating incentives for these border states to align themselves
      with Russia’s Western rivals for their security arrangements.


      This drive for expansion, which defies a neat binary between offensive and defensive
      thinking, can be mitigated in two ways: the presence of neutral border states
      administered neither by Russia nor its adversaries and a combination of formal
      and informal agreements — the international “rules of the game”— involving spheres
      of influence wherein Russia and its great power peers can play a dominant role
      without facing significant obstruction. Working in tandem, these factors encouraged
      stability throughout the Cold War and acted as guardrails, preventing the bipolar
      competition from spilling into a wider European war.8


      Putin spent his formative years in such a system and was shaped by it. He has
      long formulated Russian foreign policy around the core belief that Moscow is entitled
      to a sphere of influence that roughly comprises the post-Soviet region. This approach,
      which dovetails into the Kremlin’s concept of a “Russian world” (Russkiy mir),
      posits that Russia has the right to play an outsized military, political, and
      cultural role in that part of the Eurasian heartland — including Ukraine, Belarus,
      the South Caucasus, and Central Asia — where the Russian Empire and the former
      Soviet Union have historically been the principal geopolitical actors. Much like
      the Monroe Doctrine, this framework does not require direct Russian control over
      its claimed sphere of influence. Instead, its primary objective is to deny other
      powers, including the United States, Europe, and China, from occupying a position
      of strategic dominance in these regions.9


      Contrary to some prior assessments of Russian statecraft, there is no evidence
      that Putin perceives an existential threat from liberal democracy itself or that
      it has ever been a Russian foreign policy goal to prevent the establishment of
      such governments in the post-Soviet sphere.10In fact, Moscow has demonstrated
      no hard ideological preference in its choice of international partners and has
      a long record of cooperating with democracies across the world. Rather, Russia’s
      goal is to prevent post-Soviet states from integrating into the Western orbit
      in specific ways that the Kremlin believes pose existential threats to Russia’s
      security. These flashpoints can include attempts by a post-Soviet state to join
      NATO or to host Western military infrastructure on its territory.


      Russia’s goal is to prevent post-Soviet states from integrating into the Western
      orbit in specific ways that the Kremlin believes pose existential threats to Russia’s
      security.


      The 2008 Russo-Georgian War shows these dynamics at work. A Western-oriented Georgia
      that was promised earlier that year that it would eventually join NATO invaded
      the separatist region of South Ossetia in a bid to forcibly reunify with the province
      despite a ceasefire being in place and killed several Russian peacekeepers. Russia
      responded with a massive invasion of Georgia, rolling up toward Tbilisi with little
      resistance. Though Russia could have pushed onward, it instead chose to end hostilities
      by recognizing the runaway provinces of Abkhazia and South Ossetia as independent
      states. This accomplished two goals consistent with Russia’s grand strategy: It
      reduced the span of territory along Russia’s border with Georgia that could be
      used to host Western weaponry, and it established a frozen territorial conflict
      that prevented Georgia from joining NATO under the alliance’s rules. Russia’s
      behavior in prosecuting and terminating this conflict, therefore, shows no inherent
      drive toward territorial aggrandizement but, rather, is consistent with its attempts
      to limit and deter Western involvement in Georgia.


      There is no evidence that Russian leadership seeks to revise the status of post-Soviet
      and post-Warsaw Pact states that are already in NATO, particularly the Baltics,
      Poland, and Romania. Moscow has consistently denied any plans to attack NATO territory,
      nor does it have any ostensible reason to do so. “Russia has no reason, no interest
      — no geopolitical interest, neither economic, political nor military — to fight
      with NATO countries,” Putin said in late 2023.11“Their statements about our alleged
      intention to attack Europe after Ukraine is sheer nonsense,” he claimed in early
      2024.12


      Though the Kremlin espouses consistent hostility toward NATO, it appears to realize
      that it could not achieve its goals toward the West through direct military force
      against NATO states and has structured its policies accordingly. Trying to occupy
      any state of NATO’s eastern flank is not in Russia’s interests and contradicts
      Moscow’s core objective of reducing NATO’s military presence along Russian territory.
      These goals were spelled out in Russia’s December 2021 security ultimatum to the
      West, which called for written guarantees against NATO’s further eastward enlargement
      and limits on deployments of troops and weapons on NATO’s eastern flank.13The
      2021 ultimatum remains the purest articulation of Russia’s aims toward the West
      — not a war of conquest, but a grand bargain that establishes concrete limits
      to NATO’s force posture in Eastern Europe and explicitly acknowledges Russia’s
      right to a cultural, political, and military sphere of influence in the post-Soviet
      region.


      Though the Kremlin espouses consistent hostility toward NATO, it appears to realize
      that it could not achieve its goals toward the West through direct military force
      against NATO states and has structured its policies accordingly.


      However, Russia’s demonstrated lack of direct expansionist intent vis-à-vis NATO
      certainly does not mean it harbors no grievances against the West or that it is
      unprepared to act on those grievances in ways that challenge U.S. interests in
      NATO’s security posture.


      Indeed, in response to what he saw as hostile Western policies, Putin gradually
      abandoned the cautiously pro-Western stance that characterized his approach in
      the early 2000s. He turned to an overtly confrontational approach as part of his
      rejection of what he came to see as a U.S.-led European security architecture
      that not only does not respect Russian interests but is also explicitly arrayed
      against them.


      The nature of Russia’s current hostility to the West must be unpacked to reach
      a fuller understanding of the concrete steps Moscow is willing to take against
      the United States and its European allies.


      Putin delivered one of the earliest summations of his mounting dissatisfaction
      with Russian-Western relations in a 2007 speech given at the Munich Security Conference.
      “I think it is obvious that NATO expansion does not have any relation with the
      modernisation of the Alliance itself or with ensuring security in Europe. On the
      contrary, it represents a serious provocation that reduces the level of mutual
      trust. And we have the right to ask: against whom is this expansion intended?”
      he said.14


      The issue of perceived Western encroachment has been a focal point of mounting
      military tensions in Central and Eastern Europe. Such countries as Poland, Czechia,
      and the Baltic states, fearful that a resurgent Russia would again turn its gaze
      toward the West, petitioned to join the alliance shortly following the Soviet
      collapse. These states’ desire to integrate into the Western security sphere was
      informed in large part by centuries of historical baggage from their dealings
      with the USSR and Russian Empire. Baltic and Polish threat perceptions are driven
      by a strategic culture fundamentally hostile to Russia that sees Moscow as an
      unremitting aggressor to be contained and deterred. These perceptions, while understandable
      within the scope of Baltic and Polish history, did not comport with the realities
      of contemporary Russian foreign policy. Neither Yeltsin nor his handpicked successor,
      Vladimir Putin, had any demonstrable intention of reestablishing Russian control
      over the post-Soviet or former Warsaw Pact countries that joined NATO. On the
      contrary, Putin repeatedly sought to negotiate Russia’s participation and even
      partial integration into Western political, economic, and security structures.
      “I want Russia to be part of Western Europe. It’s our destiny,” Putin told former
      NATO Secretary General George Robertson in 2000.15


      A lack of substantive progress with these overtures, coupled with subsequent rounds
      of NATO expansion and a failure to work out a practical agreement concerning post-Soviet
      states that had not yet joined NATO, fueled Putin’s perception of the West as
      a hostile bloc that is uninterested in coexisting or meaningfully cooperating
      with Russia. These dueling perceptions — with much of NATO’s newer membership
      viewing Russia as a congenital aggressor state and Moscow fearing the continued
      expansion of what it saw as a hostile, expansionist Euro-Atlantic bloc — sparked
      a security spiral that neither side wanted, leading to the 2022 invasion of Ukraine.


      The Kremlin clearly signaled its red lines around Ukraine going back as far as
      the 1990s.16 Moscow further warned in the years following the 2014 Euromaidan
      revolution, which saw the establishment of a firmly pro-Western Ukrainian government,
      Russia’s subsequent annexation of Crimea, and the outbreak of a violent separatist
      conflict in the eastern Donbas region, that it is prepared to take drastic measures
      to prevent Ukraine from being used as a Western outpost against Russia.17Putin
      made this position explicit in a 2021 essay on the “historical unity of Russians
      and Ukrainians.” Putin claimed that the West was turning Ukraine into a kind of
      “anti-Russia,” something that the Kremlin would “never accept.”18Russia, he added,
      “will never allow our historical territories and people close to us living there
      to be used against Russia. And to those who will undertake such an attempt, I
      would like to say that this way they will destroy their own country.”19Russia’s
      fears over a Western-aligned Ukraine run deeper than the issue of NATO membership,
      as Kyiv can potentially host Western bases without formally joining the alliance.
      This, too, is seen as unacceptable by Moscow. These comments create a stark contrast
      to Putin’s rhetoric on the Baltic states and Poland — though he also condemns
      what he describes as their Russophobic and belligerent policies.20


      The ill-fated Minsk and Minsk II agreements were designed to allay Moscow’s security
      fears while upholding Ukraine’s statehood and territorial integrity. Among other
      points, the agreements provided what Moscow saw as a blueprint for the reintegration
      of the pro-Russia separatist Donetsk and Luhansk regions into Ukraine, which would
      give these regions permanent de facto veto power over Ukraine’s NATO membership
      aspirations.21


      The Kremlin concluded over the eight years that followed the signing of the Minsk
      agreements that the United States and E.U. were not going to pressure Kyiv into
      implementing their provisions, prompting Putin to devise a hybrid military-political
      solution that he believed would remove what he saw as an unremittingly anti-Russian
      government in Kyiv while simultaneously pressuring the West to negotiate over
      the larger strategic concessions Russia put forth in December 2021. Ukraine and
      the West are linked in Russian strategic thinking, though not in the abstract,
      values-driven sense of Russia’s autocratic crusade against liberal democracy.
      Rather, Moscow seeks to use its success in Ukraine as leverage to drive the United
      States and its allies to the negotiating table regarding issues pertaining to
      Europe’s security architecture.


      Russian rhetoric and behavior provide strong, consistent indications that the
      Kremlin understands it cannot achieve its objectives by attacking NATO states.


      The NATO-Russian military balance


      Russia’s stated intent is, of course, only part of the analysis. Russia’s actual
      capacity to win a military conflict with NATO is also a critical determinant of
      motivations. Even if Russia perceives its motivations as defensive, if it also
      believes it is capable of winning a war with NATO, aggression could be attractive
      from the standpoint of maintaining Russia’s buffer defense and deterrent capacity
      against perceived external enemies. If Putin believed expanding Russia’s territory
      by force was a realistic ambition, it could become part of Russia’s security thinking
      regarding NATO.


      To assess this threat, it is necessary to first dismiss the notion that the lines
      between hybrid or proxy warfare and conventional conflict have become so blurred
      that “we are already fighting the Third World War with Russia.”22An actual conventional
      conflict between Russia and the United States and its NATO allies would vastly
      differ from a “cold” political conflict or the current war between Russia and
      Ukraine. In the context of a Russian invasion of NATO, the restrictions that NATO
      has observed concerning the war in Ukraine would largely disappear, and — as in
      all wars — actions and policies would be adopted that now seem unthinkable.


      A full-scale war between Russia and NATO is the prospect addressed in this analysis.
      This is also the prospect which any Russian policymaker contemplating a direct
      attack on NATO would have to contemplate — and fear. This section considers the
      objective deterrent value of this prospect to Russian policymakers. Based on the
      balance of forces, could they expect to gain significantly more in such a conflict
      than they lose?


      There is already some evidence of Russia’s answer to this question that can be
      gleaned from its behavior in the Ukraine war. Russian threats to use nuclear weapons
      if NATO intervenes directly in Ukraine were intended to deter NATO countries from
      doing so because Moscow knows that any large-scale intervention — even if it were
      only by the air forces of the United States and other NATO countries — would doom
      Russia to defeat.23


      In the words of the Chief of the British Defence Staff, Admiral Sir Anthony Radikin:24


      “The inescapable fact is that any Russian assault or incursion against NATO would
      prompt an overwhelming response. The thousands of Allied troops currently stationed
      in Poland and the Baltic states could draw on the 3.5 million uniformed personnel
      across the Alliance for reinforcement.”


      “NATO’s combat air forces — which outnumber Russia’s 3 to 1 — would quickly establish
      air superiority. NATO’s maritime forces would bottle up the Russian Navy in the
      Barents and the Baltic, just as Ukraine pushed the Black Sea Fleet from Crimea.
      NATO has four times as many ships and three times as many submarines as Russia
      … With a collective GDP twenty times greater than Russia. And a total defence
      budget three-and-a-half times more than Russia and China combined. Plus NATO has
      the additional strategic depth of a population of over 1 billion. And sitting
      above all of this is NATO as a nuclear alliance. The biggest reason that Putin
      doesn’t want a conflict with NATO is because Russia will lose. And lose quickly.”


      Below, we flesh out Radikin’s assertion with a fuller discussion of a Russia–NATO
      conflict. Our core question is the rationality of a preplanned, intentional Russian
      ground assault on a NATO country, launched by Russia and its ally Belarus, after
      a Russian victory in the war in Ukraine.25Similar military considerations would
      also apply to a full-scale Russia–NATO conflict triggered in other ways.


      Table 1 below shows a simple estimate of the numerical count of NATO and Russian
      land, air, and sea forces drawn from the 2024 Military Balance published by the
      International Institute for Strategic Studies.26Turkish forces are not included,
      as their participation is doubtful, and no Ukrainian military forces are included
      in the NATO alliance to reflect a worst-case contingency of Ukrainian defeat.


      As Radikin points out in the above quote, on paper, NATO’s superiority appears
      overwhelming. NATO has a greater than 3:1 advantage over Russia in active-duty
      ground forces and naval vessels and a 10:1 advantage in warplanes.27Further, the
      economic capacity of the NATO alliance to sustain an extended war dwarfs that
      of Russia, as the combined GDP of NATO countries is some $60 trillion — almost
      ten times that of Russia.28


      NATO has a greater than 3:1 advantage over Russia in active-duty ground forces
      and naval vessels and a 10:1 advantage in warplanes. Further, the economic capacity
      of the NATO alliance to sustain an extended war dwarfs that of Russia.


      However, to reflect the reality of NATO’s geographic spread, as well as the possibility
      that at least some U.S. troops might be unavailable for the conflict due to commitments
      elsewhere, we have split NATO forces by zones of distance to Russia, as shown
      in the map below. Considering these zones of NATO countries, we can see that:


      Russia has an overwhelming military advantage over the national militaries of
      the Baltic states of Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia. 29


      In a conflict limited to the militaries of the “Eastern Arc” of NATO states bordering
      Russian territory, such as Poland, Hungary, Romania, and Finland, Russia would
      have a 3:1 advantage in ground forces but no advantage in naval vessels or warplanes.


      In a conflict against all European NATO countries with no U.S. involvement, Russia
      would be outnumbered 2:1 in active-duty ground forces and at a much larger disadvantage
      in air and naval forces.


      Reflecting this situation, many scenarios of a conventional Russian military threat
      to NATO frame the issue as a Russian invasion of the Baltic states.30 The implicit
      assumption is that Russia could quickly overrun these nations before assistance
      from other NATO states arrived. In such a “blitzkrieg” scenario, Russia could
      gain substantial benefits without incurring the costs of a wider war with NATO.


      However, this assumption greatly underestimates the costs to Russia of aggression
      against NATO. A variety of factors, including NATO air and naval dominance, the
      difficulty of conquering urban areas, NATO political commitments to its eastern
      border states, and Russian weaknesses revealed in the Ukraine conflict, mean that
      Russian aggression against even NATO’s weakest states would carry enormous risks
      and be unlikely to succeed.


      A critical factor driving risks to Russia is NATO air and naval dominance. Unlike
      land forces that must traverse intermediate territory, air and naval forces could
      be brought into play almost immediately. As Table 1 shows, NATO has a major advantage
      in air and naval power, with a 10:1 superiority in aircraft and a 3:1 superiority
      in naval vessels.


      While Table 1 offers only a raw count of aircraft and naval vessels associated
      with national armed forces, more detailed analyses in other sources indicate that
      NATO’s superiority over Russia in these areas is highly significant in a qualitative
      sense. For example, a recent study by the Center for Strategic and International
      Studies states that:31


      “The VKS [Russian air force] is at a distinct quantitative and qualitative disadvantage
      when compared to the combined airpower strength of NATO. Although some of Russia’s
      newest fighters have fifth-generation characteristics, none can truly be called
      fifth generation. … In an air-to-air fight, Russia would be outclassed in numbers
      and tactical ability by a NATO force. In addition to a numerical disadvantage,
      Russian forces are not as trained as NATO pilots. Despite attempted modernization,
      Russia has struggled to build a modern air force. Russia conducts little training
      at integrated air operations. Most training flights are only formations with small
      numbers of aircraft. Additionally their pilots generally fly less than 100 hours
      a year, about a third of what the average NATO pilot flies.”


      The fundamental imbalance between Russian and NATO air power has been underscored
      and intensified by the Ukraine conflict. Surprisingly, Russia has not been able
      to establish complete air superiority against Ukraine. Estimates conclude that
      its air force has lost over 25 percent of its effective combat strength in a conflict
      against a country that was not even considered to have a modern air force before
      the war.32 Based on this precedent, a full-scale conflict against NATO air power
      would likely be catastrophic.


      The situation would be similar for the Russian Navy. In a war with NATO, the Russian
      Baltic and Black Sea Fleets would be trapped. The Black Sea Fleet has already
      suffered severe damage in the Ukraine War. NATO airpower would likely speedily
      destroy the Baltic Fleet. With Sweden and Finland’s entry to NATO, NATO would
      control the surrounding Baltic coasts, in any case.


      This would leave the Russian Northern and Pacific Fleets. In a war with NATO,
      the surface units of the Northern Fleet would be hopelessly outnumbered. Russia
      has one medium-sized aircraft carrier (under refit for more than five years),
      two battle cruisers (one of which is also currently under refit), five destroyers,
      and two frigates against three powerful U.S. nuclear carrier strike forces deployed
      in the Atlantic, and one in the Mediterranean.33During and after the Cold War,
      NATO’s military planners assumed that rather than attempting a breakout into the
      Atlantic to attack convoys from North America to Europe, the surface ships would
      stay within range of land-based air cover and restrict themselves to holding a
      space from which Russia’s submarine fleet could deploy.34


      There is little doubt that Russia could inflict damage on transatlantic trade
      using submarines in its Northern Fleet. However, even if it is assumed that the
      German and Danish Navies would be occupied in the Baltic and U.S. escort ships
      chiefly deployed to the Far East, Canada and European states on the Atlantic and
      western Mediterranean together possess a vastly greater advantage in numbers than
      was ever possessed by the Allies over Germany’s U-Boat fleet. The Mediterranean
      and the Indian Ocean would remain under full U.S. and NATO control, ensuring continued
      energy supplies.


      While Russia would have limited ability to harm European trade, the United States
      and NATO could certainly use their air and naval superiority to impose a complete
      blockade on Russia’s maritime trade and energy exports by sea. This could include
      the rigorous interception, search, and seizure of neutral merchant ships suspected
      of transporting goods to and from Russia. Since Russia’s only remaining open ports
      would be in the Arctic and Far East, NATO could easily accomplish this. NATO has
      not resorted to such a maritime blockade during the Ukraine War because that could
      lead to direct war with Russia and would also infuriate countries around the world
      that buy energy and food from Russia. However, if Russia had initiated war by
      attacking a NATO country, then a full blockade would be an obvious response to
      reduce the earnings from energy exports that have financed Russia’s war in Ukraine
      and impose enormous costs on the Russian economy and population, far beyond those
      experienced from the sanctions imposed after the Ukraine invasion.


      Russia could not count on decisive victory on land against the tactically and
      strategically disastrous effects of a full-scale air and naval conflict with NATO.
      In this context, it is important to consider the lessons of the Ukraine conflict,
      which has vividly demonstrated that recent developments in military technology
      have conferred huge advantages on the defense. This was manifested in how the
      heavily outmatched Ukrainian forces were able to stop the Russians in the spring
      of 2022, in the defeat of the Ukrainian offensive in 2023, and in the extremely
      slow progress of Russian offensives in Donbas in the winter and spring of 2023
      to 2024. In over two years, Russia has not sustainably advanced more than about
      100 kilometers from its borders, making a Russian conquest of stronger NATO states
      further from its borders appear so unlikely as to be almost fantastical.


      To a degree that took most military analysts by surprise, the utility of massed
      armor for breakthroughs and rapid advances has apparently vanished, and Russia’s
      huge advantage in this regard has been eliminated. As of February 2024, the International
      Institute of Strategic Studies estimated that Russia had lost more than 3,000
      tanks in the Ukraine War, which is equivalent to its entire prewar inventory of
      modern tanks, and was having to recycle old Soviet tanks.35


      The advantage of the defense in Ukraine is related to the facility of precision
      drone and artillery strikes as well as the destructiveness of hand-held infantry
      antitank weapons. But it has also been driven by the extreme difficulty of carrying
      out large-scale surprise attacks and “coups de main” against an enemy with access
      to satellite intelligence. Both before and during the war, the United States informed
      the Ukrainians exactly where the Russians were massing their forces and in what
      strength. In future conflicts, we can expect U.S. satellite intelligence will
      prevent any unexpected or surprise offensives by Russia. Certainly, any Russian
      attack on a large country like Poland would require extensive forces moved to
      Belarus, giving NATO ample opportunity to move its forces east to oppose Russian
      aggression and put into play NATO’s large advantage in total combat troops. The
      United States could contribute to such deployments since U.S. large-scale ground
      forces would likely be unneeded in an Asian contingency.


      As mentioned above, the most attainable scenario for Russia, if it wished to take
      the offensive against a NATO state, would be to rapidly seize one or all of the
      Baltic countries before NATO could reinforce them and face NATO with a fait accompli
      — agreeing to Russian demands or launching a difficult and geographically challenging
      counteroffensive to expel Russian forces.


      Yet even this scenario carries enormous risks and uncertainties for Russia. Massive
      losses in the Ukraine war have badly affected Russian troop strength in the Baltic
      region. According to an analysis from the Foreign Policy Research Institute,36


      “The military threat Russia poses to the Baltic states has reached an all-time
      low point in modern history. Prior to Russia’s renewed invasion of Ukraine, Kaliningrad
      was home to, and defended by, the 11th Army Corps with some 12,000 troops and
      hundreds of armored vehicles, including over 100 T-72 tanks. The corps, thrown
      into Ukraine to fuel Russia’s aggression early in the war, was roughly handled
      over the ensuing months, including a battering during Ukraine’s Kharkiv counteroffensive.
      Whether the formation even survived its trials is questionable and at least would
      need many months to reconstitute itself. By mid-autumn 2022, the overall presence
      of Russian forces along NATO’s (pre-Finnish accession) eastern border had dropped
      from 30,000 to perhaps as low as 6,000.”


      The FPRI analysis concluded it would take the better part of a decade from the
      end of the Ukraine War to rebuild its armed forces to the point it could contemplate
      any attack on a NATO country. The German military assessment is the same.37


      Even if Russia did manage to mount an attack that surged across the borders of
      the Baltic states, the experience in Ukraine indicates that it would be far from
      rapid or simple to take control of urban areas in those nations. During the war
      in Ukraine, heavily outnumbered and outgunned Ukrainian forces were able to hold
      out for months in Mariupol and other cities against vastly superior Russian forces.
      In the first weeks of the war, Ukrainian forces, composed largely of lightly armed
      volunteers, were able to stop the Russian advance through the outer suburbs of
      Kyiv. Thus, even if Baltic and NATO forces were defeated on the frontiers with
      Russia and Belarus, they could fall back on Tallinn (population ca 400,000), Riga
      (population ca 600,000), and Vilnius (540,000). Ukraine’s experience suggests
      that the Balts and the local forces of other NATO states could hold out in these
      cities for a long time and inflict massive casualties on the Russians while awaiting
      NATO reinforcement.


      It is extremely unlikely that a Russian attack on the Baltic states would lead
      other NATO countries to accede to Russian demands as opposed to escalating into
      full-scale war. The sight of NATO cities reduced to rubble and NATO civilians
      slaughtered would make it politically and psychologically near impossible for
      other NATO countries not to come to their aid. In addition, NATO’s Enhanced Forward
      Presence program has stationed “tripwire” forces from large NATO countries in
      the Baltic states and other areas bordering Russia. Casualties among these battle
      groups would make it politically impossible to simply accede to Russian demands.38


      The difficulties of an attack on the Baltic states — by far the militarily weakest
      part of the NATO alliance — would be multiplied exponentially in any assault against
      other NATO states bordering Russia, which have far more powerful militaries and
      present far greater geographic barriers to a Russian invasion.


      Thus, in any objective sense, aggression against NATO states presents a highly
      unattractive prospect to Russia. Such aggression would be unlikely to lead to
      significant territorial gains or cause NATO to back down. Instead, it would likely
      trigger a potentially catastrophic air and naval conflict in which Russia would
      be severely outmatched and likely suffer major strategic losses. Indeed, such
      losses could threaten the survival not only of the Putin regime but also of Russia
      as a geopolitical entity. NATO has enormous deterrent power against Russia, even
      in Russia’s “best case scenario” of aggression against NATO’s weakest border states
      in the Baltics.


      In any objective sense, aggression against NATO states presents a highly unattractive
      prospect to Russia.


      This deterrence is only increasing as Russia continues to suffer losses in Ukraine
      while NATO countries are engaged in an unprecedented arms buildup. Since 2021,
      NATO countries have already increased arms spending by almost 25 percent, and
      further substantial increases are on the horizon as the E.U. plans ambitious growth
      of military expenditures and strengthening of the European military industrial
      base.39While Russia is also attempting to increase its military spending, the
      vastly greater total size of NATO economies indicates that NATO’s arms buildup
      will only increase the size of the gap in military capacities between NATO and
      Russia.


      None of this is to say that Western powers would not incur significant costs in
      a no-holds-barred NATO-Russia conventional conflict. If Russian submarine forces
      could not blockade European trade, they could certainly damage shipping. Extreme
      Russian measures like destroying Western geolocation satellites used for targeting
      could severely damage the civilian economy.40However, the balance of costs and
      benefits would be decisively against Russia in such a scenario.


      Conclusion


      Overall assessment and the nuclear threat


      In combination, the two sections above conclude:


      With no natural land barrier, Russia is motivated by the need to maintain a defensive
      buffer against current and prospective rivals. In the past, such motivations have
      sometimes led to Russian aggression and expansionism to secure a defensive perimeter
      (as indeed may be Russia’s perception of its current aggression in Ukraine). Current
      Russian strategic thinking recognizes its military inferiority to NATO. It seeks
      to deter NATO from attack, secure guarantees against NATO enlargement, and ideally
      move NATO forces back from its immediate borders. An analysis of the relative
      balance of forces between NATO and Russia confirms that Russian conventional military
      capacity is, in fact, far inferior to NATO. Russian conventional aggression against
      NATO countries carries enormous risks, and the NATO deterrent against any direct
      Russian military attack on a NATO state is very strong.


      Thus, Russia is unlikely to initiate a conventional military assault against a
      NATO country. Given the NATO-Russia military imbalance, Russia’s goal of curbing
      NATO’s presence along its borders and in what it considers its sphere of influence
      cannot be accomplished by such aggression.


      The great risk presented by this situation is that, in understanding its conventional
      disadvantages, Russia will rely more heavily on its nuclear forces. As opposed
      to conventional forces, Russia retains full parity with NATO in the field of nuclear
      weapons. As of 2023, Russia was estimated to have 5,889 nuclear warheads (1,549
      deployed) to the U.S., 5,244 (1,419 deployed); the French, 290; and the British,
      225.41Russia has 11 ballistic missile submarines to the U.S. 14; Britain and France
      have four each. These arsenals are enough to destroy the United States, Russia,
      and Europe and end modern civilization worldwide. U.S. and Russian nuclear ballistic
      missiles are both within 30 minutes of their targets in the other country. A limited
      nuclear exchange involving tactical nuclear strikes on ground forces would devastate
      Eastern Europe and Western Russia, although it would spare the U.S. mainland.


      It appears that the U.S. and Russian governments are conscious of the implications
      of nuclear war for both countries. As the U.S. nuclear arms negotiator Rose Gottemoeller
      wrote of Russian nuclear war drills in May 2024,42


      “The Kremlin appears to be reinforcing, in no uncertain terms, a red line against
      NATO boots on the ground in Ukraine. Fortunately, it is a red line that most NATO
      leaders share, including U.S. President Joe Biden … Putin also wants to avoid
      a direct fight between Russia and NATO. For him, that means avoiding strikes against
      NATO territory or reconnaissance aircraft patrolling the airspace over the Black
      Sea. NATO deliveries are fair game for attack once they arrive on Ukrainian soil,
      but not while they are still transiting NATO territory.”


      In other words, Putin has raised the possibility of escalation to nuclear war
      not primarily to bring about Russian victory in Ukraine but to ward off the threat
      of Russian defeat in a direct war with NATO. This aligns with our analysis above,
      which shows that Russia recognizes its substantial inferiority in conventional
      forces and has no desire to initiate a conventional war by attacking NATO.


      But it also underlines the risk created by permitting the current fundamental
      instability in European security arrangements to remain in place. Current trends
      are not heading toward a stable and predictable new dividing line in Europe between
      a dominant NATO alliance and a weak association of Russia with a handful of ambivalent
      partners. Rather, they are on a course toward a renuclearized and volatile hybrid
      confrontation between a West that is less united and self-confident than it appears
      and a Russia that sees its stakes in this confrontation as existential and will,
      therefore, have incentives to exploit and exacerbate internal Western vulnerabilities.
      The two sides have few channels of diplomatic communication through which to manage
      crises, and they have almost no formal and informal rules of the game akin to
      those that helped to keep the Cold War cold. As a result, this unstable division
      in Europe will be constantly prone to new crises in battleground states such as
      Belarus, Georgia, Moldova, Kaliningrad, and elsewhere, any of which could escalate
      into catastrophic consequences.


      In short, the threat of war between Russia and NATO is quite real, but not because
      Russian leaders have any desire to initiate a war of conquest against the West.'
    one_sentence_summary: Western leaders' portrayal of Russia's invasion of Ukraine
      as the beginning of a broader European conquest is misleading, as Russia lacks
      the military capability and intent to aggressively target NATO members, necessitating
      a diplomatic approach alongside military deterrence to mitigate escalating tensions.
    paragraph_summary: Western leaders, including President Biden, often portray Russia's
      invasion of Ukraine as a precursor to a broader campaign against Europe, but a
      detailed analysis suggests this perspective is overly simplistic and potentially
      dangerous. Contrary to the belief that Russia seeks to conquer NATO countries,
      evidence indicates that Russia lacks both the military capability and strategic
      interest to engage in aggression against NATO members. Instead, Russia's actions
      are largely defensive, motivated by a desire to protect its sphere of influence,
      particularly in Ukraine, which it views as integral to its national security and
      cultural identity. Despite its military superiority over individual NATO states,
      Russia is at a significant disadvantage against the NATO alliance as a whole,
      which possesses overwhelming conventional forces. The article argues that while
      military deterrence is necessary, it must be complemented by diplomatic efforts
      to stabilize relations and address underlying tensions, as an overreliance on
      military posturing could exacerbate instability and push Russia to rely more heavily
      on its nuclear arsenal. Ultimately, restoring diplomatic communication is essential
      to mitigate the risks of military escalation and foster long-term strategic stability
      in Europe.

    text: 'Executive Summary Conventional wisdom holds that a negotiated end to the
      Ukraine war is neither possible nor desirable. This belief is false. It is also
      extremely dangerous for Ukraine’s future. The war is not trending toward a stable
      stalemate, but toward Ukraine’s eventual collapse. Russia has corrected many of
      the problems that plagued its forces during the first year of fighting and adopted
      an attrition strategy that is gradually exhausting Ukraine’s forces, draining
      American military stocks, and sapping the West’s political resolve. Sanctions
      have not crippled Russia’s war effort, and the West cannot fix Ukraine’s acute
      manpower problems absent direct intervention in the war. Ukraine’s best hope lies
      in a negotiated settlement that protects its security, minimizes the risks of
      renewed attacks or escalation, and promotes broader stability in Europe and the
      world. Skeptics counter that Russia has no incentive to make meaningful concessions
      in a war it is increasingly winning. But this belief underestimates the gap between
      what Russia can accomplish through its own military efforts and what it needs
      to ensure its broader security and economic prosperity over the longer term. Russia
      can probably achieve some of its war aims by force, including blocking Ukraine’s
      membership in NATO and capturing much of the territory it regards as historically
      and culturally Russian. But Russia cannot conquer, let alone govern, the majority
      of Ukraine, nor can Russia secure itself against the ongoing threats of Ukrainian
      sabotage or potential NATO strikes absent a costly permanent military buildup
      that would undermine its civilian economy. Reducing the deep dependence on China
      created by the invasion will also sooner or later require Russia to seek some
      form of détente with the West. As a result, the United States has significant
      leverage for bringing Russia to the table and forging verifiable agreements to
      end the fighting. But this leverage will diminish over time. The United States
      should therefore quickly challenge Putin to make good on his insistence that Russia
      is willing to negotiate by publicly supporting calls from China, Brazil, and other
      key Global South actors for talks to end the war. And to help build trust and
      bolster dialogue, American officials should reach out to Russian representatives
      through both formal channels and a strictly confidential “back channel” that would
      facilitate sensitive discussions. Given deep Russian doubts about U.S. intentions,
      our outreach will have to include signals that we are prepared to discuss Moscow’s
      concerns about NATO expansion in the context of a Ukraine settlement. Ukraine’s
      best hope lies in a negotiated settlement that protects its security, minimizes
      the risks of renewed attacks or escalation, and promotes broader stability in
      Europe and the world. No settlement will endure unless Ukraine, Russia, and the
      West all see it as sufficiently serving their interests and as preferable to continued
      war. But we need not and should not simply trust that all parties will abide by
      its terms. Moscow and Washington have decades of useful Cold War experience in
      constructing, implementing, and monitoring a wide range of security agreements
      despite mutual distrust and broader geopolitical competition. While formidable,
      the obstacles to success are not insurmountable. By combining defensive aid to
      Ukraine with a vigorous diplomatic offensive, the United States could secure independence
      for the vast bulk of Ukraine, provide a viable path toward its prosperity, and
      mitigate the dangers of long-term confrontation with Russia in Europe. This would
      not constitute a complete victory, but it would still be a monumental achievement.


      Introduction


      Over the course of two years, the war in Ukraine has gone through several major
      cycles of action and reaction. The first took place immediately after Russia’s
      large–scale invasion, when Ukraine quickly stymied Russia’s gambit to storm Kyiv
      and overwhelm Ukrainian defenses with simultaneous attacks from the north, east,
      and south. A series of embarrassing and largely self–inflicted failures forced
      the Russian high command to shift course and refocus efforts on capturing territory
      in Ukraine’s east and south, where the Russians made only modest advances over
      the course of several months. Whatever else happened in the war thereafter, it
      appeared unlikely that Putin’s army would ever raise the Russian flag over Kyiv.


      The war shifted again in the latter part of 2022. Ukraine was receiving more and
      more tranches of precision Western weaponry to pair with the real–time intelligence
      it was gathering with American help. Effective Ukrainian air defenses discouraged
      the Russian air force from flying over Ukrainian territory and exploiting its
      enormous numerical advantages in the skies. Ukrainian commanders identified and
      exploited thinly–manned portions of Russian lines and scored spectacular victories
      in Kherson and Kharkiv. As winter weather forced a pause in the ground campaign,
      Ukraine had clear momentum in the war, and it appeared to many observers that
      the combination of Ukrainian battlefield grit and Western high–technology could
      ultimately force Putin to sue for peace.


      Russia adapted yet again, however. In late 2022, Putin ordered what he called
      a “partial mobilization,” adding more than 300,000 troops to Russia’s depleted
      invasion force and putting Russian factories on a war footing. Meanwhile, Russian
      forces in the Donbas and south dug in, building formidable multi–echeloned defensive
      lines of tank traps, ditches, minefields, and underground shelters. Throughout
      the winter, Russia launched wave after wave of missile and drone strikes on Ukrainian
      energy infrastructure, thereby draining Ukraine of air defense munitions. Putin,
      it appeared, had shifted to an attrition strategy, betting that Russia’s numerical
      advantages in population and military production would eventually exhaust Ukraine’s
      resources and the West’s patience, while minimizing the risks of direct clashes
      with NATO.


      This strategy has largely succeeded. Ukraine’s failed “counteroffensive” in 2023
      and subsequent move to what it calls an “active defense” strategy marked the end
      of its hopes for recapturing large amounts of Russian–occupied territory. Russia
      demonstrated over the course of last year that it had learned from its early mistakes
      on the battlefield, adapted to the challenges posed by Western high technology,
      and advanced its own capabilities in drone warfare and electronic countermeasures.1
      At the war’s two-year mark Russia has clear momentum, and Ukraine has few apparent
      means to regain the battlefield initiative and force Russian capitulation.


      A failure to recognize the realities of this phase of the conflict carries grave
      risks for Ukraine’s future and for U.S. strategic interests. While the battlefield
      situation currently appears to be at a stalemate, the buildup of Russian forces
      in Ukrainian territory carries a risk of sudden military collapse for Ukraine.
      Even if this worst–case scenario does not occur, Ukraine cannot reasonably be
      expected to develop and prosper economically and politically as a “fortress state”
      while it remains at war.


      A failure to recognize the current realities of the conflict carries grave risks
      for Ukraine’s future and for U.S. strategic interests.


      Although a Ukrainian military victory is increasingly out of reach, the United
      States still has important advantages in the wider conflict over securing Ukraine’s
      independence and ensuring stability in Europe — issues that lie at the roots of
      the Russian invasion. Supplementing our military aid to Ukraine with vigorous
      diplomatic engagement with Russia would open up new possibilities and advantages
      for the West. We should test Putin’s repeated statements (for example in his recent
      interview with Tucker Carlson on February 8, 2024) that Russia wants to enter
      into negotiations, and that Moscow can recognize Ukrainian independence as long
      as Ukraine is not actively hostile to Russia.


      This paper addresses why pro–Ukrainian actors must adapt their approach and how
      a new diplomatic strategy can protect the key interests of the United States and
      Ukraine. We examine the limits of what Russia can achieve despite its growing
      battlefield momentum, why Moscow still has some incentives to negotiate despite
      its distrust of American intentions, and what steps American officials could take
      to increase the likelihood of an acceptable end to the war.


      The Military Balance: Time is Not on Ukraine’s Side


      Going into 2023, the belief that Ukraine could reconquer all or most Russian-held
      territory was informed by Ukraine’s remarkable achievements in the months following
      the initial Russian invasion. The magnitude of Ukrainian success in defeating
      the Kremlin’s initial hopes of reducing Ukraine to a Russian client state was
      in fact even greater than generally perceived at the time. If the war were to
      end today, some 80 percent of Ukraine would be independent and at least informally
      aligned with the West. This would reverse more than 300 years of Russian domination
      of Ukraine.2


      But in 2023 Ukrainian battlefield advances stalled. As Figure One shows, the front
      lines of the conflict barely moved during 2023 as the Ukrainian mid-year offensive
      failed. Ukrainian territory held by Russia is almost identical to what it was
      a year ago, at approximately 18 percent of Ukraine’s territory under 1991 borders.


      Ukrainian victories in 2022 were due to multiple factors: appallingly bad Russian
      staff work, intelligence, tactics and logistical preparation; Russian troop numbers
      that were inadequate to the tasks set them; rapid Ukrainian mobilization coupled
      with a flood of enthusiastic volunteers; Western weapons that nullified Russia’s
      vast superiority in armor and aircraft; and U.S. intelligence that informed the
      Ukrainians of the precise location, time and numbers of planned Russian attacks.3


      Of all these factors, only the last two still work in Ukraine’s favor, and only
      if Ukraine remains on the defensive. Other factors have shifted from the start
      of the war:


      Russian staff work and tactics have greatly improved as their military adapted.
      4


      Russia has more than doubled the size of its force on the ground as compared to
      2022.


      Ukraine has taken substantial losses from among the troops initially mobilized.


      Many Russian weapons are more effective defending against attacking forces than
      they are on the offensive.


      Russia has greatly increased its capacity to jam the electronic systems on which
      much of the NATO–supplied weapons rely.


      The Western powers hoped that by increasing their supply of weapons they could
      reinvigorate Ukraine’s offensive capacity in the face of these new factors. But
      in 2023 the large quantities of weapons the United States supplied for the Ukrainian
      counteroffensive did not help Ukraine even to break through the first line of
      Russian defenses. Furthermore, supplies of Western weaponry at this level are
      unlikely to continue. As Liana Fix and Michael Kimmage acknowledge,


      A divided Congress likely has no “mountain of steel,” as U.S. officials have called
      the materiel they gave Ukraine in early 2023, to provide for a renewed counteroffensive
      in 2024, and European countries are falling short in the assistance they have
      promised. In purely military terms, Ukraine’s path to victory is unclear.5


      Liana Fix and Michael Kimmage


      It is all too clear that sufficient quantities of aid are not guaranteed even
      in the medium term, let alone indefinitely.6 The interest of Western publics in
      the conflict is declining.7 EU leaders have admitted in private that they cannot
      substitute for U.S. aid to Ukraine (especially in the military sphere) should
      that aid falter.8


      In the United States, Ukraine has been trapped in Congressional gridlock despite
      warnings of imminent collapse of key military capabilities.9 Even if this gridlock
      is temporarily broken for a new aid package, current difficulties are a grim sign
      for the reliability of future assistance. Among Republicans in Congress, a large
      number share the views of Senator J.D. Vance:


      [O]n the Ukraine question in particular, everybody with a brain in their head
      knows this was always going to end in negotiation. The idea that Ukraine was going
      to throw Russia back to the 1991 border was preposterous; nobody actually believed
      it…So what we’re saying to the president and really to the entire world is you
      need to articulate what the ambition is. What is $61 billion [in additional aid
      to Ukraine] going to accomplish that $100 billion hasn’t?10 Lauren Sforza


      Thus, as the war enters its third year, the combination of Russian structural
      advantages over Ukraine in population and economic size and the political uncertainty
      of continued Western aid to Ukraine is forcing, as it should, a reconsideration
      of the insistence on rejecting negotiations with Russia and holding out for total
      reconquest of Ukraine’s 1991 borders. Western advocates of a continued reliance
      on a purely military strategy have fallen back on two claims. 11


      The first proposes that certain tactical Ukrainian successes can bring strategic
      victory in the war. Thus some senior retired U.S. military officers have argued
      that Ukraine’ success with missile strikes against the Russian Black Sea Fleet
      at Sevastopol (which have apparently forced many of its warships to retreat to
      Novorossiysk) mean that Ukraine could drive Russian forces from Crimea — or force
      a broader Russian capitulation — by long–range bombardment alone. 12


      Ukrainian success against the Black Sea Fleet is indeed significant, insofar as
      it reduces Russia’s ability to blockade Ukraine, as well Russia’s capacity for
      amphibious assault on Ukraine’s Black Sea coast.13 However, when it comes to Ukraine
      actually retaking Crimea or forcing a broader Russian capitulation, even if Kyiv
      were given the vastly greater amounts of Western weaponry and munitions necessary
      to attempt this, the Ukrainian army and navy would still have to carry out a major
      amphibious landing. This is perhaps the most challenging of all military operations,
      and one the Ukrainian military is ill equipped for.


      Moreover, long–range air strikes have rarely had decisive strategic effects in
      war absent significant advances in capturing and holding territory. Equipping
      Ukraine for such a campaign would risk provoking large–scale Russian retaliation,
      as it would almost certainly fuel existing criticism from right–wing Russian nationalists
      that Putin has been too passive in defending Russian red lines.14


      The second approach is to recommend that the United States and NATO accept the
      need for a “long war,” as NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg has said.15
      Particularly fervent advocates of a military solution call for Western countries
      to further militarize their economies in order to sustain massive support for
      Ukraine indefinitely. 16


      It is indeed true that given time, money and political will, the United States
      and NATO could give Ukraine much larger amounts of weaponry and ammunition. Steps
      in this direction are being taken. For example, the Pentagon has awarded $1.5
      billion in contracts to increase production of 155 mm artillery shells, and has
      more than doubled monthly shell production since the beginning of the Ukraine
      war.17 However, it has also said that it needs an additional $3 billion in order
      to achieve the target of 100,000 shells a month by 2025 — a level that still falls
      well short of Russian production. 18


      Moreover, while the West can provide Ukraine with weapons, it cannot provide the
      men to use them. Even as Russia’s forces in Ukraine increase, the Ukrainian military
      is experiencing difficulty maintaining an adequate number of high–quality troops.


      According to Time Magazine, the average age of Ukrainian soldiers is now 43 years
      and rising fast — which is much too old for real combat effectiveness.19 Ukraine
      is facing greater and greater difficulties in recruiting conscripts, with many
      young men now evading service within Ukraine, bribing the authorities to exempt
      them, or fleeing abroad. Ukrainian government attempts to toughen and extend conscription
      laws are meeting strong resistance in society and in the Ukrainian parliament.20
      Indeed, the need for large numbers of additional troops despite the political
      resistance to major increases in conscription appears to be an issue at the heart
      of President Zelensky’s conflict with General Zaluzhny, the recently dismissed
      former commander of Ukraine’s armed forces.21


      Even if conscription was increased, all too many of the highly–motivated young
      men who joined up at the start of the war are now dead or disabled, and the quality
      of those remaining is much less certain.22


      In contrast, Russian troop strength within Ukraine is increasing. As Figure Two
      shows, the number of Russian troops within Ukrainian territory is now well over
      double the size of the initial 2022 invasion force.


      Further, the increasing Russian population advantage over Ukraine is likely to
      permit Russia to maintain or increase its growth in forces, and possibly overwhelm
      Ukrainian manpower resources. Although getting reliable data out of wartime Ukraine
      is a challenge, migration into the EU and into Russia in response to the war appears
      to have driven substantial Ukrainian population declines since the invasion. As
      Figure Three below shows, estimates of the population in Ukrainian–controlled
      territory today run from about one quarter at the high end to less than one fifth
      of Russia’s population.


      While there are doubts about the quality of Russian troops, the sheer size of
      Russian military resources constitutes a structural advantage. As long as the
      Russians maintain substantial superiority in numbers, this gives them some chance
      of an overall strategic breakthrough, as opposed to limited tactical advances.23


      Russia only has to fortify its existing battle line within Ukraine to hold the
      territory it has won. Beyond holding this territory, Russia has the potential
      to resume the invasion of northern Ukraine that it launched (with some initial
      success) at the very start of the war. Even if Belarus is excluded as a potential
      launch pad for a Russian offensive, that still leaves Ukraine with an additional
      possible frontline of some 600 miles to defend. The Ukrainian army has been doing
      its best to fortify the northern border; but where will it find the troops?24


      Hopes that the Russian economy would collapse under sanctions and make continuation
      of the Russian war effort impossible have also not been realized. Russia has also
      been able to raise its spending on the military to six percent of GDP, and more
      than 60 percent of the state budget, while also achieving growth in GDP of 2.2
      percent in 2023. Due to the willingness of most of the world to go on buying Russian
      energy and the collapse of imports from the West, Russia’s current account surplus
      grew to $16.6 billion in the third quarter of 2023.25


      As a result, there is now little realistic prospect of further Ukrainian territorial
      gains on the battlefield, and there is a significant risk that Ukraine might exhaust
      its manpower and munitions and lay itself open to a devastating Russian counterattack.
      Recognizing this, and belatedly accepting the advice of Ukraine’s military chiefs,
      President Volodymyr Zelensky has now given the order that the Ukrainian army should
      stand on the defensive and fortify its existing lines.26


      There is now little realistic prospect of further Ukrainian territorial gains
      on the battlefield.


      As reflected in the shift to the defensive, knowledgeable insiders are admitting
      the core military weaknesses of the Ukrainian position. For example, General Zaluzhny,
      Ukraine’s former military commander during the first two years of the war, wrote
      a recent CNN article which highlighted the same structural issues facing Ukraine
      that we have described above as regards deficiencies in manpower, uncertain allied
      assistance, and Russian economic resilience under sanctions.27


      Although the battle lines have not shifted substantially over the past year, the
      war in Ukraine is not likely to remain a stalemate. A lesson of World War One
      is that stalemates, however prolonged and bloody, do eventually end. In the words
      of Jack Watling regarding the Ukraine conflict:


      When you look at the rates of attrition on both sides and what is being lost and
      consumed, it’s a position that can’t be maintained indefinitely. Stalemate would
      suggest that if we just left things as they were, it would remain the same. That’s
      not the case. It will remain the same for a period, and then you see non-linear
      progression as one side gains advantage or loses it.”28


      This can be partly because of a change in tactics, but above all because in a
      war of attrition, the numbers, munitions and economy of one side falter before
      the other does so, leading to a collapse either of the army or the home front.
      As things stand at present, if either side in the Ukraine War eventually cracks,
      it seems likely to be Ukraine.


      Can Ukraine Thrive While War Continues?


      Proponents of sustaining a “long war” between Ukraine and Russia appear to assume
      not only that Ukraine can sustain its fight on the battlefield but that it can
      survive and even thrive as a society while it remains at war. Many advocates of
      a “long war” approach optimistically portray a “Fortress Ukraine” able to develop
      beyond the poverty and corruption that has long plagued the country, as well as
      join the European Union to share in broader European prosperity, all while Russian
      missiles rain down and bitter battles rage along the eastern border.


      Unfortunately, this optimistic vision is at odds with several aspects of Ukraine’s
      reality. Ukraine is overwhelmingly dependent on Western military and economic
      aid if it is to survive — and it has become obvious that the continuation of this
      aid cannot be guaranteed.29 Figure Four below compares Ukraine’s GDP to flows
      of foreign aid from 2021–23. It is immediately evident that during wartime Ukraine’s
      military and civilian economy has been profoundly dependent on a sustained and
      massive flow of foreign assistance. For example, Ukraine’s predicted budget deficit
      of $43 billion in 2024 (more than a quarter of total GDP) will have to be entirely
      covered by Western aid.30


      However, the practical and political sustainability of this assistance is now
      in doubt. New commitments of aid to Ukraine dropped to almost zero in the last
      four months of 2023. While the EU has recently made a new commitment to a $54
      billion four–year aid package, large additional amounts will still be needed to
      sustain the pace of assistance for 2024 and future years.31 At the time of writing,
      it remains highly unclear just how much more will in fact be forthcoming.32


      Western leaders continue to declare that their countries will continue to support
      Ukraine “for as long as it takes” — though “as long as it takes” to do what exactly
      they do not say, and indeed do not appear to know.33 Most have acknowledged that
      the war will end in negotiations, but they have also not distanced themselves
      from the Ukrainian “peace formula” of complete Russian withdrawal and war crimes
      trials, which in effect makes negotiations with Russia impossible, and implies
      a total Russian defeat that is becoming less and less credible.


      These Western promises of support are pointless if the Ukrainians do not believe
      them, and dangerous if Ukraine does rely on them to seek complete victory in the
      war. In the view of Gwendolyn Sasse:


      The mantra of ‘supporting Ukraine for as long as it takes’…increasingly resembles
      self-reassurance rather than a future-oriented strategy. Moreover, frequent references
      to ‘Ukraine’s victory’ have turned this phrase into a means for politicians to
      position themselves rather than act.34 Sam Meredith


      It is clear that sufficient quantities of aid are not in fact guaranteed even
      in the medium term, let alone indefinitely.35 The interest of Western publics
      in the conflict is declining.36 EU leaders have admitted in private that they
      cannot substitute for U.S. aid to Ukraine (especially in the military sphere)
      should that aid falter, while congressional gridlock threatens Ukraine aid currently
      and seems likely to be an ever increasing factor if the war continues with no
      end in sight.37


      Moreover, if the West is to accept a long war aimed at the complete defeat of
      Russia, then the present debate will have to take place again next year, and the
      year after that, and the year after that. Given how difficult this issue has proved
      recently, can anyone honestly and realistically promise that Western political
      systems will go on and on producing that aid, every year, indefinitely?


      Even in the face of declining prospects for aid, some believe that Ukraine’s long
      term future can be sustained if it wins EU membership and fully enters the Western
      economic, social and cultural sphere. During the cold war, Western Europe was
      able to develop (or rather re–develop, after the destruction of World War Two)
      as the second great center of the world capitalist economy after the United States.
      This in turn fostered stable and successful liberal democracy. The extension of
      prosperity and democracy beyond Western Europe — first to the Mediterranean countries,
      then to the former communist states of eastern Europe — was assisted, in a series
      of stages, by the establishment, strengthening and expansion of the European Union.


      But as long as the war continues it seems highly unlikely that such a prospect
      beckons for Ukraine. It is true that the EU has now agreed to accession talks
      with Ukraine and declared its openness in principle to Ukrainian membership.38
      However, the EU’s assessment of requirements for membership shows that Ukraine
      still falls well short of EU standards in areas ranging from the control of corruption
      to democratic institutions to public financing and economic stability to minority
      rights.39 Addressing these shortfalls will be extraordinarily challenging while
      Ukraine remains in a state of war. Indeed, there are few if any precedents for
      nations joining the EU while in a state of conflict.40


      Ukraine’s poverty is also a barrier to accession. Figure Five compares Ukrainian
      GDP per capita to both the EU average and the poorest EU member (Bulgaria), in
      constant international dollars adjusted for purchasing power parity. As the chart
      shows, even before the war Ukrainian economic production was continuously far
      below the EU average and well under half of that of the EU’s poorest member. The
      war has only expanded this gap, despite a flood of foreign economic and military
      aid.


      Moreover, the Ukrainian state has been traditionally plagued by very high levels
      of corruption.41 In 2021, Transparency International’s corruption index ranked
      Ukraine at 122 out of 180 countries, below Egypt and South Africa. Recent confidential
      U.S. government documents that were leaked to the press show that the corruption
      issue is ongoing and concern about corruption remains high among Ukraine’s allies
      today.42


      The Ukrainian political system is also showing disturbing signs of stress. Politically,
      war has led to a considerable degree of authoritarianism, with the banning of
      political parties, newspapers and TV stations and the imprisonment or exile of
      opposition figures, including some who cannot seriously be accused of sympathy
      for Russia. Culturally, it has led to a tremendous intensification of ethnic nationalism.
      This is understandable given the Russian invasion and the suffering it has caused;
      but it is nonetheless incompatible with core EU principles.43


      Some of these obstacles could perhaps be ignored by a completely and unanimously
      sympathetic EU. However, opinion polls in key nations already show somewhat shaky
      support.44 And recent tension between Ukraine and even highly sympathetic nations
      like Poland over the economic issues involved with assistance to Ukraine demonstrate
      that when concrete economic challenges arise, support can quickly evaporate.45


      Could Ukraine become a successful “fortress state” while still at war, even if
      it experienced substantial delays or difficulties in joining the EU? This too
      seems highly doubtful. Without a peace agreement, Moscow would have every incentive
      to “wreck” Ukraine and block any Ukrainian effort to transform itself into a fortress
      state partnered with the United States or NATO.


      After one year of war, the World Bank estimated that over $400 billion would be
      needed for Ukraine’s economic reconstruction, not including the military costs
      of pursuing a continuing war.46 The figure would no doubt be even higher today.
      But Russia effectively wields a veto over that reconstruction. This massive scale
      of investment is highly unlikely to be sustainable while donors know that Russian
      strikes could destroy any new project at any given time. Building any effective
      nationwide air defense system to protect reconstruction projects would take many
      years and many billions in Western aid, and Russia’s growing pace of missile production
      suggests Moscow could sustain its ability to strike Ukrainian infrastructure for
      years to come.


      Ukraine also faces formidable demographic obstacles to succeeding as a “fortress
      state.” Ukraine’s demographic outlook was discouraging even before the Russian
      invasion, as its pre–independence 1991 population of some 52 million declined
      steadily to 44 million in 2020, due to declines in life expectancy and birth rates
      as well as economic migration to Europe. The outbreak of war has further reduced
      the population actually living in Ukrainian–controlled territory to crisis levels.
      The loss of Crimea in 2014 removed a further 2.5 million inhabitants, and at least
      six million refugees — mostly well–off and well–educated, including a disproportionate
      number of women and children — have fled the country for Europe since that time.
      In addition, Russia claims that some seven million Ukrainians have fled to Russia
      since fighting began in 2014.


      Although getting reliable data out of wartime Ukraine is a challenge, prominent
      Ukrainian demographer Elena Libanova now estimates that there are only 28 million
      persons under Ukrainian control — a drop of almost 40 percent since 2020.47 (See
      Figure Three above). She also estimates that Ukraine’s birthrate has dropped to
      0.7 births per woman, among the lowest in the world. Both a strong military and
      a thriving economy demand a young, healthy, and productive labor force. But that
      slice of Ukraine’s population has been particularly hurt by the war, and so long
      as the war continues, refugees are unlikely to return to Ukraine in large numbers.


      A frequent trope among those who believe that prosperity can be combined with
      ongoing conflict is to use the example of Israel.48 But the Israel model for Ukraine
      can be dismissed by one simple proposition: if Syria were Russia, Israel would
      not be Israel. In other words, if Israel had faced the permanent hostility of
      a neighbor with over 10 times its economy, higher technological capacity, and
      nuclear weapons, it would never have been able to develop as it has done.49


      Prospects for Ukraine’s growth and development as an independent and prosperous
      democracy without a cessation of hostilities with Russia appear grim.


      Ukraine would also require far higher levels of U.S. aid to sustain it than Israel
      ever has. In the 75 years since becoming a state in 1948 until the current Gaza
      War, Israel received more than $260 billion (in 2023 dollars) in U.S. aid. But
      to sustain Ukraine at war, the United States and the EU have had to give the same
      amount during just the first two years of the conflict (see Figure Four above).
      As argued here, to suggest that such massive Western aid can in fact be permanently
      guaranteed is a self–deception.


      In sum, prospects for Ukraine’s growth and development as an independent and prosperous
      democracy without a cessation of hostilities with Russia appear grim, indeed.


      The Promise of Diplomacy


      Given the risks on the battlefield and the unlikelihood of establishing a thriving
      democratic state in Ukraine while it remains under active Russian attack, Washington
      would appear to have few good options for bringing the war to an acceptable end
      while ensuring Ukrainian security.


      Nonetheless, there is much wisdom in the old adage that when a problem appears
      insoluble, expand it. That does not mean expanding the war itself to include other
      states: a Ukrainian victory on the battlefield is almost certainly out of reach
      even with Western intervention, and bringing U.S. or NATO forces directly into
      the fighting could easily escalate into nuclear use and mutual catastrophe. It
      does mean going on the diplomatic offensive, however, exploiting the advantages
      that the West still retains in the greater geopolitical game over Europe’s security
      architecture and Ukraine’s role within it.


      Many reject this possibility out of hand.50 Among the claims made are that Russia
      is not motivated or willing to negotiate, that Putin would never accept an independent
      Ukraine, that any Russian success in the war would encourage aggression elsewhere,
      and that Moscow would not abide by the terms of any acceptable settlement.51


      Some of these claims are dubious, some are exaggerated, and others are testable
      — and can only be tested through negotiations. It is certainly true that any negotiations
      with the Russians would be quite difficult. But those who reject diplomacy as
      a viable option underestimate the gap between what Russia can achieve through
      its own military efforts in Ukraine and what it needs to ensure its broader security
      and economic prosperity over the longer term. They also underestimate the ways
      in which verifiable agreements could be constructed even in areas where trust
      has been undermined by Russian aggression and years of bitter warfare.


      Given the grim alternatives to a negotiated settlement, it is incumbent on U.S.
      policymakers to seriously explore the possibilities. Below, we analyze Russia’s
      incentives for negotiation in light of its own declared goals in the invasion
      of Ukraine, potential mechanisms to bring Russia to the table, and how the requirements
      for a sustainable agreement that both guarantees Ukraine’s security and offers
      Moscow sufficient incentives for compromise might be fulfilled.


      Why would Russia negotiate?


      If Ukraine cannot realistically mount an offensive able to recover Russian–occupied
      territories on the battlefield nor turn itself effectively into a fortress state
      able to hold off Russian advances for years to come, an inevitable question arises:
      Is a negotiating strategy aimed at forging an acceptable settlement with Russia
      a viable option? In other words, does Russia have any incentives to compromise
      in a war of attrition that increasingly is going Moscow’s way?


      The answer to this question pivots on an assessment of Russia’s key aims in the
      war. Public statements by Putin (including his recent interview with Tucker Carlson),
      and other key Russian officials, as well as Russian conduct over the past three
      decades, suggests the following list of objectives.


      “De-NATOization.” Prevent Ukraine’s membership in NATO or de facto military partnership
      with the United States, potentially through a treaty of neutrality


      “Demilitarization.” Prevent post-war Ukraine from posing a military threat to
      Russia, including to Russian-held territory inside Ukraine’s 1991 borders.


      “De-Nazification.” Transform Ukraine into a friendly vassal state, or at a minimum
      prevent it from becoming an anti–Russian, ethno–nationalist state.


      Regather lands in eastern Ukraine that Moscow regards as rightfully Russian both
      historically and culturally.


      Accelerate the transformation of both the European security order and the broader
      international order from unipolar American primacy into a multipolar system in
      which Russia plays a meaningful role.


      Achieve these goals while avoiding direct war with the United States and NATO.


      Russia’s progress in the war to date suggests that it has the ability to achieve
      some — but far from all — of these goals on the battlefield. These include blocking
      a Ukrainian military alliance with the West and recovering at least some of the
      territories in eastern Ukraine that it regards as historically and culturally
      Russian.


      Despite the fact that Russia’s initial military thrust at Kyiv in 2022 was aimed
      at replacing the government of Ukraine with a pliable pro–Russia leadership, it
      is also clear that the Russian military is incapable of conquering — let alone
      governing — the vast bulk of Ukrainian territory by force.52 Conquest of all of
      Ukraine would require building and equipping a military force on a scale many
      multiples that of Russia’s current occupying forces, and far larger than the initial
      invasion force. Given the intense hostility to Russia in Ukraine, which has been
      cemented by years of war, conquest would also require devoting many years if not
      decades to an expensive occupation of decidedly hostile territory. 53


      But as Ukraine’s supplies of men, artillery shells, and air defense munitions
      dwindle, Russia appears increasingly capable of capturing land in Ukraine’s east
      and south that it has officially annexed but does not yet occupy.54 And although
      Moscow cannot compel Washington or Kyiv formally to renounce their goal of Ukrainian
      membership in NATO, it can exercise an effective veto over Ukraine’s membership
      by refusing to end the war absent a binding Western pledge to deny Ukrainian admission
      to the alliance.


      Demilitarization is a goal that Russia can achieve only to a limited degree through
      military efforts alone. One of the reasons Putin and the Russian military command
      settled on an attrition strategy following the failure of their initial bid to
      capture Kyiv was the difficulty in fighting a war of maneuver in the face of Western
      high–technology weaponry and advanced intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance.
      But another was that a slow war of attrition served the broader Russian objectives
      of not only winning the war, but also damaging Ukraine’s ability to reconstitute
      a post–war military.


      As Washington has grown more pessimistic about Ukraine’s ability to drive Russian
      forces off of all occupied land, it has focused increasingly on building Ukraine
      into a fortress state capable of denying a Russian victory for many years to come.55
      As Russian analyst Andrey Sushentsov has argued, the main goal of the United States
      has shifted toward the “preservation of the existing front line and stabilization
      of the situation: Ukraine will retain its mobilization potential and industry
      and will also be ready to continue to fight Russia.” 56


      But it is in Russia’s interests, he says, to oppose this Western ambition and
      “for Ukraine to transform not into a well–armed ‘Israel,’ but into a sort of ‘Bosnia’
      — a divided country, devoid of industrial potential and unable to become a significant
      counterweight to Russia.” Russia can certainly advance that objective on the battlefield.
      The longer the war continues, the greater the toll it is taking on Ukraine’s population,
      industry, and infrastructure. Ukraine is already struggling to muster the manpower
      needed to man an army; operate and maintain its equipment; and work in the factories
      needed to support it.57 Russian barrages of artillery, rockets, drones, bombs,
      and missiles can ensure that those challenges continue, if not grow, over time,
      particularly as Western supplies of air defense missiles diminish.58


      Still, demilitarization through military efforts alone is a more expensive and
      more uncertain path to neutering Ukraine’s military potential than reaching a
      deal with Ukraine and the West on arms control measures would be, at least in
      principle. Russia could potentially occupy lands it has annexed but does not yet
      militarily control, but even after success in seizing them, Russia would be left
      with the problem of securing them against future attacks and reconstructing them
      in the face of probable sabotage attempts by Ukraine and sanctions from the West.
      Putin has appeared to recognize this problem by calling for the establishment
      of a “demilitarized zone” — an implicit contrast to the broader goal of a fully
      demilitarized Ukraine — that would keep Ukrainian artillery and missile forces
      at a safe distance from Russia and Russian–held territory.59


      Just like the Soviet desire for Western recognition of post–World War Two borders
      in Eastern Europe drove Moscow’s positions during Helsinki negotiations in the
      1970s, the Kremlin therefore has reasons to want at least de facto Western acquiescence
      to Russian control of Crimea and the Donbass. The alternative will mean a much
      higher level of Russian expense in fortifying those regions, and a much lower
      level of success in reconstructing them.


      Moreover, although Russia can erode Ukraine’s military manpower and cripple its
      infrastructure, it cannot prevent the West from supplying Ukraine with some form
      of long–range strike capability absent an agreement with Washington and NATO.
      Ukraine’s military potential is only one aspect of a broader security problem
      for Russia — its vulnerability to strikes from NATO territory — that the war in
      Ukraine has exacerbated. This vulnerability will remain a significant danger absent
      arms control and confidence–and security–building measures (CSBMs) similar to
      those that helped keep the Cold War cold.


      The war has in fact greatly damaged Russia’s ability to pursue peaceful security–building
      measures or play any meaningful role inside a new European security order.60 Instead,
      it has set Europe on a course toward long–term division and confrontation between
      Russia and NATO, while making diplomatic discussions about managing the dangers
      of such confrontation nearly impossible. Russia, in other words, has shown that
      it can block the further expansion of NATO into ex–Soviet republics, but it cannot
      fight its way into Western recognition that Russia has a legitimate role to play
      in Europe’s security order, nor can it reduce the potential for direct war with
      NATO absent diplomatic engagement with the United States and Europe. In sum, although
      Russia can make progress on demilitarizing Ukraine, it still has some significant
      reasons to want an understanding with the West over Ukraine and the broader European
      security order.61 Absent such an understanding, Russia faces a significantly more
      dangerous and fraught future.


      Although Russia can make progress on demilitarizing Ukraine, it still has some
      significant reasons to want an understanding with the West over Ukraine and the
      broader European security order.


      Regarding “denazification,” which Russian officials have not clearly defined,
      Russia’s invasion has been enormously counterproductive, accelerating Ukraine’s
      transformation into an anti–Russian, ethno-nationalist state that is likely to
      remain hostile toward Moscow for at least a generation to come, regardless of
      how the war unfolds from this point.62 But Russian ambiguity about this objective
      provides it with some degree of flexibility in claiming it has been achieved.
      It is certainly possible, for example, that growing unhappiness over the war could
      result in Zelensky’s removal from office, either electorally or otherwise, which
      the Kremlin could portray as fulfillment of its demand for “de–Nazification.”
      Indeed, signs of friction between Zelensky and other Ukrainian elites have grown
      clear.63 But it is also possible that a successor leadership could be equally
      or more anti–Russian than the Zelensky government has been.


      Russia’s best hopes for a less ethno–nationalist and anti–Russian leadership in
      Ukraine would lie in two scenarios. In the first, the start of a formal EU accession
      process would incentivize Ukraine to rein in ethno–national extremists as it attempts
      to align with EU membership requirements. In the second, Ukraine would follow
      a path similar to Georgia after the 2008 war with Russia, with pragmatic leaders
      gradually coming to power who recognize that deepening commercial relations with
      Russia — while also seeking robust trade to Europe — is a path toward securing
      both their own fortunes and greater national prosperity.64 Nonetheless, both scenarios
      (which are not mutually exclusive) would be almost unimaginable absent an agreement
      among Ukraine, Russia, and the West to end the war.


      Apart from specific war aims, Russia has other reasons to want a bargain with
      the West. The degree to which Russia is barred from meaningful discourse with
      the United States and Europe deepens its dependence on China and circumscribes
      the role it can play in a multipolar world order.65 So long as Western sanctions
      remain in place, Russia will have little to no commercial involvement in European
      markets and no seat in European councils overseeing security matters, nor will
      individual Russians enjoy the benefits of travel to European destinations. For
      a state that has for centuries looked to the West culturally and bridged East
      and West politically, Russia’s presently narrow geopolitical options must be to
      some degree discomfiting.


      Getting Russia to the table


      States typically seek negotiated ends to war when they doubt continued fighting
      will advance their goals and fear it might damage them. As they see the correlation
      of forces tilting toward Russia over time, Ukraine and the West are at the early
      stages of drawing such conclusions.66 By contrast, Russia has no compelling short–run
      need to compromise with Ukraine and the West anytime soon, as it has reasons at
      present to believe continued fighting will improve its position.67 However, as
      discussed above, Russia has long–term security interests that could be advanced
      more effectively through a negotiated settlement than by continual warfare and
      complete exclusion from the European security order. Under such circumstances,
      how might the United States draw Russia into a diplomatic process that preserves
      Ukraine’s independence, provides it with acceptable security, and mitigates the
      dangers of confrontation between Russia and the West in Europe?


      The obstacles to such an endeavor are formidable. Levels of trust between Russia
      and the West are at rock bottom. Years of bloodshed have stoked intense mutual
      hatred between many Ukrainians and Russians, and Vladimir Putin has become politically
      radioactive in both the United States and Europe. Powerful political voices in
      Russia, Ukraine, and the West denounce calls for diplomacy and press those in
      power to double down on demonstrations of military strength.68 Meanwhile, the
      window for mutual compromise is narrowing, as the possibility that Ukraine might
      collapse under Russia’s military and economic pressure grows and the danger the
      United States will prove politically incapable of sustaining high levels of assistance
      mounts.


      The first (though not necessarily the biggest) challenge will be to bring Russia
      to the negotiating table. A key prerequisite for negotiations will be continued
      Western assistance to Ukraine, without which Ukraine might collapse and Russia’s
      incentives to compromise would diminish. However, such assistance should be designed
      to create incentives for negotiation, rather than aimed at driving Russian forces
      off Ukrainian territory, which as discussed earlier in this paper is now all but
      impossible. Assistance which sustains Ukraine’s ability to defend itself by blocking
      or impeding Russian advances and to contend with Russia airstrikes will be critical
      to persuading Moscow that compromise would be a less costly and more effective
      path to achieving its goals than continued fighting.


      A key prerequisite for negotiations will be continued Western assistance to Ukraine,
      without which Ukraine might collapse and Russia’s incentives to compromise would
      diminish.


      A second prerequisite will be re–invigorating direct communication between Washington
      and Moscow. Neither state’s ambassador has been withdrawn, but neither has significant
      interaction with the host government; one of the ways Washington can signal its
      interest in diplomatic engagement with Russia is to reach out to Russia’s ambassador
      to talk while indicating that we are prepared to discuss the full range of issues
      in our bilateral relationship in the context of progress toward a settlement in
      Ukraine. Washington should supplement this step by seeking a strictly confidential
      channel of discussions between envoys with the respective trust of the White House
      and Kremlin. Such a “back channel” was critical to the successful resolution of
      the Cuban missile crisis, and it would help assure Russian skeptics that Washington
      is serious about finding terms of a settlement that would be acceptable to Ukraine,
      the United States, and Moscow.


      Such steps might begin to address Moscow’s not altogether unreasonable concern
      that Ukraine and the West might intend to use negotiations merely to buy time
      for rearmament and enable a future Ukrainian offensive in the war — a fear that
      is parallel to the same concern about Russia expressed by Western critics of diplomacy.69
      Francois Hollande’s and Angela Merkel’s admission last year that the French–German
      sponsorship of the “Minsk 2” plan for settling the war in the Donbass in 2015
      was in fact a cover for Ukraine to build its military capabilities has attracted
      considerable attention in Russia, deepening doubts that the West would bargain
      in good faith.70 The combination of such distrust with Moscow’s likely belief
      that it can advance many of its war aims unilaterally means that Russia is unlikely
      to agree to a mutual ceasefire as a first step toward a settlement. To underscore
      its seriousness about diplomacy, Washington will likely have to indicate that
      it is prepared to discuss the issue of NATO membership for Ukraine in the context
      of a broader agreement on ending the war and managing broader threats to European
      security.


      Indicating to Moscow that we might consider accepting Ukraine’s military neutrality
      would go some distance toward convincing the Kremlin that we intend to do more
      than play for time in negotiations. It would also signal that we recognize the
      war is about more than territory and other bilateral disputes between Russia and
      Ukraine and includes broader issues about Europe’s security architecture that
      cannot be addressed absent direct U.S. involvement.


      Given Putin’s other war objectives, however, it cannot be guaranteed that this
      move alone would bring the Russians to the table. To do that, we will probably
      need to enlist the help of two sets of players on whom Moscow is increasingly
      dependent: the Global South and China. Neither of these actors could or would
      attempt to coerce Russia into ending the war by aligning with efforts, such as
      the proposed Ukrainian “peace formula,” which are effectively ultimatums that
      do not allow for any accommodation of Russian negotiating positions.71 Indeed,
      they have mixed feelings about the Russian invasion: few want to see either a
      clear Russian defeat or Western triumph in the war, having sympathy both for Ukraine’s
      plight and for the Kremlin’s complaints about American stewardship of the world
      order.


      Both players, however, could help bring pressure on Russia to demonstrate that
      it is willing to seek a reasonable settlement in Ukraine. Key players in the Global
      South, including Brazil and South Africa, have launched tentative efforts to promote
      negotiations.72 These players could provide the United States with a means of
      escaping from the diplomatic cul-de-sac that its categorical opposition to compromise
      with Russia over the European security order has created. In meetings with various
      Global South diplomats urging a settlement of the war, Putin has repeatedly insisted
      that Russia is open to negotiations and blamed Ukraine and the West for refusing
      talks. Ukraine’s formal ban on negotiations with Russia, coupled with the Biden
      administration’s slogan that it will discuss “nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine,”
      has enabled such rhetoric.73 Should Washington endorse calls from the Global South
      for talks, it would in effect call Russia’s bluff, pressing Putin to demonstrate
      his alleged openness.


      It might also ease an acute political problem in Ukraine. Were Zelensky independently
      to call for negotiations, he would open himself to potentially destabilizing attacks
      from Ukraine’s political right wing, which strongly opposed his efforts early
      after his election in 2019 to find a compromise with Russia and end the war in
      the Donbass. It is highly improbable that Zelensky or any Ukrainian president
      could survive initiating talks with Russia absent public pressure from Washington
      on which to pin blame.


      Deepened American engagement with China over settling the war in Ukraine could
      also constrict Putin’s room for diplomatic maneuver over the war. Beijing has
      already called for a settlement and appointed a special peace envoy.74 While China
      is no doubt pleased that assistance to Ukraine has drained American stockpiles
      of weapons that might otherwise be available for defense of Taiwan, continued
      fighting will only incentivize expanded military production in the United States
      and Europe. At this stage, Beijing is almost certainly concerned that perceptions
      of its sympathy for Russia in the war could jeopardize its economic relations
      with Europe and prompt greater European involvement in Asian security affairs.75
      Beijing’s admonitions to Russia about nuclear use over Ukraine also suggest that
      it worries about prospects for escalation into direct clashes between Russia and
      the West, with potentially severe consequences for China.


      Thus, while it is true that its broader strategic partnership with Russia means
      that China is unlikely to press Russia for a unilateral ceasefire or withdrawal
      from Ukraine, it nonetheless has strong reasons to want a negotiated peace in
      the war that addresses key Russian security concerns while preserving Ukrainian
      independence and sovereignty.


      Because Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has greatly increased its economic and geo–strategic
      dependence on Beijing, Moscow would be unlikely to object publicly to Chinese
      talks with the West over settling the war.76 Yet any prospect that China might
      do so would be concerning for the Kremlin, just as Ukraine has been wary of possible
      U.S.–Russian negotiations without Ukrainian participation. The combination of
      growing U.S. flexibility with deepening Chinese involvement might be sufficient
      to bring Putin to the negotiating table.


      At the table


      The question of who should sit at the negotiating table is critical. As noted
      earlier, any bilateral negotiation between Russia and Ukraine would almost certainly
      fail. Should Zelensky seek such talks on his own initiative, he would run a grave
      risk that domestic political opponents would push him from power. For its part,
      Russia is convinced that the United States, not Ukraine, is the key to any durable
      settlement. Ukrainian representatives are in no position to negotiate over the
      broader contours of Europe’s security architecture, which the Kremlin regards
      as the central issue of the war, and which pivots on the policies of the United
      States and its influence over NATO allies.


      Similarly, any attempt to reach a U.S.–Russian bargain and impose it on Ukraine
      would also fail. Several issues in the war — such as territory and the treatment
      of ethnic and cultural Russians living in Ukraine — are bilateral matters between
      Moscow and Kyiv that do not involve the United States (though minority rights
      will be an issue for the EU in negotiations on Ukrainian membership). Just as
      Ukraine could not ensure American compliance with any deals it tried to forge
      with Moscow over broader European security matters, Washington could not guarantee
      Kyiv’s support for any bargain with Russia that it might attempt to strike over
      Ukrainian territory.


      These realities suggest the need for a negotiating framework with variable geometry.
      Some aspects of the war will require direct Ukrainian–Russian negotiations, including
      on such matters as delineating and protecting borders (which will almost certainly
      take years if not decades to officially work out, and may — as in Cyprus — have
      to be shelved indefinitely). Others will require trilateral or multilateral discussions,
      such as negotiating limitations on Ukrainian military holdings, American and Western
      military involvement in Ukraine, and Russian military deployments in occupied
      Ukrainian territory and the adjacent region. Still other aspects, such as economic
      reconstruction and providing security assurances to Ukraine, will require broader
      international involvement.77


      The organization of such talks could parallel the “baskets” approach taken by
      the Helsinki talks in the 1980s, with participation in each basket varying.78
      A security basket would address arms control, confidence– and security–building
      measures (CSBMs), demining, and other military matters. An economic basket would
      handle such issues as economic reconstruction, sanctions relief, and war reparations.
      A human dimension basket could discuss prisoners of war, war crimes, ethnic minorities,
      and other related matters.


      79


      Contours of a compromise


      To be effective and enduring, any settlement must address key concerns of Ukraine,
      Russia, and the West.


      For Ukraine, this means reliable assurances that it will not be vulnerable to
      another Russian invasion and has a viable path to reconstruction and economic
      prosperity.


      For Russia, this means reliable assurances that Ukraine will not be an ally of
      the United States or host NATO weapons or forces.


      For the United States and Europe, this means reliable assurances that Moscow will
      not parlay military success in Ukraine into broader threats to Russia’s neighbors
      or to NATO member states.


      Given the difficulty of negotiations, it is impossible to predict in advance the
      details of a settlement. However, contrary to the claims of those who reject diplomacy,
      a settlement that addresses all of these concerns is possible in principle. In
      fact, Ukraine and Russia moved some distance toward such a compromise under Turkish
      and Israeli mediation in March and April 2022, when the two sides outlined a draft
      agreement that traded Ukrainian neutrality for multilateral security guarantees
      and began to zero in on limits for Ukrainian military holdings, prior to Ukraine’s
      renouncing negotiations with Russia and betting that it could drive back Russian
      forces from occupied territories.80


      Given Russia’s growing military advantages since that time, Moscow would almost
      certainly drive a harder bargain today, particularly as it relates to caps on
      Ukrainian military holdings. But the fundamental bargain — Ukrainian neutrality
      and a multilateral arms control regime in return for Ukrainian independence and
      a path toward economic prosperity — remains the most promising means of addressing
      all sides’ key interests and incentivizing mutual compliance with terms of a settlement.


      Although Ukraine’s position in the war is eroding over time, both Ukraine and
      the West still retain leverage in attempting to advance their interests.81 The
      threat of deeper American military involvement in Ukraine — either by intervening
      more directly in the fighting or by providing more advanced weapons to Kyiv —
      is something that Moscow clearly wants to preclude. Making clear to the Kremlin
      that Washington might have no alternative to such involvement absent a settlement
      would serve as a powerful incentive for Russian compromise. In parallel, the prospect
      of gradually easing Western sanctions in return for progress in forging and implementing
      a settlement would add a sweetener for a deal.


      Both Ukraine and the West still retain leverage in attempting to advance their
      interests.


      The biggest incentive for Russian compromise would be geopolitical: the prospect
      of gradually regaining a recognized diplomatic role in European security affairs
      that would reduce its dependence on China and provide greater geostrategic autonomy
      in dealing with both West and East.82 In this regard, provisions for securing
      Ukraine’s neutrality may offer a creative way to allow Russia to earn its way
      into the halls of European diplomacy. With U.S. and perhaps Chinese involvement,
      negotiators could build upon Ukraine’s 2022 proposal for establishing an international
      group of guarantors that would include the permanent members of the UN Security
      Council, as well as such states as Germany, Italy, Poland, and Turkey.83 These
      states could eventually expand their functional cooperation in securing and guaranteeing
      Ukraine’s neutrality into addressing broader issues in European security affairs
      and provide a path for translating Russian compliance with a Ukraine settlement
      into restoring Russia–West dialogue more generally.


      Russia’s good faith implementation of a settlement in Ukraine could allow those
      guarantors to evolve over time into a formal body, smaller and more functional
      than the consensus–based, 57–member Organization for Security and Cooperation
      in Europe. Europe has long lacked an operational forum similar to the Concert
      of Europe in which key powers could find pragmatic ways to balance competing interests
      and prevent brewing crises. The prospect of involvement in such a body could serve
      as a significant incentive for Moscow to strike a compromise over Ukraine’s independence
      and pursue a broader détente with the West.


      Russia would certainly demand some form of cap or limitation on Ukraine’s military
      holdings and the weaponry stationed in the country. This aligns with Russia’s
      “demilitarization” goal in Ukraine and its perceived vital security interests.
      Such caps would require U.S. involvement as well.84 To preserve Ukraine’s security,
      any caps on Ukrainian military resources should be paired with complementary ceilings
      on Russian military forces that are geographically positioned to threaten Ukraine.


      The goal should be to establish mutually applicable ceilings on both Russian and
      Ukrainian weapons inside defined geographic zones, coupled with transparency,
      notification, and inspection requirements. This could be modeled loosely on the
      approach taken in the now defunct Adapted CFE Treaty. Crucially, in this treaty
      Russia agreed to limitations on weaponry that Russia could station on its own
      territory in the North Caucasus and near Ukraine. Kyiv’s strongest leverage in
      such negotiations will be U.S. involvement and willingness to help rebuild and
      modernize Ukraine’s military — which would provide a strong backstop if Russia
      did not agree to verifiable limitations on its own forces.85 Further, as was demonstrated
      in the lead–up to the 2022 invasion, U.S. satellite technology and surveillance
      capability would provide powerful methods of rapidly verifying Russian compliance
      with an agreement around the positioning of its own military forces.86


      The question of Ukraine’s territorial delineation is a particularly thorny problem,
      and one that is highly unlikely to be resolved through official compromise. It
      is also not an appropriate matter for non–Ukrainian countries to determine unilaterally.
      The failure of Ukraine’s counteroffensive in 2023 to break through Russian defenses
      and recapture Russian–occupied territory means that Ukraine will almost certainly
      not be capable of recovering all the land under its 1991 borders, and Russia will
      be loath to surrender at the negotiating table land that it regards as Russian
      for which it has sacrificed considerable blood and treasure.87 The best one might
      hope for would be to establish a settlement process in which agreeing on borders
      is not a prerequisite for ending the fighting, similar to the wars in Cyprus and
      the Korean peninsula. Ukraine’s 2022 proposal in fact envisioned such an approach,
      positing a 15–year consultation period on the status of Crimea that would come
      into force only after a complete ceasefire.88


      Finally, there is the frequently expressed concern among some Western commenters
      that any negotiated peace would somehow embolden Russia to engage in further aggression
      toward neighboring countries.89 The chances that Russia might parlay some kind
      of victory in Ukraine into new invasions in Europe are in fact quite low. In Ukraine,
      Russia has had a formidable challenge conquering territory on its immediate border,
      on terrain it knows well, with the benefit of short supply lines and years of
      intelligence preparation. It is difficult to imagine that Russia could successfully
      invade a NATO state, for which NATO would very likely have advance intelligence
      warning and would almost certainly invoke an Article V defense. It would also
      involve much longer supply lines and much less favorable conditions. Nor are there
      any signs that Russians desire such a war. In fact, Russia has gone to great lengths
      to avoid direct clashes with NATO in its invasion of Ukraine.


      Conclusion – U.S. Policy Steps


      The discussion above gives a sense of specific policy steps the United States
      could take to pave the way toward the negotiating table. These steps include:


      Restoring defensive aid to Ukraine: It is important to lift the question of aid
      to Ukraine out of its current political morass and establish that the United States
      will aid Ukraine’s self-defense unless and until Russia comes to the negotiating
      table. However, aid should not be targeted at goals that are militarily impractical
      and signal hostility to any negotiated settlement, such as the complete defeat
      of Russia. The alignment of the intent, level, and type of aid with the goal of
      a negotiated solution should reduce political opposition to aid, which is currently
      driven in part by the fear of an endless war and unlimited costs. Open a confidential
      diplomatic back channel to Russia: Washington should seek mutually trusted envoys
      from the United States and Russian side who could begin private communication
      around the possibility of negotiations. Privately indicate that the United States
      is open to discussing NATO membership for Ukraine: As discussed above, this would
      be a powerful signal to Russia of Western seriousness in seeking peace. It would
      also carry little if any practical cost given that the reality of Western actions
      show that the United States and other NATO members do not wish to involve their
      own forces in a Ukraine conflict. Reach out to China and the Global South to discuss
      the parameters of a negotiated compromise in Ukraine: Such outreach would also
      be private, but could have a powerful effect in demonstrating our seriousness
      to Russia in seeking a settlement. Change U.S. public rhetoric: Our public rhetoric
      should indicate openness to negotiations rather than the belief that peace can
      be obtained purely by ultimatum or coercion, or that conflict should be sustained
      indefinitely.


      Even if the United States embarks seriously on an effort to create a path to negotiations,
      the process of compromise will not be easy or simple. But the alternatives — for
      Ukraine and the world — will be far worse.'
    one_sentence_summary: The article argues that a negotiated settlement to the Ukraine
      war is both possible and necessary for Ukraine's future, as the current military
      situation favors Russia and risks Ukraine's collapse, emphasizing the need for
      the U.S. to leverage its influence to facilitate talks that ensure Ukraine's security
      and stability in Europe.
    paragraph_summary: The article argues that the prevailing belief that a negotiated
      end to the Ukraine war is impossible is misguided and poses a significant risk
      to Ukraine's future. It contends that the war is not stabilizing but rather trending
      toward Ukraine's potential collapse, as Russia has adapted its military strategy
      and is gradually exhausting Ukrainian forces and Western political resolve. Despite
      the challenges, including a dwindling supply of Western military aid and Ukraine's
      acute manpower issues, the article suggests that a negotiated settlement could
      protect Ukraine's security and foster broader stability. It emphasizes that Russia,
      despite its current military advantages, cannot achieve all its objectives through
      force alone and may have incentives to negotiate. The U.S. is urged to leverage
      its influence to facilitate dialogue, balancing military support for Ukraine with
      diplomatic efforts to engage Russia in negotiations that could lead to a sustainable
      resolution of the conflict.

    url: https://quincyinst.org/research/the-future-of-european-security/
    text: 'Executive Summary In three online sessions in May, the Quincy Institute convened
      a working group of leading experts on European foreign and security policies to
      discuss the stance of European countries concerning the war in Ukraine, “de-risking”
      the relationship with China, and the chances of an autonomous European approach
      to these issues. The group also discussed the much longer-term possibility of
      a new security architecture in Eurasia including Russia and China. The meetings
      of the working group took place under Chatham House rules, whereby participants
      are not individually cited. The following report therefore reflects a consensus
      of the group, but not necessarily the views of each individual member. Members
      of the working group were generally in agreement that as long as present circumstances
      continue, European countries are expected to take little independent action in
      the security domain, either individually or collectively. Genuine moves towards
      military self–sufficiency remain inhibited by resistance to pooling resources,
      and the fact that it is much cheaper simply to rely on the United States for defense.
      In addition, Washington has never brought really heavy pressure on the Europeans
      to provide for their own security, because the U.S. establishment and military–industrial
      complex see great advantages in keeping them in a position of dependence, even
      if this is extremely costly for U.S. taxpayers.1 Consequently, the European countries
      (which in this case really means France and Germany) are highly unlikely to adopt
      a determined autonomous initiative for a ceasefire in Ukraine. On the other hand,
      opinion was divided on how far European countries will be willing to follow the
      United States towards the economic and military containment of China, at least
      if this seems to involve them in serious losses and dangers. It was also pointed
      out that present circumstances will not last forever, and may not even last for
      very long. Several possible occurrences could change European attitudes. These
      include developments on the battlefield in Ukraine; a shift in Sino-U.S. relations
      towards actual conflict; a new global economic crisis; or a drastic acceleration
      of the effects of climate change. Given these potential developments, the group
      concluded that the United States should refrain from putting excessive pressure
      on Europe in areas where this could cause both severe economic damage and a backlash
      in European public opinion. This means, in the first instance, putting pressure
      on Germany to break off important economic links to China. In future, however,
      it could also mean U.S. refusal to support a ceasefire in Ukraine even if a majority
      of European states and populations desired one. U.S. policymakers should remember
      that the war in Ukraine is taking place in Europe, not North America and that
      the United States has a vital interest in maintaining Europe’s prosperity and
      democracy. The United States must not endanger them in the pursuit of its own
      narrow and short–term geopolitical goals. Finally, the group agreed that international
      affairs experts must not allow themselves to become trapped by contemporary issues
      and assumptions, because they might prove (as has often been the case) to be relatively
      temporary and contingent. Precisely because the situation today is so dire, it
      is important both to examine the past to see how we got to where we are, and to
      think imaginatively and independently about ideas for a better international system
      for our descendants.


      Introduction


      The Russian invasion of Ukraine has caused a reconsolidation of the transatlantic
      alliance behind American leadership. Previously inconceivable steps have taken
      place (especially on the part of Germany), including the supply of heavy weaponry
      to Ukraine.


      Nevertheless, the potential remains for serious future divergences. Thus it should
      not be ignored how far European willingness to follow the U.S. lead has been enabled
      by the presence of a Democratic and Atlanticist administration in Washington,
      and European delight at the replacement of President Donald Trump. Future U.S.
      elections could therefore lead to a shift in sentiment in some leading European
      countries — though on the other hand, a continuation of the swing of European
      electorates to far right positions (as has already occurred in Italy and elsewhere)
      could reconsolidate the transatlantic relationship on a new basis. How far and
      in what ways this would change policies towards Russia and China is however at
      present a matter of pure speculation.


      Three issues in particular risk creating tensions both between the United States
      and Europe and among Europeans, thereby weakening the Western alliance. U.S. policymakers
      need to think seriously about European concerns when formulating policy in these
      areas:


      • The goals of Western support for Ukraine: Hardline elements in the United States,
      Britain, and Eastern Europe support the stated goal of the Ukrainian government
      to see Russia completely defeated and driven from all the territory it has taken
      since 2014, including Crimea.2 They hope this will lead to the overthrow of the
      Putin regime and the permanent weakening or even disintegration of the Russian
      Federation.3 Certain European leaders, including President Macron of France, by
      contrast, have stressed the need for a negotiated peace, and have said that Russia
      should, in the long run, be given a place in European security.4 At present, these
      differences are not active and public, but they will become so if a ceasefire
      in Ukraine becomes a real possibility, or if the Republican candidate wins the
      2024 U.S. presidential election and decides to reduce U.S. support to Ukraine.


      • Expansion of the European Union: Russia’s full–scale invasion of Ukraine has
      greatly increased support for Ukraine’s early admission to the European Union.
      This dovetails with the desire of the United States and eastern Europe to gain
      early EU membership for Albania, Montenegro, Northern Macedonia, Moldova, and
      Georgia. There are, however, grave concerns in western Europe that these countries
      are very far from qualifying for EU membership, and that fast–tracking them would
      mean in effect tearing up the acquis communautaire as it now stands. Should Ukraine
      be given a free pass in this way it will form a stark contrast with the refusal
      to make any such concessions to Turkey in the accession process; this will undoubtedly
      raise hostile comments in Turkey and throughout the Muslim world.


      These issues could lead to deep divisions in Europe; and if early expansion to
      these countries took place, their subsequent internal problems could radically
      weaken the EU as an institution and community, thereby also damaging vital U.S.
      interests in a strong and cohesive Europe.


      • U.S. pressure to isolate and undermine China economically: Rhetorically, NATO
      has followed the U.S. lead in labeling China a threat, and some European members
      have made minor and symbolic naval deployments in the Indian Ocean and Far East.
      However, France has pushed back strongly against the plan to establish a NATO
      office in Japan and role in East Asia, and U.S. demands that European countries
      join the United States in isolating China economically are meeting widespread
      resistance in Europe.5


      There is, therefore, a risk of a European backlash against U.S. pressure in this
      area. A more restrained policy allowing room for Europe to continue to cooperate
      economically with China and mediate on some issues between Washington and Beijing
      would be strongly opposed by some elements in Washington, but might better serve
      U.S. interests.


      Europe and the war in Ukraine


      Concerning the interests of European countries with reference to the war, the
      group made two initial points: that these interests differ considerably from country
      to country; and that there may be a difference between interests as perceived
      by present governments and the real long–term interests of the countries concerned.
      There is also an underlying divergence between how most Europeans and many members
      of the U.S. establishment see the war. For Europeans, it is a purely European
      conflict. For Washington, it is part of a wider competition with Russia and China
      to maintain U.S. global primacy.


      There is an underlying divergence between how most Europeans and many members
      of the U.S. establishment see the war.


      Poland and the Baltic states, in particular, see their interest as maintaining
      the strongest possible U.S. security commitment to Europe; blocking any moves
      to European strategic and military autonomy; and binding western European countries
      (above all France and Germany) firmly into a permanent anti–Russian alliance.
      They are interested in the Mediterranean issues that concern France, Italy, and
      Spain only insofar as they are related to preventing refugees and migrants from
      entering their countries.


      French presidents, including most lately President Macron, have long aspired to
      autonomy, but have backed away from any real action under pressure from Washington
      and domestic political opposition. Any French moves in this direction are also
      impossible without strong support from Germany.6


      The German political classes and media are now implacably anti–Russian as a result
      of the invasion of Ukraine, and as a result extremely deferential to Washington
      (though this could change depending on the ideological character and policies
      of future U.S. administrations). As one participant remarked, “the tradition of
      postwar German pacifism vanished in a matter of weeks” — though the way had long
      been prepared by the departure from the political scene both of those who remembered
      World War II and those who had taken part in the protests against the Vietnam
      War in the 1960s.7


      Instead, for the younger generation, the Russian invasion of Ukraine is likely
      to be the defining moment of their lives as far as international affairs are concerned.
      Moreover, President Macron is widely regarded in Germany as a lame duck who cannot
      be relied upon — though the group also remarked that this might be a mistake,
      given that he still has four years of his presidency, and “in politics, four years
      is an eternity.”


      No single European government is currently willing to call for a ceasefire, and
      any future independent European initiative for a ceasefire is highly unlikely
      if this goes against the wishes of Washington. But European states are likely
      to hedge, especially when it comes to demands for greatly increased weapons supplies.
      Such resistance is likely to increase if the promised Ukrainian offensive fails
      and a prolonged stalemate appears probable.


      Any future independent European initiative for a ceasefire is highly unlikely
      if this goes against the wishes of Washington.


      Much attention was naturally paid to the question of whether existing levels of
      European aid to Ukraine can and will be sustained. The consensus was that the
      United States will remain responsible for the great majority of military aid,
      and that present levels of economic aid from Europe are sustainable for a considerable
      time to come, given the attitudes of most European populations and political elites
      to the war.


      The group did remark that certain new developments could change this picture.
      One possibility in the short to medium term is a European energy crisis in the
      winter of 2023–24, given that European reserves are exhausted. This could also
      increase tension over prices the United States charges for its energy supplies.
      An energy crisis could also be precipitated by a military conflict over Iran’s
      nuclear program.


      Another obvious development with the potential to cause change would be the victory
      of a Republican candidate in next year’s U.S. presidential elections, with a program
      of decreasing attention to Europe to concentrate on the threat from China. This
      could have multiple effects: reduction in U.S. help to Ukraine and demands that
      Europe should increase aid to compensate; possible pressure for a ceasefire in
      Ukraine; and a renewal of the gulf in political culture between western Europe
      and the United States, which widened during the Trump administration but has closed
      again under Biden. This could lead to increased European resistance to U.S. demands
      concerning China, even as those demands became greater and more insistent. On
      the other hand, it could perhaps encourage France and Germany to seek an end to
      the Ukraine conflict, with the encouragement of the new U.S. administration.


      In the somewhat longer term, as some participants noted, it is possible to envisage
      the shattering effects on existing European policies and attitudes should a war
      occur between the United States and China, leading to a global economic crisis.
      In the longer term, to judge by already observable patterns in western Africa
      and elsewhere, climate change may combine with population growth, poverty and
      ethno–religious conflict to bring about the collapse of major states, vastly increasing
      the numbers of migrants heading to Europe and eclipsing Russia in the eyes of
      Europeans (possibly including even nationalist Poles, to judge by their ferociously
      anti–immigrant attitudes) as the greatest threat to their nations.8 Already, the
      flow of migrants into Europe has been a factor in producing political changes
      that would have seemed inconceivable a generation ago, with several European governments
      having introduced or considered immigration control measures that were once considered
      incompatible with liberal democracy.9 The group also noted that although Brexit
      has turned out very badly for the United Kingdom, it is also a warning of how
      the EU can be threatened by the rise of populism.


      European military spending and strategic autonomy


      Where a serious European discussion about the basis for strategic autonomy is
      taking place is on the issue of increased military spending. Most participants,
      however, expressed considerable skepticism as to how many of the commitments made
      will actually be fulfilled. This is especially true given that European countries
      are experiencing economic stagnation as an aging population places increased demands
      on health and social welfare services, creating tensions with promises of new
      military spending


      It was pointed out that although British, French and German military spending
      put together vastly exceeds that of Russia, its effectiveness is likely to remain
      severely hampered by a refusal to pool and coordinate military production, because
      every major country is determined to defend its own military industrial base.
      This domestic imperative has increased still further as other high–tech industries
      have declined.10


      The wider decline of European industry also has knock–on effects for military
      production. Britain is among the most bellicose of NATO’s European members, but
      its army and navy are both in a parlous state in terms of equipment and numbers.
      Germany has promised huge increases, but very little of the promised money has
      yet been allocated.11


      In part this is because parts of German military equipment are virtually obsolete
      and in need of upgrade. Following 9/11, the German military was pressured by successive
      U.S. administrations to invest in equipment for overseas interventions and counter–insurgency
      operations in support of the “global war on terror” and “humanitarian interventions,”
      at the expense of homeland defense.


      The huge recent increases in U.S. military spending are an added disincentive
      to European countries to spend more on their own defense.


      It was also pointed out that while every U.S. administration and Congress have
      for many years complained about European military incapacity, in many ways this
      situation suits America very well: it ensures geopolitical dependency on the United
      States; and it leads many European countries to purchase American weaponry. The
      huge recent increases in U.S. military spending are an added disincentive to European
      countries to spend more on their own defense.


      It was suggested that the issue of European spending on conventional armaments
      is in certain respects rather academic from the point of view of real security,
      because Russia is clearly unable to launch successful conventional attacks on
      NATO.12 On the European side, high levels of military spending and bellicose rhetoric
      are not at all the same thing as an actual European willingness to fight in Ukraine
      (let alone against China).13


      Attention was drawn to the extremely limited contributions of other European countries
      to the French–led but supposedly joint anti–terrorist campaign in the Sahel, where
      troops actually do have to fight, and the mostly pitiful European military role
      in Afghanistan.14 For historical reasons, Germany does not even have a military
      general staff, which means that theoretically, operational decisions are made
      not in Berlin but by NATO in Brussels — though that does not mean Germany will
      obey orders from NATO if it means going to war with China, for example.


      It is not just that the majority of Europe’s armed forces have been revealed as
      extremely weak, but outside parts of Eastern Europe there is no real will to strengthen
      them.


      This pattern of subservience to the United States has a history stretching back
      to World War II; it has intensified by the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the
      European response. For “if the Ukraine war has revealed a weak Russia, it has
      also revealed a weak Europe.” It is not just that the majority of Europe’s armed
      forces have been revealed as extremely weak, but outside parts of Eastern Europe
      there is no real will to strengthen them. Thus Germany has promised huge increases
      in military spending but so far has only implemented a fraction of them. European
      elites are also highly skeptical of their ability to act in concert without U.S.
      leadership. Europe’s failures in the former Yugoslavia in the early 1990s continue
      to cast a long shadow.


      The European Union as a whole is in any case barred from any pursuit of strategic
      autonomy by the implacable opposition of Poland and the Baltic states. They are
      well aware that their hopes of a crippled or destroyed Russia can only be achieved
      with full U.S. support. France alone is too weak to pursue an autonomous strategy
      either towards China or to peace in Ukraine. These could only be achieved by France
      and Germany acting together, but the will to do this does not exist in the German
      political elites at present.


      Defeat and partition in World War II followed by 76 years of geopolitical and
      military subordination to the United States have created very deep inhibitions
      in the German elites against taking potentially dangerous independent action in
      international affairs. The only partial exceptions, as in the Ostpolitik of Willy
      Brandt’s government after 1969, and Helmut Kohl’s drive for German reunification
      after 1989, have been in the context of relations among German states themselves.
      It was also argued that in the area of foreign and security policy, many purportedly
      independent German think tanks and research institutions are so thoroughly integrated
      (psychologically and in terms of funding and personnel) with transatlantic structures
      as to be “virtually branches of NATO.” This could change, but to bring about such
      a change would take immense shocks to the German system.


      Further expansion of the European Union


      The group agreed that, despite public promises by European leaders and the likelihood
      of considerable future pressure from Washington, expansion of the EU will be slow
      and difficult; in the case of some candidates, it could be impossible. Any major
      change, including the admission of new members, requires the agreement of all
      27 members. The process of change is always very long and complicated, requires
      winning over opponents with concessions, and does not always work.


      In the case of Ukraine, it was felt that continued fighting will be an insuperable
      obstacle to membership, if only because it will make it impossible to start on
      economic reconstruction. On the other hand, if a stable and enduring ceasefire
      can be reached (as in Cyprus), this could allow the start of the accession process.15


      However, the extreme difficulty of this process, and the potential shallowness
      of real support for Ukrainian membership within the EU, has been demonstrated
      by the reaction of Poland (ostensibly Ukraine’s biggest supporter within the EU)
      to Ukrainian grain exports, after strong protests from Polish (and Hungarian)
      farmers that they were losing their domestic and EU markets. Despite a declaration
      from the EU Commission that this action was illegal, Poland banned Ukrainian grain
      imports, and only lifted the ban after the EU agreed that they could not be sold
      on domestic markets.16 Admitting Ukraine would require profound reforms to the
      Common Agricultural Policy, which would inevitably meet bitter opposition from
      farmers in western Europe — especially in France. Hence in part President Macron’s
      attempt to create a “European Political Community,” making Ukraine part of a European
      space but without full access to EU markets and benefits.17


      Ukrainian membership is also likely to face considerable opposition (if only covert)
      from Italy and Spain, which fear that it would radically reduce EU aid to their
      own impoverished regions, and also shift EU attention decisively from the Mediterranean,
      where increasing numbers of migrants and refugees threaten the internal political
      stability of these countries. It was remarked that until this year, the EU’s lack
      of economic help to Tunisia over the past decade was striking, both because that
      country’s decline is exacerbating the migrant crisis, and because for some years
      Tunisia was the only democratic success of the Arab Spring.


      The difficulty of Ukraine’s admission to full membership led to President Macron’s
      initiative for a European Political Community, as a form of half–way house for
      Ukraine and other states. This has been met with intense suspicion in eastern
      European countries, where people fear being relegated to a form of EU outer circle.
      However, it was stated that under the surface, discussions on this possibility
      are also taking place in Poland, given the problems that full Ukrainian admission
      would create for Poland.


      Further enlargement would decisively shift the balance of power within the EU
      eastwards, strengthening ethnic nationalism at the expense of the EU’s foundational
      mission of overcoming nationalism. This would fundamentally change a key part
      of the original mission of the European Union, which has been precisely to combat
      ethnic nationalism. While countries are seeking admission, the EU has considerable
      ability — at least on paper — to shape their institutions and public political
      and social culture. But once they are members, this leverage disappears.


      Further enlargement would decisively shift the balance of power within the EU
      eastwards, strengthening ethnic nationalism at the expense of the EU’s foundational
      mission of overcoming nationalism.


      Several eastern European EU members continue to experience serious problems with
      corruption, which is likely to be an even bigger problem in the case of Ukraine.
      Meanwhile, radical populist movements are also growing in the old “core” EU (though
      they usually moderate elements of their original chauvinism as they get closer
      to government). The future political face of the EU is therefore highly uncertain.


      In terms of security policy, the group feels that the EU is not in a position
      to seek autonomy. As one participant noted, “Whenever I encountered the debate
      on the need for strategic autonomy in Brussels, there was always complete intellectual
      agreement, coupled with complete unwillingness to do anything practical to advance
      this.”


      Washingtons has always acted openly or covertly to block such moves and to make
      sure that all European security plans and actions are channeled through the existing
      NATO command architecture, controlled by the United States More recently, this
      has been reinforced by the determination of east European governments to oppose
      anything that might reduce U.S. military engagement in Europe. This U.S. opposition
      is motivated by a desire to maintain military hegemony in Europe, and by the desire
      of the U.S. military–industrial complex to prevent a European pooling of military
      resources so that countries remain dependent on U.S. weapons exports, technological
      expertise, and military staffwork. Despite repeated promises, European governments
      have made only very inadequate steps towards pooling weapons development and procurement.
      The latest sign of this difficulty has been the clash between France and Germany
      over Berlin’s decision to adopt and promote the Sky Shield system for European
      air defense. Sky Shield is chiefly dependent on U.S. and Israeli technology, to
      the exclusion of the Franco–Italian SAMP–T missile defense system.18


      It was agreed that there is no possibility whatsoever of European strategic autonomy
      without close cooperation between France and Germany. However, there is a stark
      asymmetry between the two in terms of both military power and diplomatic influence.
      France has its own nuclear deterrent, while Germany depends on that of the United
      States. France would like Germany to help pay for France’s nuclear forces, but
      French public opinion is very hesitant about sharing actual control of them with
      Berlin. Following Brexit, France is now the only EU member country with a permanent
      seat on the U.N. Security Council. There have been repeated German suggestions
      that France might wish to share this with the EU, but these have fallen on deaf
      ears in Paris.


      There is no possibility whatsoever of European strategic autonomy without close
      cooperation between France and Germany.


      This being so, the group agreed there was little chance of the EU being able to
      take responsibility for intervening on its own even in any future Balkans conflict.
      Strong U.S. military participation would be essential — and not necessarily forthcoming
      — to prevent a repetition of the disasters and humiliation of the early 1990s.
      Little hope was advanced that a solution could be found to the ethnic disputes
      in Bosnia and between Serbia and Kosovo. Moreover, European countries are themselves
      divided on the subject of Kosovo. Five EU members, led by Spain, refuse to recognize
      Kosovo’s independence, fearing this would set a wider precedent for ethnic separatism.
      With the exception of Montenegro, this is also likely to frustrate further EU
      expansion in the western Balkans.19


      Nor does there seem any prospect of the EU (or NATO) taking responsibility for
      security in the southern Caucasus, even if this were desirable (which, in the
      view of most participants, it is not). Not only would this require the deployment
      of serious numbers of Western peacekeepers in the face of strong Russian and Iranian
      opposition, but U.S. hostility to Russia and Iran, together with the need for
      Azerbaijani energy supplies and the influence of Turkey, are in direct conflict
      with the strong influence of the Armenian diaspora on French policy.20


      The EU, NATO and China: De–risking versus decoupling


      The consensus of the group was that under both Democratic and Republican administrations,
      a U.S. strategy of limiting Chinese access to key technologies will continue and
      intensify, and that the Europeans will gradually fall into line with most of this
      approach, albeit often reluctantly and with long hesitations.21 The Biden administration’s
      industrial strategy and electoral strategy for 2024 are both integrally connected
      to a long–term strategy of winning global economic competition with China, and
      this is likely to continue under a Republican administration.


      In the words of one participant, “The Biden administration has adopted the European
      language of “de-risking” rather than “de-coupling,” but that is just to help get
      the Europeans on side. It doesn’t mean that they will actually listen to them.”
      The Biden administration’s approach to putting pressure on the Europeans is more
      diplomatic and restrained than Trump’s; as a result it is more effective, because
      it does not demand that the Europeans engage in what a British diplomat (during
      the Bush administration of 2000–04) described as “ostentatious demonstrations
      of submission” to Washington.


      However, as the example of the orchestrated reaction to President Macron’s remarks
      on the need for an autonomous EU policy towards China demonstrated, the Biden
      administration is just as determined that Europe should follow America’s lead.
      The effectiveness of this approach was also shown by the way that the Netherlands
      bowed to U.S. pressure to end its supply of semiconductors to China, but in such
      a way that this surrender never appeared in public. Similarly, Germany has moved
      towards increasingly strict limits on Huawei.22


      Opinion polls in many European countries show deep public resistance to being
      drawn into U.S. hostility to China. Among the political elites however — especially
      in Germany, the most important player — there is a sentiment of complete dependence
      on the United States in general and the Biden administration in particular (though
      it was noted that “if the European elites all agree so strongly that this is in
      their interest, it might be a good reason for Americans to ask themselves if it
      is really in our interest.”)


      Opinion polls in many European countries show deep public resistance to being
      drawn into U.S. hostility to China.


      So deep is this attachment that the German elites have not even begun to think
      seriously about preparing hedging strategies should Donald Trump win the 2024
      U.S. presidential election. “They are just praying this doesn’t happen.” A Trump
      presidency could potentially transform U.S. policy towards Ukraine; it would also
      increase the hostility of European liberals to Washington.


      Participants differed somewhat on the degree of economic damage to Europe that
      will be caused by reductions in trade with China. Some raised the German public’s
      fear of de-industrialization. Others said that serious pain will be confined to
      particular industries, notably automobiles and chemicals.23 Although these (and
      the associated trades unions) are politically powerful, they represent a limited
      part of the German economy.


      Moreover, their leaders are aware that Chinese economic strategy and development
      is likely in any case greatly to reduce German exports in these fields over the
      next generation. Germany will resist, but “Germany fought for almost six years
      against U.S. demands to break with Huawei’s 5-G, but eventually surrendered. This
      will happen in other areas too.”


      Could Europe be led to pursue an autonomous and more friendly policy towards China
      if Beijing plays an important part in seeking peace in Ukraine (and is allowed
      to do so by Washington)? Here the opinions of participants differed. Some felt
      that China does have a number of strong motives to end the war. Others felt that
      China is happy enough with the conflict in its present form, and also lacks any
      real experience of such mediation (détente between Iran and Saudi Arabia notwithstanding).


      However, this could change if the war escalates radically. If China cannot itself
      bring about peace, it could play a useful role as an interlocutor with Moscow,
      if the United States becomes committed to the search for an early ceasefire. This
      could improve China’s image in Europe — though doubtless Atlanticist forces would
      also accuse Beijing of having acted not for peace but only to help Russia.


      Future security architecture in Eurasia


      The group agreed that it will be impossible even to hold any public discussion
      on this as long as the fighting in Ukraine continues and Putin remains in power.
      It is also extremely difficult to envisage the development of such a new architecture
      given the intense levels of distrust between Russia and the West and between the
      United States and China.


      However, “history is a long business.” We were reminded that the West European
      Coal and Steel Community of 1951 that laid the foundations of the European Union,
      and of which the key members were France and West Germany, came only six years
      after these countries were engaged in their third war in a century, and would
      have been unimaginable for previous generations of Frenchmen and Germans. Admittedly,
      this only followed appalling catastrophes, culminating in the defeat of both France
      and Germany in World War II, and the occupation, partition and extensive demilitarization
      of Germany. The group fears that if we fail to limit climate change, the future
      could hold global catastrophes on the same scale, leading to equally radical transformations
      of the international order.


      In the near term, it was stated, due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, “All
      the arrows point toward increased confrontation and a much more militarized dividing
      line between the West and Russia. This will also mean more insecurity in Europe,
      and no long–term solution to any of Eurasia’s security dilemmas.”


      However, it is still possible and necessary to think about radical alternatives
      to this grim picture. Moreover, the group recalled that in the past four decades
      alone we have seen a number of unpredicted developments that greatly changed international
      affairs: the collapse of Communism, the Soviet bloc and the Soviet Union; the
      return of China as a superpower; 9/11 and the war on terror; the Russian invasion
      of Ukraine.


      It is highly probable that we will see more such developments in the decades to
      come. Indeed, some are what Donald Rumsfeld might have called “known unknowns”
      — i.e., threats that we can see clearly, but the dimensions and results of which
      we cannot know in advance. In the short term, attention was drawn to the quite
      extraordinary degree to which Europeans are turning a blind eye to the possibility
      that Trump, or another Republican unsympathetic to Ukraine and to Europe, could
      win next year’s U.S. presidential election. Not only could this change U.S. policy
      toward the war in Ukraine, but it would increase European hostility to the United
      States.


      In the longer term, predictable global threats include climate change and its
      impacts on fragile states and societies in the Global South and the potential
      for a radical deterioration in Sino–U.S. relations, with the possibility of disastrous
      war. Such developments could radically transform present European attitudes to
      security and the international order. Given this range of dangers, “we need to
      look at how to build an international architecture that is resilient to multiple
      potential problems.”24


      In the meantime, it is urgently necessary to find ways of managing confrontation
      with Russia and China in order to limit the chances of direct conflict. Participants
      agreed that we need to look to the example of Nixon and Kissinger in the 1970s,
      who combined continued armed rivalry with the Soviet Union with measures to reduce
      tension, build confidence and limit nuclear arms. This included something that
      will be difficult to recreate given the dissolution of the Iron Curtain and the
      entry of the West into what Russia regards as the sphere of its vital interests:
      namely an understanding of borders, and a mutual recognition of other countries’
      red lines — something that to date the Biden administration has explicitly rejected
      (except in the case of U.S. red lines).


      In the words of one participant, “We need to bring order and predictability into
      what will be a confrontational relationship for a long time to come. And we need
      to acknowledge honestly that this will require addressing principles that are
      sometimes in tension with one another: territorial integrity and international
      law versus peace and international cooperation” — in the case of Ukraine, as in
      that of Serbia, strict regard for territorial integrity as opposed to peace based
      on territorial compromise.


      Excluding and isolating a country of China’s economic power and state tradition
      is impossible and a recipe for disaster.


      It was agreed that any reasonably stable international architecture will have
      to include China and perhaps, in the future, India. Excluding and isolating a
      country of China’s economic power and state tradition is impossible and a recipe
      for disaster. Even in Europe, in the future, “if China wants to be involved, it
      will be.”


      This led to the perception that “if a problem looks hard to solve, enlarge it.”
      China can play a critical role in the search for peace in Ukraine and this in
      turn could help lay the foundation for the reduction of tension and the resumption
      of cooperative relations between the United States and China. Moreover, if China
      is to play such a role in Ukraine, not only in bringing about peace but preventing
      future conflict and investing in reconstruction, then this will imply — much as
      Washington will dislike this — recognizing a permanent Chinese stake in European
      security.


      But then, as was pointed out, giving all major actors a stake in a security order
      is critical to that order’s success. Over the past generation, NATO and the EU
      — without admitting this to their own publics — set out, in effect, to eliminate
      Russia’s role in European security, and thus Russia’s stake in maintaining European
      peace and stability. This eventually contributed greatly to the Russian invasion
      of Ukraine. In any debate about future security architecture, it will be necessary
      to keep this disastrous lesson firmly in mind.


      In the longer term, a radical shift in perception regarding the chief dangers
      to their countries, and a sense that the alleged threats from Russia and China
      were secondary or even irrelevant by comparison, could change attitudes in Europe
      toward strategic autonomy.


      If the United States were to move toward actual war with China, even a limited
      one, this would also deeply alarm the Europeans, and perhaps produce an element
      of distancing. Without this or similarly drastic developments in the areas of
      climate change and migration, most participants felt that it is unlikely that
      even a general swing of European politics towards right–wing populist nationalism
      would greatly strengthen European moves to strategic autonomy and a new approach
      to world order.


      In the longer term, a radical shift in perception regarding the chief dangers
      to their countries, and a sense that the alleged threats from Russia and China
      were secondary or even irrelevant by comparison, could change attitudes in Europe
      toward strategic autonomy. This shift could come about as the result of some combination
      of four factors, all of which are already clearly present but whose future dimensions
      are unclear: climate change; mass migration to Europe from the Global South; socio–economic
      decline; and greatly increased ethno–religious conflict within Europe. An additional
      wild card could be a crisis involving the escape of Artificial Intelligence from
      human control.


      Developments in some of these areas will likely take place over not decades but
      generations. However, while we cannot say for sure what radical changes the future
      will bring, we can be absolutely certain (pace Fukuyama) that they will come.
      No human configuration — whether geopolitical, ideological, cultural or economic
      — lasts forever. It is therefore the duty of independent thinkers with a sense
      of history and historical contingency to engage in serious thinking about alternative
      ways of ordering the world, so that policymakers and publics have new ideas on
      hand when new circumstances demand them. The working group’s conversation was
      a serious effort in this direction.


      Conclusions and recommendations


      The overall consensus of the working group concerning U.S. policy was that American
      policymakers should remember that the United States has two fundamental and permanent
      vital interests in Europe, which are not the same as the perceived present needs
      to resist Russia in Ukraine or to contain China in Asia.


      The first vital interest (as it has been for more than a century) is to prevent
      any actual or potentially hostile great power from dominating the great economic
      metropolis of western and central Europe, and establishing a military presence
      on the eastern littoral of the Atlantic Ocean, facing the United States. For the
      foreseeable future, however, there is no danger of this. Russia is not only economically
      weak and getting weaker, but has demonstrated in Ukraine that its military is
      simply not capable of subjugating all of Ukraine, let alone Europe.


      The second vital U.S. interest is to maintain the economic prosperity and democratic
      stability of western and central Europe. This region is a vital economic partner
      of the United States, without which the entire U.S. global economic position would
      be weakened. Equally important, the survival of liberal democracy in Europe is
      vital to its continued survival in the world as a whole, and therefore to America’s
      own global soft power.


      The United States should not block any European initiatives for peace in Ukraine,
      but the present or a future U.S. administration should also resist the temptation
      to try to push responsibility for this onto the Europeans, so as to avoid domestic
      political criticism in America. Full U.S. participation and commitment will be
      essential to any peace agreement.


      The United States should not press, as some U.S. policymakers are tempted to do,
      for accelerated EU expansion to include Ukraine, Georgia and more Balkans countries.
      This would risk paralyzing the EU as an effective economic bloc and crippling
      its essential role in maintaining the global prestige and attraction of liberal
      democratic governance.


      The survival of the EU as an effective economic and political institution is a
      vital U.S. national interest.


      On that score, as noted above, U.S. policymakers should always keep in mind that
      the survival of the EU as an effective economic and political institution is a
      vital U.S. national interest, because it both maintains stability in a key part
      of the world and underpins the “soft power” of Western liberal democracy. This
      should not be sacrificed by Washington for short–term U.S. tactical advantage
      in competition with Russia and China.


      The United States should not try to link the promise of EU expansion to the search
      for a “solution” to the conflicts and disputes in the western Balkans and the
      Caucasus. No such solutions are available at present. In the case of Bosnia and
      Kosovo, the EU might, however, play an essential role in managing disputes and
      preventing them from breaking out again into armed conflict.


      The United States should proceed with caution and moderation in pressuring Europe
      to take a harder line against China. The shift from “decoupling” to “derisking”
      in U.S. language is positive, but needs to be maintained in practice. Washington
      needs to remember that European publics are much less anxious about China than
      about Russia. Measures that could be seen as seriously damaging European industry
      risk causing a public backlash, especially in Germany. As to European military
      deployments against China, these will in any case be purely symbolic. They risk
      angering the Chinese without materially strengthening the U.S.–led presence in
      Asia.


      The United States should proceed with caution and moderation in pressuring Europe
      to take a harder line against China.


      Analysts of international affairs should begin thinking seriously about the future
      shape of a consensual and stable security order in Eurasia. Even if such an order
      seems impossible not just at present but for a long time to come, it is extremely
      important that we should start to draw up ideas for it, so as to be ready when
      the international scene changes radically — as sooner or later, it inevitably
      will.

      was that European nations, particularly France and Germany, are unlikely to take
      independent security actions due to their reliance on U.S. defense support and
      internal divisions regarding the war in Ukraine and relations with China. The
      group noted that while European military spending is increasing, actual effectiveness
      is hindered by a lack of resource pooling and coordination. Additionally, tensions
      may arise from differing views on U.S. policy towards Ukraine and China, especially
      if future U.S. administrations shift focus. The discussions underscored the importance
      of considering long-term consequences and the need for a more nuanced approach
      to European autonomy in security matters, as well as the potential for future
      crises to reshape these dynamics.

  - title: 'Paths to a Ceasefire in Ukraine: America Must Take the Lead'
    url: https://quincyinst.org/research/paths-to-a-ceasefire-in-ukraine-america-must-take-the-lead/
    text: 'Executive Summary Barring an improbable complete victory for Ukraine or Russia,
      the conflict in Ukraine will end, or more likely be suspended, in the form of
      a compromise. The fighting is therefore now essentially about the geographical
      and political lines along which this compromise will be drawn. These will become
      much clearer once the results of the forthcoming Ukrainian counter–offensive are
      known, and the aftermath of the offensive will be the time for an intensive diplomatic
      effort to bring about a ceasefire. Ideally, this compromise should take the form
      of a peace settlement like Northern Ireland’s in 1999, that would end the war
      and allow the creation of a stable, consensual and peaceful security order in
      Europe. More likely, however, is a ceasefire that (as in the cases of Kashmir,
      Korea, and Cyprus) will freeze the existing battle–line, wherever that runs. Such
      a ceasefire will in any case be necessary if talks aimed at a formal peace settlement
      are to take place; and even if such a treaty cannot be reached, such a ceasefire,
      if far from ideal, might still prove reasonably stable and permanent. Both the
      U.S. and Ukrainian administrations stated after it began that the war would inevitably
      end in a negotiated peace. In the first month of the war President Volodymyr Zelensky
      put forward peace proposals that included suspending the issues of Crimea and
      the eastern Donbas for future negotiation. Since then, however, both Ukraine and
      Russia have adopted positions that make any agreement between them exceptionally
      difficult. Given these circumstances, the United States must play the greatest
      role in achieving a ceasefire. The Biden administration should therefore: • Immediately
      commence preliminary talks with other major states on the need for a co–ordinated
      international effort to seek a ceasefire in the autumn or winter, whatever the
      outcome of the next round of fighting. • Be prepared to enlist China as mediator,
      as Beijing has significant influence with Moscow. Key Global South states such
      as Brazil and India should also be consulted. • Draw up provisional and alternative
      plans for a ceasefire to be discussed with other actors. • Begin discussions with
      the United Nations Secretariat on the potential deployment of U.N. peacekeepers
      to Ukraine. • Continue military and financial support to Ukraine for the duration
      of this year, while also telling Kyiv that future U.S. and European assistance
      on this scale is not guaranteed. • Change its public discourse to emphasize the
      extent of the victory that Ukraine (with Western aid) has already won.


      Introduction


      Serious thinking by the Biden administration on the path to a ceasefire and peace
      talks should begin immediately, as should the extension of “back channel” diplomatic
      feelers to all the relevant parties. A full–scale effort can only begin when the
      results of the forthcoming Ukrainian offensive are known, by the winter of 2023–24.
      On the other hand, whatever these results prove to be, a diplomatic initiative
      by Washington will be urgently required. As Rajan Menon has written, “This much
      should be evident: no party will get everything it wants unless it wins an outright
      victory — and that is not in the cards.”1


      The public rhetoric of President Zelensky’s administration has nailed it to the
      position that the return of all the territory lost by Ukraine since 2014 is essential
      and non–negotiable, which implies that the only acceptable outcome is total Ukrainian
      military victory.2 This — like Russia’s insistence that its “annexation” of territories
      occupied last year is non-negotiable – rules out a formal peace settlement for
      the foreseeable future. However, as numerous cases in modern history demonstrate,
      an unwillingness to sign a peace treaty is not an insuperable bar to a ceasefire,
      if military and political realities suggest this.3


      Some leading members of the Ukrainian government believe that the reconquest of
      Crimea is not necessarily possible; but it will take a serious diplomatic effort
      by Washington to allow them to escape from the corner into which their government
      has talked itself.4 Russia, too, will only trust an agreement that is brokered
      by Washington and to which the United States is committed. This does not mean
      that the United States should act alone. On the contrary, the Biden administration
      should reach out to China for help in mediating an agreement.5 Additionally, major
      Global South states, such as Brazil and India, can also be consulted for ideas
      that help lead to a solution. Ukraine and Russia’s agreement to a ceasefire is
      obviously essential.


      A strong U.S. commitment will be central to a peace process and a stable outcome.
      The alternative to such a U.S. diplomatic effort would be a tacit acceptance by
      Washington that this war will go on indefinitely — which would be a thoroughly
      bad prospect for the world, the United States, Europe, and, above all, to Ukraine
      itself.

      As Zachary Paikin has written for the Quincy Institute:


      If Ukraine cannot retake all its territory by force, perhaps victory for Ukraine
      should be viewed not in territorial terms, but rather with respect to whether
      it can survive as a sovereign and viable state, capable of charting a path toward
      a “European” future. Although not a perfect parallel given the different geopolitical
      situation across Europe at the time, Finland retained its sovereignty after World
      War Two and became a prosperous democracy well–positioned to join the EU, despite
      having been forced to cede territory to the USSR.6


      Different military scenarios


      All three possible results of the Ukrainian offensive point to the need for a
      ceasefire.7


      A Ukrainian breakthrough


      If the Ukrainian military succeeds in breaking through to the Sea of Azov, cutting
      the Russian position in two, and isolating Crimea, then — as Biden administration
      officials have indeed suggested — on the one hand, Ukraine will be in a very strong
      position to call for a provisional agreement whereby Russia would leave all the
      territory it has occupied since last year’s invasion (most of which it would have
      lost already), while the status of Crimea and the Donbas would be left for future
      negotiation. Of course, Russia might escalate towards nuclear war in these circumstances
      — but this would be much less likely if continued de facto Russian control of
      Crimea and the eastern Donbas were guaranteed.


      If Ukraine, emboldened by its success, were to attempt to reconquer Crimea, this
      could lead Russia to engage in a drastic escalation: not immediately to the use
      of nuclear weapons, but on a path that would point in that direction.


      On the other hand, if at this point Ukraine, emboldened by its success, were to
      attempt to reconquer Crimea, then — as some U.S. officials also fear — this could
      lead Russia to engage in a drastic escalation: not immediately to the use of nuclear
      weapons, but on a path that would point in that direction.8 For example, this
      could take the form of a more–or–less covert attack on Western infrastructure,
      justified in Moscow’s view as retaliation for the alleged U.S. destruction of
      Russia’s Nord Stream pipeline.9 Alternatively, Russia could knock out the U.S.
      satellites, which have provided the intelligence that has done so much to help
      Ukrainian military operations.10


      Such attacks would have the advantage of not leading directly to the deaths of
      Western citizens and so not leading to immediate NATO military retaliation. They
      would, however, put the United State and NATO in the position of having to choose
      between moving to a ceasefire, accepting further Russian attacks without retaliation,
      or retaliating in ways that could lead to a spiral of escalation. If it was not
      prepared to face either of the last two alternatives, the Biden administration
      would also have to step in quickly with a diplomatic initiative to end the fighting,
      along lines that would guarantee Ukraine not a total, but a very substantial and
      historic victory.


      A Russian breakthrough


      If, on the other hand, the Ukrainian offensive is defeated so badly that the Russian
      military is in a position to launch a successful counter–attack, seizing more
      Ukrainian territory, then Washington would have to choose between seeking a ceasefire
      that would leave existing occupied territory in Russian hands, or greatly increasing
      military aid to Ukraine.11


      In this scenario, however, such aid would probably not arrive quickly enough to
      save Ukraine from further territorial loss. The United States would then either
      have to commit itself to helping Ukraine launch a new counter–offensive next year,
      and if that fails the year after that, and so on; or of intervening in the war
      directly by sending U.S. military forces (something the Biden administration has
      strongly resisted), or – perhaps – of allowing Poland to intervene.12 The latter
      option would virtually guarantee Russian escalation per one of the scenarios described
      above.


      For example, the use of Polish air bases (whether by the United States, Poland,
      or both) to attack Russian forces in Ukraine would almost certainly lead to Russian
      missile attacks on those bases. An attack on a NATO member would bring Russia
      and NATO to the very brink of war – something that the Biden administration and
      the great majority of European governments have said they are determined to avoid.


      The direct involvement of U.S. forces on the side of Ukraine would also risk the
      end of Chinese refusal to give serious military aid to Russia. The Chinese government
      does not seem to have wanted the Russian invasion, and has lost much respect for
      the Putin regime as a result of Russian military failures, but Beijing cannot
      afford to see Russia completely defeated, eliminated as a great power and perhaps
      broken up as a state.13


      The defeat of Russia would greatly damage China’s own position in the world, cripple
      its energy security plans, and leave China without a single major security partner.
      China’s officials see a Russian defeat as a threat to the vital interests of the
      Chinese state. Should China start openly supporting Russia, then the war in Ukraine
      would become a proxy war between China and NATO, and Chinese military and strategic
      power would appear on the frontier of Europe; this scenario would not serve the
      interests of the West.


      The direct involvement of U.S. forces on the side of Ukraine would also risk the
      end of Chinese refusal to give serious military aid to Russia.


      Of course, the Biden administration could use the threat of increased aid or intervention
      to get Russia to stop its advance and negotiate. However, for such a strategy
      to work the threat would have to be credible, but so too would the incentive;
      the incentive being a U.S.–endorsed ceasefire that would freeze the existing battle–line
      and areas of Russian territorial control.


      A continued stalemate


      The third scenario for the outcome of the Ukrainian offensive is that while it
      fails to gain much ground, Russia is also not able to counter–attack successfully,
      leading to a military stalemate roughly along the current front line. This would
      also point towards negotiations for a ceasefire. The West’s willingness to continue
      providing massive support to Ukraine without real prospects for success would
      diminish; so, too, would both Russia and Ukraine’s hopes for early victory.14


      If neither side makes significant gains and the stalemate of recent months continues
      without a ceasefire, this will point towards a very protracted conflict, with
      deeply negative consequences for Ukraine, the United States, Europe, and the world.15
      Ukraine’s path towards the E.U. will be blocked. The risk of Western support collapsing
      at some point is real; in which case Ukraine would suffer a crushing defeat.


      Intensive talks on a ceasefire, initiated by the United States but garnering the
      support and involvement of other leading states, should begin as soon as the outcome
      of this year’s Ukrainian offensive is clear.


      On the other hand, there will be the perpetual risk of unintended escalation to
      nuclear annihilation. Russia will be pushed further into the arms of China. A
      further deterioration in relations between the United States and China could lead
      China to give massive military assistance to Russia, which could shift the situation
      on the battlefield in Russia’s favor. The disruption of world trade and finance
      would continue.


      Intensive talks on a ceasefire, initiated by the United States but garnering the
      support and involvement of other leading states, should therefore begin as soon
      as the outcome of this year’s Ukrainian offensive is clear. If the result of the
      Ukrainian offensive is an ongoing stalemate, achieving a ceasefire will be less
      urgent. All the same, there will be no excuse for delay. If neither side has succeeded
      in breaking through by late fall of this year, it is very unlikely that they will
      be able to do so next year either. In this case, there would be no point in prolonging
      a conflict that will lead to more death, suffering, economic loss and risks of
      escalation without a realistic goal.


      There are admittedly some downsides to achieving a ceasefire within the timeframe
      suggested. Unless Ukraine is able to recapture all the territory Russia has conquered
      since February 2022 (a highly unlikely prospect), at least some of this territory
      will remain in Russian hands, possibly for a longer time. This is not ideal, but
      as outlined above, stretching this war for much longer beyond early next year
      with no realistic prospect of success brings greater risks. And as discussed below,
      alternative approaches — such as intervening directly to achieve the complete
      defeat of Russia — are even worse.


      The Biden administration should therefore start thinking and planning immediately
      for negotiations to achieve a ceasefire by the end of this year, perhaps beginning
      with a truce over the New Year, between the Latin and Orthodox dates of Christmas.
      This truce could then be used for talks on a more lasting and stable ceasefire,
      together with the start of negotiations on a permanent peace settlement.


      Drivers and barriers to a ceasefire


      The most important motive for a ceasefire in both Ukraine and Russia is likely
      to be simple exhaustion. Estimates of casualties differ, but according to leaked
      documents, the Pentagon believes that Ukraine has suffered up to 131,000 dead
      and wounded and Russia up to 223,000 — much higher, but from a population more
      than three times greater than Ukraine’s.16 In addition, Russia has suffered especially
      heavy losses among its elite troops, especially in the first months of the war;
      while the conscripts recruited later are of very questionable quality.17 According
      to the Pentagon estimate, Russia has lost 2,068 tanks — more than four times Ukraine’s
      losses; and these tanks were mostly Russia’s latest models.


      Ukraine has a population strongly motivated to resist the Russian invasion, but
      its reserves of manpower are not endless; nor is the West’s willingness to provide
      massive support for the Ukrainian war effort.18 As of April 2023, Western financial
      aid accounted for well over half of Ukraine’s state budget, exclusive of military
      equipment and ammunition. Even so, Ukraine is running a budget deficit of around
      $5 billion per month. According to official figures, Ukraine’s GDP dropped by
      29 percent in 2022 as a result of the war.19


      Ukraine has a population strongly motivated to resist the Russian invasion, but
      its reserves of manpower are not endless; nor is the West’s willingness to provide
      massive support for the Ukrainian war effort.


      Furthermore, if the war continues to move from Ukrainian defense against Russian
      attacks to repeated Ukrainian attacks to drive Russia out completely, the motivation
      of the Ukrainian population to fight could diminish. At the start of the war,
      Ukrainians in the towns north of Kyiv that were occupied by Russia or menaced
      with Russian occupation showed a tremendous determination to resist. Local defense
      groups were formed spontaneously and fought with immense courage and success despite
      overwhelming Russian superiority in firepower and often in numbers. However, a
      willingness to fight and die in immediate defense of your home is not necessarily
      the same thing as a willingness to risk death to recapture territory hundreds
      of miles away, populated by people who generally speak Russian and remain significantly
      influenced by Soviet traditions.


      Ukrainian morale has been sustained to date in part by victories on the battlefield:
      the Russian retreat from the areas north of Kyiv and Chernihiv in April 2022;
      the Russian defeat in eastern Kharkiv in September; and the Russian retreat from
      Kherson city in November. Even the spirit of the very finest troops can, however,
      fail in the face of repeated disappointments.


      The French army in World War One launched offensive after bloody offensive for
      almost three years in the face of almost unimaginable losses; but in May 1917,
      when the latest French offensive ended in failure, the soldiers mutinied. At one
      point or another in the war, the morale of the Russian, Italian, Austro–Hungarian,
      and German armies also collapsed. While soldiers with whom I spoke in Ukraine
      expressed strong determination to fight on to complete victory, there have also
      been reports of channels on Telegram where people in Kyiv can tip each other off
      about places where the police are carrying out sweeps for potential conscripts,
      so that they can avoid them.20 The Ukrainian government has also imposed a ban
      on young men of military age leaving the country, which suggests that not everyone
      is anxious to serve.


      In Russia, evasion of service has been on a much larger scale. After the government
      announced a call-up of conscripts, an estimated 700,000 people left Russia, a
      large proportion of them reportedly young men of military age.21 As is clear from
      the Russian government’s long delay in extending conscription, and continued unwillingness
      to declare full mobilization along Ukrainian lines, the Kremlin is also worried
      about a public backlash if the sacrifices imposed on the population become too
      great. Both Ukraine and Russia have taken steps to suppress public opposition
      to the continuation of the war.22


      In terms of munitions, Russia retains a very considerable advantage over Ukraine,
      judging by reports of the expenditure of shells by the two sides in the battle
      for Bakhmut (though according to reports and from my own observations, Russian
      fire is often very inaccurate).23 However, the Russian armed forces do appear
      to be experiencing shortages of heavy missiles. This has led them to use S-300
      air defense missiles in a ground bombardment role, for which they are not designed
      and in which they have proved largely ineffective. Due to the limited scope and
      inaccuracy of the Russian air campaign against Ukraine’s energy infrastructure,
      as well as the effectiveness of Ukrainian air defenses, as of April 2023 this
      campaign had failed to have any really significant and lasting impact.24


      Russia’s economic situation has withstood the war and Western sanctions much better
      than many observers expected, in part because of the willingness of the non–Western
      world to continue buying Russian energy. According to World Bank estimates, GDP
      fell by only 2.1 percent in 2022 and is expected to drop by only 0.2 percent in
      2023.25 There are, however, reportedly serious concerns among Russian economists
      and state officials about the long–term sustainability of the Russian economy
      in the face of Western pressure, at least without significant aid from China.26


      For all these reasons, at some point this coming autumn or winter sheer exhaustion
      may lead both sides to accept a ceasefire. On the Russian side, our ability to
      assess the chances of the Kremlin doing this are limited by lack of clarity about
      Russia’s present war aims. However, the Russian withdrawal from the city of Kherson
      and the right bank of the Dnieper river last November would seem to indicate that
      Moscow has abandoned its most ambitious territorial claims, unless it achieves
      a complete transformation of its military situation, which is highly improbable.
      Without a bridgehead to the west of the Dnieper, it is impossible for Russia to
      pose a credible threat to the Ukrainian cities of Mykolaiv and Odessa and to Ukraine’s
      access to the sea.


      At some point this coming autumn or winter, sheer exhaustion may lead both sides
      to accept a ceasefire.


      Unless the territories “annexed” by Russia last year are already recaptured by
      Ukraine, returning them will be politically impossible for Russia. However, Russian
      officials have indicated that the precise borders of these provinces might be
      negotiable — which would seem to indicate a willingness in principle to accept
      a ceasefire that would leave parts of these provinces in Ukrainian hands.


      Russia is extremely unlikely voluntarily to return southern Zaporizhia and eastern
      Kherson to Ukraine as part of a ceasefire, because these areas make up the “land
      bridge” between Russia and Crimea; without it Crimea will be linked to Russia
      only by the Kerch Bridge, which has proved vulnerable to Ukrainian bombardment.27
      This would leave Crimea itself in acute danger of being reconquered by Ukraine
      in the event of a resumption of hostilities — and the Russian establishment is
      absolutely determined that Crimea and the naval base of Sevastopol remain in Russia’s
      hands, as indeed are most ordinary Russians (and, apparently, most Crimeans).28


      Such a Russian withdrawal from Kherson and Zaporizhia is therefore only imaginable
      (and even then, only after further defeats) as part of a final peace settlement
      involving Ukrainian and international recognition of Russian sovereignty over
      Crimea and the separatist Donbas republics on the territory that they controlled
      as of February 23, 2022, that would rule out future Ukrainian attempts to reconquer
      these territories.


      It is possible to achieve a lasting and at least relatively stable ceasefire while
      the underlying political and territorial issues remain unresolved.


      The Zelensky government has, as noted above, categorically ruled out a formal
      territorial compromise and has the support of the Ukrainian political elites and
      a majority of public opinion. However, as with the cases of Cyprus, Korea, and
      Taiwan (and, to a lesser extent, Kashmir from 1947 to the present and Northern
      Ireland from 1922–99), it is possible to achieve a lasting and at least relatively
      stable ceasefire while the underlying political and territorial issues remain
      unresolved.


      In the first month of the war, President Zelensky did indeed propose a compromise
      whereby Ukraine would declare neutrality (in return for strong security guarantees),
      Russia would withdraw to its pre–invasion de facto line of control, and the issue
      of sovereignty over Crimea and the eastern Donbas would be shelved for future
      negotiation. Under this proposal, both sides would have promised not to use either
      military or economic pressure (like the Ukrainian blockade of water supplies to
      Crimea) to change the situation on the ground.


      The willingness of at least some elements in the Ukrainian government to accept
      a de facto and provisional territorial compromise could be increased by the fact
      that Kyiv has no strategy for the peaceful political and cultural reintegration
      of Russian–speaking Crimea and the eastern Donbas into Ukraine. Instead, as former
      Zelensky advisor Oleksiy Arestovych has warned, many of the signals coming out
      of Ukraine point in the opposite direction.


      These include the banishing of the Russian language from public use, and racist
      insults (like Nyeliudy, “non–humans”) hurled by politicians and the media at all
      Russians and Russian culture as a whole.29 As to hardline members of the Ukrainian
      government, one of the most prominent, Mykhaylo Podolyak, has spoken openly of
      the need to drive out of Crimea all members of the local population who have supported
      Russian rule and want to go on using the Russian language in public.30


      The need for U.S. diplomatic engagement


      Even at the time, Ukraine’s hardliners were strongly opposed to Zelensky’s March
      2022 peace proposal; since then, Ukraine’s official position has hardened greatly
      as a result of both Russian defeats and Russian atrocities against Ukrainian civilians.
      As a result of its victories, the political influence of the Ukrainian military
      has also grown greatly, and its chief commanders appear strongly opposed even
      to a provisional and de facto territorial compromise. Ukrainian officials have
      publicly warned that for Zelensky to attempt a peace deal with Russia would mean
      his “political suicide.”31 Political observers in Kyiv have predicted that at
      some point the commander–in–chief of the Ukrainian military, General Valery Zaluzhny,
      will run for president, either to succeed Zelensky or in opposition to him.32


      Agreeing to a ceasefire would therefore be politically extremely difficult for
      President Zelensky, unless Ukraine were to suffer a very serious and obvious defeat,
      was in danger of losing much more territory, and could not expect increased help
      from the West.


      This is one key reason why Washington’s strong engagement in any ceasefire process
      is so essential. For the Ukrainian government to agree, Zelensky will probably
      need to be able to claim to his own people both that he was placed by Washington
      under irresistible pressure to agree to a ceasefire, and on the other hand that
      Washington had given really strong guarantees of future help to Ukraine if he
      did agree. The European Union would also have to guarantee continued large–scale
      economic aid.


      This should not, however, be linked to promises of an accelerated route to full
      EU membership. As the recently imposed restrictions on Ukrainian grain imports
      to the EU (demanded among other states by Poland, which is otherwise Ukraine’s
      greatest supporter within the EU) indicate, the nature of Ukraine’s economy and
      internal politics will make the process of EU accession a very long and complicated
      one, and it is important not to make promises that cannot be fulfilled.33


      Nor should Washington seek to use European countries as mediators in a ceasefire
      process. France under President Macron has sought to play this role, but the only
      result has been that the French government is now deeply distrusted by both Ukraine
      and Russia.34 The Ukrainian government regards France as a potential Russian ally
      in Europe. In Russia, by contrast, France’s failure to support the Minsk II agreement
      and to block future NATO expansion to Ukraine has left the impression that France’s
      expressions of desire for compromise with Russia are entirely mendacious.35 Viewed
      from Moscow, only an agreement fully and publicly backed by the United States
      can be relied on.


      The collapse of Minsk II is an object lesson in the centrality of the United States
      to any Ukrainian peace process. This agreement was brokered by France and Germany
      in 2015 to try to end the Donbas conflict. It provided for the return of the separatist
      areas of the Donbas in return for guarantees of full autonomy. There were several
      reasons for its failure, including Russia’s reluctance to make the separatists
      disarm as part of a settlement, but among the most important reasons was the refusal
      of successive Ukrainian governments and parliaments to provide that guarantee,
      and the West did not pressure them to do so.36


      Viewed from Moscow, only an agreement fully and publicly backed by the United
      States can be relied on.


      On their own, France and Germany were simply too weak, and too afraid of the reaction
      both from the United States and from other EU countries, to help make the Minsk
      II agreement stick by putting pressure on Ukraine as well as Russia. Only the
      full engagement of the United States could have achieved this — and no such engagement
      was forthcoming. By 2021, newly–appointed Biden administration officials were
      privately declaring Minsk II “dead” without suggesting (privately or publicly)
      something to replace it.37


      Nor in the years between 2015–22 did Washington do anything to rein in Ukrainian
      bombardments of the eastern Donbas and its attempts to pressure Crimea into submission
      through a blockade of its water supplies from Ukraine.38 This left Russians with
      the impression (rightly or wrongly) that the real Biden administration policy
      was simply future Ukrainian military reconquest of these territories, and may
      have contributed to Putin’s eventual decision to invade.


      The Biden administration should, however, try to enlist China’s help in persuading
      Russia to accept a ceasefire — but without the hectoring tone adopted so far,
      which has only served to anger Beijing.39 China has made clear that, while it
      does not wish to give significant military and economic aid to Russia, it will
      also not take sides against Russia. However, an agreement to end the fighting
      without a humiliating defeat for Putin could well seem attractive to Beijing.40


      The Biden administration should try to enlist China’s help in persuading Russia
      to accept a ceasefire.


      Secretary of State Anthony Blinken has correctly stated that one reason why China’s
      involvement in a peace process might be desirable is to prevent a situation in
      which Russia rebuilds its forces and attacks Ukraine again in future.41 This is
      entirely true, but also implies that Washington will have to promise Beijing sincerely
      that it will use its influence with Ukraine to prevent a future Ukrainian offensive.
      Given present levels of distrust between the United States and China, many in
      the Chinese government will suspect that Washington is using China to take responsibility
      for a ceasefire for which the United States itself will feel no responsibility.
      This, after all, was pretty much the story of U.S. policy towards the 2015 agreement
      brokered by France and Germany to solve the Donbas conflict.42


      Washington should also involve the United Nations in the search for peace in Ukraine.
      In the short term, as Ukrainian historian Taras Bilous has written, U.N. peacekeepers
      could play an essential role in stabilizing a ceasefire:


      On the one hand, if Russia is expelled, peacekeepers could be a soft capitulation
      to Russia. On the other hand, if the Ukrainian counteroffensive this year is less
      successful than Kyiv would like, a ceasefire will be necessary at some point.
      In this case, UN peacekeepers can also come in handy — not on the de-occupied
      territory, but on the demarcation line. But it’s important that this should entail
      not the recognition of annexed territory but rather the transfer of the confrontation
      over this issue to the diplomatic plane.43


      Why alternative policies are worse


      Opponents to a ceasefire argue that it would allow Russia to rebuild its forces
      and its economic base for a future invasion, which is indeed a possibility. This
      leads to the next argument: that to eliminate this possibility, Russia must be
      completely defeated in Ukraine, including the loss not just of the territories
      occupied in 2022, but Crimea and the eastern Donbas. Russian hardliners make almost
      a mirror image of this argument, that the United States is determined to use Ukraine
      as a base to weaken or even destroy Russia, and that only the complete defeat
      of Ukraine can eliminate this threat.


      The problem is that Russia has proved it is militarily incapable of conquering
      most of Ukraine, and that the strength of Ukrainian nationalism means that even
      if Russia could do so, it would find Ukraine as impossible to govern as Poland
      was in the past. The problem with this Western argument is that a complete Ukrainian
      military victory on Ukrainian soil would not in itself end the possibility of
      a future Russian invasion.


      On the one hand, Russia would retain a 1,226 mile-long border with Ukraine, across
      which it could once again invade the country. On the other, the loss of Crimea
      in particular would be extremely likely to lead to a mood of “revanche” in Russia
      that (like the French obsession with the recovery of Alsace–Lorraine after 1871)
      would mean that all subsequent Russian administrations would make its recovery
      the pivot of their entire international strategy. This would mean that the United
      States and Europe in turn would have to make the defense of Ukraine the pivot
      of their entire international strategy, regardless of the impact of this on arguably
      far greater interests and dangers elsewhere.


      The loss of Crimea in particular would be extremely likely to lead to a mood of
      “revanche” in Russia that would mean that all subsequent Russian administrations
      would make its recovery the pivot of their entire international strategy.


      The only way in which the risk of a future Russian invasion could be completely
      removed would be by the destruction of Russia as a united state — and that is
      indeed the ambition of many of those, both in Ukraine and the West, who are calling
      for complete Ukrainian victory. Their hope is that the crushing humiliation of
      complete defeat in Ukraine and the loss of Crimea would lead to the fall of the
      Putin regime, and that given the underlying weaknesses of its state system, the
      Russian Federation would then break up, just as the Soviet Union did once the
      power of the Communist Party evaporated.44 According to Oleksiy Danilov, Secretary
      of Ukraine’s National Security and Defense Council:


      [Russia is] a monstrous entity with cave instincts and an anti-human essence that
      has no place in the modern world order. Russia with its autocratic regime, resource-based
      economy and neo-fascist ideology once again has failed to pass the civilization
      test, remaining a territory of continuous violence and evil, a threat to Ukraine
      and the world… Given the negative historical experience, there is a danger that
      after some time Russia will again return to the old bloody pattern. Therefore,
      the process must be much deeper and more complex, with results that guarantee
      high reliability. This can only be the disintegration and fragmentation of the
      fake [Russian] federation.45


      The reasoning here suffers from numerous dangerous flaws.46 Unlike the Soviet
      Union, the Russian Federation contains a large majority of ethnic Russians, bound
      together (as the public response to the war in Ukraine indicates) by a strong
      sense of Russian nationalism and attachment to the Russian state. Unlike in the
      Soviet Union, the most important non–Russian ethnic republic, Tatarstan, is situated
      not on the geographic periphery of the state, but at its center, making secession
      exceptionally difficult and dangerous, even if a majority of the local population
      desired this.


      To judge by my own travels in the more distant Russian regions, in Siberia and
      the Far East, the great majority of their populations are far too worried about
      domination by China to risk independence. These are the same reasons Russia did
      not break up in the 1990s, despite the crippling weakness of the central Russian
      state during that time. Unlike the former “union republics” of the USSR, the constituent
      parts of the Russian Federation have no constitutional right of secession, and
      no automatic right of recognition by the international community.


      Equally importantly, to attempt the destruction of a nuclear superpower (or even
      its regime) would be the most dangerous enterprise ever embarked upon by a U.S.
      administration. Faced with complete defeat in Ukraine, radical escalation by the
      Putin regime would seem not only possible but likely, if they believed their own
      survival was at stake. This would most likely take the form not of an immediate
      recourse to tactical nuclear weapons on the battlefield in Ukraine, but rather
      steps that would begin a spiral of escalation, the logical end–point of which
      would be a full–scale nuclear exchange and the destruction of the world as we
      know it.


      To attempt the destruction of a nuclear superpower would be the most dangerous
      enterprise ever embarked upon by a U.S. administration.


      Finally, Beijing has so far refrained from giving serious military and economic
      aid to Russia, fearing this would drive Europe into full support for sanctions
      against and economic decoupling from China. However, while Chinese respect for
      Russia has diminished greatly as a result of Russian military failures in Ukraine,
      China’s government still regards Russia as an essential partner against the United
      States, as well as an essential and secure supplier of energy to China.


      There is no reason to doubt, therefore, that China would regard the elimination
      or radical weakening of the Russian state as a threat to Chinese vital interests,
      and that in consequence it would feel obliged to give massive help to Moscow to
      prevent this happening. This would transform Ukraine into the site of a proxy
      war between the West and China, with extremely negative consequences for everyone
      concerned and Ukrainians above all.


      Conclusions


      Given that the alternatives are so dangerous, the Biden administration should
      begin immediately to lay the diplomatic groundwork for ceasefire negotiations,
      to begin in earnest once the results of the Ukrainian offensive are clear. This
      should involve reaching out to all countries that can bring positive influence
      to bear, including most notably China, but also major Global South states such
      as India and Brazil. However, it is also very important for the administration
      to recognize that it must be fully involved in the ceasefire process.


      Whatever happens, by far the greater part of Ukraine will now be aligned with
      the West and deeply hostile to Russia. This reverses the pattern of almost 400
      years of Russian–Ukrainian history and represents a crushing defeat for Russia.


      The administration should also back up the process with a shift in its domestic
      rhetoric that would acknowledge the extent of the victory that Ukraine, with U.S.
      and Western help, has already won — as indeed EU Commission President Ursula von
      der Leyen has boasted.47 Putin’s original plan to subjugate the whole of Ukraine
      has already been comprehensively defeated, and almost certainly cannot be revived.
      Whatever happens, by far the greater part of Ukraine will now be aligned with
      the West and deeply hostile to Russia. This reverses the pattern of almost 400
      years of Russian–Ukrainian history and represents a crushing defeat for Russia.48


      Continued internationally–unrecognized control over relatively limited areas of
      eastern and southern Ukraine is a very poor consolation prize for Moscow. A ceasefire
      that allowed this, while not a complete Ukrainian and Western victory, would still,
      in historical terms, be a very severe Russian failure. On the other hand, allowing
      the Kremlin to claim (however mendaciously) to the Russian people that it had
      achieved a measure of success, could be enough both to end the fighting and prevent
      large–scale clashes in future.


      Given the extent of Russian losses and defeats in this war, it seems highly unlikely
      that, given a reasonably stable ceasefire backed by the United States and continued
      control over Crimea, a future Russian government would wish to launch a new invasion
      — unless Western aid to Ukraine were to cease altogether. But for that to happen,
      the United States would have had to lose or abandon its superpower position —
      and at that point, everything would have changed, not just in Ukraine but in the
      world in general.


      As Oxana Shevel wrote in an article for Boston Review:


      A stalemate on the battlefield might lead to an armistice—an outcome that would
      not “end the war” but would be more advantageous to Ukraine and to the West’s
      goal of achieving stability in Europe.49


      Shevel points out that such an armistice would allow the West to begin the massive
      task of rebuilding the Ukrainian economy and helping Ukraine move towards EU membership.
      She also argues that it should be used to allow Ukraine to join NATO. This is
      in fact extremely unlikely in circumstances of a legally unresolved conflict.
      However, it is also irrelevant. The U.S. and NATO have repeatedly said and shown
      that they will not send their own troops and go to war with Russia in order to
      defend Ukraine. This is due above all to well–based fears that this could lead
      to nuclear annihilation; and these fears and resulting constraints will remain
      even if Ukraine becomes a member of NATO. This being so, how in practice would
      NATO membership actually help to defend Ukraine more than it is being helped at
      the moment by huge NATO aid?50 On the other hand, NATO states have also demonstrated
      that they are willing to give massive military and civil assistance to help Ukraine
      successfully to defend itself — and that will be a strong deterrent to any future
      Russian aggression.


      Above all, U.S. officials and elected representatives need to remember that their
      primary responsibility is to the sovereign people of the United States, to whom
      they have sworn an oath of loyalty. There are certainly very important issues
      at stake in Ukraine; but the most critical of these — the preservation of Ukraine
      as an independent state — has already been achieved. The next great task is to
      help Ukraine achieve the most important aspect of integration into the West, namely
      EU membership. But that process cannot even begin as long as the war continues.
      No remaining American goal is worth unending war and the risk of a nuclear exchange
      that would destroy the United States.


      There are certainly very important issues at stake in Ukraine; but the most critical
      of these — the preservation of Ukraine as an independent state — has already been
      achieved.


      The kind of ceasefire agreement outlined in this paper will be both unsatisfactory
      and extremely difficult to achieve and to sell. It will require considerable political
      courage on the part of the Biden administration; but, in the old drill sergeant’s
      phrase, “Nobody ever said this was going to be easy.”'

    url: https://quincyinst.org/research/the-threat-of-new-wars-in-the-caucasus-a-good-case-for-u-s-restraint/
    text: 'Executive Summary The decline of Russian power due to military defeats in
      Ukraine risks leading to increased violence and instability in the Caucasus and
      Central Asia. The effects of this can already be seen in the flare–up of fighting
      between Azerbaijan and Armenia, inadequately checked by Russian peacekeepers.
      This shift in power creates a temptation for Washington to increase its involvement
      in the region in an effort to end Russian influence there. This temptation should
      be resisted. The United States has no vital national interest in this region —
      certainly not ones that are worth the risk of new wars. The conflicts in the southern
      Caucasus are deeply intractable, and have roots that long predate the Soviet collapse
      and indeed the Soviet Union itself. They were not created by Russia, and cannot
      be solved by the United States. Increased support for Georgia risks empowering
      a new attempt by Georgia to retake its lost territories by force, leading to another
      war with Russia, the outcome of which would be uncertain and highly dangerous.
      Increased support for Azerbaijan threatens Armenia and would create a fierce backlash
      in the Armenian–American community. Instead, the United States should continue
      to play a helpful but limited diplomatic role, aimed not at solving these disputes
      but at reducing tensions and preventing new eruptions of violence. Policy recommendations:
      • The United States should not seek to drive Russian influence from the southern
      Caucasus. It should accept that as a local great power they have an important
      stake in this region, and try to help craft international approaches that take
      this into account. • In particular, the Biden administration should do nothing
      to encourage Georgia to resume war for the reconquest of Abkhazia and South Ossetia.
      • Together with European partners and the U.N., the U.S. government should continue
      its existing and praiseworthy diplomatic efforts to reduce tensions between the
      different sides and maintain existing ceasefires.


      Introduction


      As Russia’s military power and prestige decay due to losses and defeats in Ukraine,
      Russia’s ability to control frozen conflicts and tensions elsewhere in the lands
      of the former Soviet Union is also deteriorating, and there is a serious danger
      that these conflicts will reignite.1 Given the dire state of current relations
      between the United States and Russia, U.S. administrations may be tempted to intervene
      in such conflicts as part of an effort to roll back Russian influence. This temptation
      should be resisted. The consequences for the region would be dire, and the consequences
      for American goals limited or negative.


      The United States has no vital national interests in the southern Caucasus, although
      the Armenian–American community feels the strongest possible interest in the safety
      and survival of Armenia. Nor does the United States possess either a strategy
      or the ability to control the consequences of new wars — with the result that
      these consequences could turn out to be negative for U.S. interests and U.S. values
      as well as for the people of the regions concerned.


      Russia’s influence in the former Soviet space has not been as uniformly negative
      as the invasion of Ukraine has suggested; in parts of that region Russia has acted
      to maintain stability and to contain the infiltration and spread of militants
      such as the Islamic State and Al–Qaeda and its direct affiliates that are also
      bitter enemies of the United States. Finally, a chaotic vacuum that could draw
      in Chinese power would certainly not be in the geopolitical interests of the United
      States.


      As Russia’s military power and prestige decay due to losses and defeats in Ukraine,
      Russia’s ability to control frozen conflicts and tensions elsewhere in the lands
      of the former Soviet Union is also deteriorating, and there is a serious danger
      that these conflicts will reignite.


      Thus in Central Asia, Russian forces have been instrumental in helping to defend
      Tajikistan from the spread of Islamist extremism from Afghanistan. The border
      conflict between Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan in September 2022 may also be due in
      part to a declining Russian ability to influence relations between these countries.
      This clash led to dozens of deaths and more than 100,000 people becoming refugees.
      Similar border issues exist between several states in Central Asia.


      The most immediate threat of renewed conflict, however, exists in the Caucasus,
      where heavy fighting has broken out between Azerbaijan and Armenia, and the Russian
      peacekeepers who have maintained relative stability in Nagorno Karabakh since
      the war of 2020 no longer seem capable of doing so. Russian forces have also been
      withdrawn from Armenia to reinforce the Russian war in Ukraine, calling into question
      Russia’s ability to maintain its commitment to defend Armenia itself against Azerbaijan
      and Turkey.


      Georgia for its part has an obvious interest in reversing the victories of Russia
      and her separatist allies in the wars of 2008 and the early 1990s. In the Russian
      northern Caucasus, discontent is surging in Dagestan as a result of strong local
      resistance to the conscription of local men for the war in Ukraine, and could
      encourage renewed Islamist radicalism, which claimed numerous victims in the past.2
      A decline of Russian influence in the southern Caucasus may undermine Russian
      control of the northern Caucasus as well. It is on the Caucasus, therefore, that
      this paper will concentrate.


      The aftermath of empire


      The wars of the former Soviet Union are best viewed in the wider context of the
      end of empire — something that has all too often involved or led to serious conflicts.
      Indeed, it is rather hard to think of an example in modern history where this
      has not been the case. Sometimes these conflicts stemmed from the last-ditch attempts
      of imperial powers to retain their control; sometimes from older rivalries that
      empire had suppressed; sometimes from changes — social, economic, political but
      above all demographic — brought about by empire; often from a combination of all
      these elements.


      The wars of the former Soviet Union are best viewed in the wider context of the
      end of empire — something that has all too often involved or led to serious conflicts.


      South Asia is still living with the consequences of the conflicts that resulted
      from the end of the British Indian empire, including most notably the bloody partition
      of India and Pakistan, and the resulting conflict over Kashmir. As South Asia
      also indicates, conflicts ultimately spawned or worsened by empires and their
      fall can simmer for decades before breaking out: as with the revolt of the East
      Bengalis against Pakistan in 1971 (leading to Indian intervention and the creation
      of Bangladesh), and the civil war between Tamils and Sinhalese in Sri Lanka, which
      erupted in 1983, 36 years after Sri Lanka became independent.


      In Africa, innumerable local conflicts can be traced back at least in part to
      empire and how empire was dismantled. The Middle East is in many ways still working
      through the consequences of the collapse of three empires, the Ottoman, British,
      and French; while the Balkans too are still living with the results of the Ottoman
      and Habsburg empires and their collapse.


      The parts played by empires in helping to generate these conflicts vary from case
      to case; and, while sometimes the empires themselves were culpable, sometimes
      they found themselves responsible for local issues that they could contain but
      not solve. For in many cases, one insoluble element was the creation of modern
      exclusive nation states in areas where no such institutions had previously been
      known, and where the intermingling of populations made ethnically–based states
      an automatic recipe for conflict.


      Many of the conflicts and tensions that accompanied and followed the end of the
      Soviet Union have fallen into these wider imperial and post-imperial patterns.
      In the Caucasus, the Soviet Union established ethnic republics that, after independence,
      found themselves bitterly at odds with ethnic minorities that had not previously
      lived under their rule, or had done so very unhappily. Armenians revolted against
      Azerbaijan; Abkhaz and Ossetes against Georgia; Chechens against Russia.


      The Soviet Union moved Russians to work in the factories of Latvia and Estonia
      just as the British moved Chinese to Malaya and Indians to Fiji. After independence,
      Latvia and Estonia established an informal understanding with the Russian minorities
      rather similar to that of Malaysia. Under this arrangement, ethnic Latvians and
      Estonians monopolize the government and the security services while the Russian–speaking
      minority dominates the commercial economy.


      Despite these common patterns, a very significant difference exists between the
      maritime empires of western Europe and the land empires of Turkey, Russia/USSR,
      and Austria/Germany. However nasty some of the conflicts involved in the fall
      of empire, the imperial power could in the end escape them (and responsibility
      for them) by returning home over the sea. For the land empires (including Britain
      in Ireland) no such clear–cut escape was possible. They had to live with post–imperial
      disputes and conflicts on their own borders, and overlapping those borders. On
      the one hand, some of their own ethnic minorities saw no reason why when the rest
      of the empire had collapsed, they too should not have the right to the independence
      enjoyed by others a few meters across the new national frontier. On the other
      hand, their own co–ethnics left stranded in neighboring states inevitably looked
      to their mother country for support and protection.


      In continental Europe and its immediate periphery, the end of the Soviet Union
      and Yugoslavia (a country that was itself the unhappy offspring of the end of
      the Ottoman and Austrian empires) have left behind eight unsolved conflicts and
      territorial disputes: Bosnia, Kosovo, Transdniestria, Crimea, the Donbas, Abkhazia,
      South Ossetia and Nagorno–Karabakh.


      Nagorno–Karabakh


      Clashes between Armenians and Azeris in Nagorno–Karabakh in modern times predate
      the Soviet Union. They occurred when Russian imperial control weakened during
      the 1905 revolution, and again after the empire collapsed in 1917. The basic frame
      of the conflict is that the mountainous (“Nagorno” in Russian) part of Karabakh
      contains an ancient Armenian Christian population, which, from the 11th century
      C.E., came to be surrounded by territory where Azeri Turkic Muslims predominate.3


      These Azeri lands cut Nagorno–Karabakh off from what after 1920 was to become
      first the Soviet republic of Armenia and then, after 1991, the independent Republic
      of Armenia. However, until the war of 1988–94, Nagorno–Karabakh in turn contained
      an Azeri minority of around one third, and the town of Shusha, a center of both
      Armenian and Azeri religious tradition and culture.


      After the establishment of Soviet power in the southern Caucasus, Nagorno–Karabakh
      in 1923 was turned into an autonomous region (oblast) within the Azerbaijani Soviet
      Socialist Republic, separated by a strip of Azerbaijani territory from the Armenian
      Soviet republic.4 This arrangement was never really accepted by the Armenians
      either of Karabakh or of Armenia, and after Stalin’s death there were several
      attempts by the Armenian Communist leadership to have the territory transferred
      to Armenia. These petitions were all rejected by the Soviet government in Moscow,
      which feared — rightly — the ethnic conflict that would result.5


      When Mikhail Gorbachev relaxed Soviet control in the mid 1980s, a new push by
      Armenians was the virtually inevitable result. In early 1988 the local Assembly
      (parliament) of the NK autonomous region passed a resolution to transfer the oblast
      to the Armenian SSR and sought approval for this from Moscow. Huge demonstrations
      took place in Armenia in support of this move. In a spiral of escalation that
      was to become disastrously familiar elsewhere in the Soviet Union, the Azerbaijani
      government responded by abolishing NK’s autonomous status. The Soviet government
      for its part rejected both moves and sought to insist on the maintenance of the
      status quo.


      Clashes between Armenians and Azeris in Nagorno–Karabakh in modern times predate
      the Soviet Union.


      Conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan escalated, and led to ethnic cleansing
      of minority populations on both sides, inadequately checked by Soviet internal
      security forces, and eventually leading to the complete removal of the Armenian
      minority from Azerbaijan and the Azeri minority from Armenia. In both cases, Armenian
      and Azerbaijani police units were heavily involved in the expulsions.


      When the Soviet Union collapsed following the failed coup of August 1991, both
      Armenia and Azerbaijan declared independence and this was recognized by the international
      community and the new state of Russia. In December 1991, the Armenian majority
      in NK, with the support of Armenia, also voted for independence from Azerbaijan,
      but as in all other cases (Chechnya, Abkhazia, South Ossetia, Crimea) this vote
      was not recognized internationally or by Moscow, on the principle that only the
      fifteen “union republics” of the former Soviet Union had the legal right to independence
      under the Soviet constitution.


      The result was full scale war, in which the Armenians won a series of crushing
      victories, with some help from Russia and a great deal from the Armenian diaspora
      in the West. Some 30,000 people died on both sides and hundreds of thousands became
      refugees. In May 1994, the Russian government brokered a ceasefire, which left
      Armenian forces in full control not only of NK itself but of several surrounding
      regions of Azerbaijan proper. Despite periodic armed clashes, this situation was
      to remain basically unchanged until 2020.


      The intervening quarter of a century saw repeated attempts to resolve the conflict,
      led by the “Minsk Group,” including both Russia and Western countries, set up
      by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). All these attempts
      foundered on the basic problem that Armenia could not accept any solution that
      would place the Armenians of NK under the control of the Azerbaijani security
      forces, while Azerbaijan could not accept any solution that would leave NK with
      its own army — in part because this in turn would make the return of Azeri refugees
      to the region impossible.


      Both Russia and the West have been ambiguous in their responses to the NK conflict.
      Russia is tied to Armenia by the fact that as relations between Russia and Georgia
      worsened, Armenia became Russia’s only ally in the southern Caucasus, and one
      of the very few in the former Soviet Union as a whole. Russia and Armenia have
      a defensive alliance (which does not cover NK), and Armenia hosts a Russian brigade,
      anti-aircraft batteries, and several air force squadrons.6


      This alliance has been strongly desired by Armenia, which has a traditional dread
      of its vast Turkish neighbor to the West, and of the close relationship between
      Turkey and Azerbaijan. On the other hand, Russia has not wished to break with
      Azerbaijan, partly for fear that in this case, Azerbaijan might become an ally
      of the United States. As Turkey has moved away from the Western alliance, maintaining
      good relations with Istanbul has become a critical part of Russian strategy, especially
      since the invasion of Ukraine and Russia’s own isolation from the West. Two days
      before Russia’s full–scale invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022, Russia and
      Azerbaijan signed a comprehensive agreement on cooperation, described by President
      Ilham Aliyev of Azerbaijan (inaccurately but significantly) as an “alliance.”
      An obvious Russian attempt to ensure Azerbaijani neutrality in the Ukraine conflict,
      this agreement caused deep unease in Armenia.7


      The United States has had an obvious interest in good relations with Azerbaijan
      due to that country’s considerable oil and gas reserves under the Caspian Sea.
      These have gained a new importance as a result of the cuts in Russian gas supplies
      to Europe consequent on the Ukraine war and Western sanctions.8 Azerbaijan is
      also seen by sections of the U.S. security establishment as a potential ally against
      both Russia and Iran. Close relations between Azerbaijan and Israel also aid Washington’s
      goal of putting pressure on Tehran.


      The presence of a large (though mostly well–integrated) Azeri minority in northern
      Iran has led to Iranian fears of separatism backed by Baku and Washington, and
      to considerable Iranian help for Armenia, above all in the form of energy supplies.
      Western moves towards alignment with Azerbaijan were however severely hampered
      by the Armenian communities in America and France, which used their political
      leverage to ensure sympathy for Armenia. The large Armenian diaspora in Russia
      has also used its influence to this end.


      During these years, Azerbaijan’s revenues from oil and gas allowed it to build
      up well–armed forces, helped by Turkey and including the purchase of Israeli weaponry.
      In September 2020, Azerbaijan launched a successful offensive that recaptured
      most of the Azeri territories around NK and a large part of NK itself. The war
      was brought to an end by a ceasefire brokered by Russia that involved the deployment
      of Russian peacekeepers to NK and the corridor linking NK to Armenia.9 It is this
      precarious Russian–imposed ceasefire that is now in danger as a result of the
      Russian defeats in Ukraine and the general decline of Russian power and prestige.


      After the second Nagorno–Karabakh war


      Since 2020, talks on the status of the remaining parts of NK have remained deadlocked.
      Russia, however, has sought to compensate Azerbaijan through the promotion of
      an Azerbaijani transport corridor linking Azerbaijan to the Azerbaijani exclave
      of Nakhichevan, and through Nakhichevan to Turkey and the West — a plan that also
      reflects Russia’s growing desire for good relations with Turkey. Armenia has agreed
      to discuss this, despite great anxieties on the subject both in Armenia and in
      Iran, which fears any expansion of Azerbaijani power along its northern border.
      To signal its concern, Iran in October 2021 and 2022 held military exercises along
      its border with Azerbaijan.10


      The possibility of close Russian–Iranian cooperation in the Caucasus against a
      stronger role for America has been increased by the closer military ties established
      as a result of the war in Ukraine, where Russian forces have started to use Iranian
      drones to considerable effect.11


      Following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, a new chapter unfolded in the South
      Caucasus. Baku used the Ukraine war to begin testing Moscow’s resolve and its
      peacekeeping mission in Nagorno-Karabakh. In the late summer of 2022 Azerbaijan,
      in an unprecedented step, moved several kilometers into Armenia–proper, following
      Russia’s strategic setback in Kharkiv.


      Since 2020, talks on the status of the remaining parts of NK have remained deadlocked.


      Russia’s failure to respond — despite the Russian-Armenian Treaty and Yerevan’s
      membership in the Collective Security Treaty Organization — seriously weakened
      Armenian faith in the Russian alliance, and led to Armenian overtures to Washington.12
      The September escalation was ended through a U.S.–brokered ceasefire.


      The latest outbreak of fighting was also followed by a visit to Armenia (very
      pointedly, not to Azerbaijan) by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in September 2022,
      accompanied by two Armenian–American members of Congress. During this visit, Pelosi
      made a number of unconditionally pro–Armenian and anti–Azerbaijani statements
      — a sign of how the electoral calculations of the U.S. Congress may differ from
      the strategic ones of the U.S. security establishment.13 Washington and the European
      Union are also somewhat hampered in their attempts at alignment with Azerbaijan
      by the fact that Azerbaijan is an unabashed hereditary dictatorship of the Aliyev
      dynasty, whereas Armenia is a democracy, albeit a flawed one.14


      The EU has also taken a new interest in the situation between Armenia and Azerbaijan.
      European Council President Charles Michel has hosted multiple rounds of talks
      between Prime Minister Pashinyan of Armenia and President Aliyev of Azerbaijan
      aimed at the creation of a lasting peace settlement.


      Developments in late November 2022 however demonstrated the extreme difficulties
      facing any effort at outside mediation. On the one hand, at the summit of the
      Russian–led Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) in Yerevan on November
      24, Putin was subjected to fierce criticism by Armenian President Nikol Pashinyan
      and the Armenian media for the failure of Russia and the CSTO to defend Armenia
      against Azerbaijan (which is not a CSTO member).15 Instead, the Armenian government
      asked France (which has a large and influential Armenian minority) to mediate
      in the NK conflict. In the words of Professor Emil Avdaliani:


      “The protests indicate a shift in Armenia’s perception of Russia. Its unreliability
      as an ally has grown palpable. Anti-Russian sentiments always were present among
      Armenia’s political elites, but now it turns into resentment. The protests benefited
      Pashinyan as it allowed him to show that Armenia needs concrete guarantees and
      not just empty promises. This does not mean that Armenia will be withdrawing from
      CSTO, but just that Yerevan tries to influence the negative dynamics in the grouping.”16


      The proposal of French mediation was, however, immediately rejected by Azerbaijan.
      President Ilham Aliyev canceled talks, scheduled for December 7 with Armenia in
      Brussels, to be mediated by France and the EU, and declared that Azerbaijan would
      reject any further French participation in talks, adding that France’s expressions
      of support for Armenian sovereignty displayed French bias and had “insulted” Azerbaijan.17


      And while Armenia is trying to attract French and European support partially to
      replace that of Russia, it faces one probably insuperable obstacle. France and
      the EU are not going to provide “concrete guarantees” to Armenia either. For all
      its increased weakness, Russia still has troops in Armenia that provide a final
      barrier to an Azeri or Turkish invasion of Armenia proper. There seems very little
      chance indeed that France — let alone the rest of the EU — would be willing or
      able to deploy troops to the Caucasus, or extend a military guarantee (including
      a nuclear deterrent) to Armenia, as Russia has done.


      For all its increased weakness, Russia still has troops in Armenia that provide
      a final barrier to an Azeri or Turkish invasion of Armenia proper. There seems
      very little chance indeed that France — let alone the rest of the EU — would be
      willing or able to deploy troops to the Caucasus.


      The limitation of French and EU influence also brings out a fundamental problem
      of the NK peace process, already mentioned: that there can be no real security
      for Armenians within Azerbaijan or Azeris within Armenia, without the presence
      of large, long-term and neutral peacekeeping forces (as in Bosnia).18 Without
      the deployment of U.S. peacekeepers there is, therefore, no possibility of the
      United States playing a decisive role in bringing the Nagorno–Karabakh War to
      an end and controlling the subsequent situation in the region. To dispatch such
      a force would however be an extremely reckless move from a strategic and military
      point of view. It would be bitterly opposed by both Russia and Iran. Given the
      increasingly difficult state of U.S.–Turkish relations, it would also be very
      unlikely to be welcomed by Turkey.


      A U.S. force would, therefore, have to be established and maintained in the face
      of hostility from all three of the region’s great powers, which between them control
      all the land borders of the southern Caucasus. In the event of a further deterioration
      of relations with Russia or Iran (or both), such a force would be acutely endangered.


      A U.S. engagement that compelled Armenian hostility to Iran would, however, not
      be welcome to Armenia; nor would it be in America’s interest to expose itself
      to the risks accompanied with such a military presence. In the first place, despite
      recent disillusionment with Russia, it remains deeply engraved in Armenian historical
      memory that after the World War One, the Western powers, including America, did
      nothing to live up to their pro–Armenian rhetoric, and that it was only the intervention
      of the Soviet army that prevented the destruction of Armenia by Turkey and Azerbaijan.
      In the words of one Armenian–American in Yerevan after Pelosi’s visit:


      “It’s important to see the U.S. finally stepping up and recognizing what is going
      on here. But warm words aren’t everything. We need tangible support to help stop
      those who want to wipe us off the map.”19


      Second, a U.S. attempt to replace Russia would undoubtedly be strongly resisted
      by Moscow; and while Russian military power has declined steeply since the start
      of the war in Ukraine, Russia retains considerable ability to destabilize Armenian
      internal politics. Finally, the establishment of a U.S. military presence in the
      Caucasus would very likely embolden Georgia to make a fresh attempt to regain
      its own lost territories of Abkhazia and South Ossetia by force of arms. It is
      to these frozen conflicts that we now turn.


      The South Ossetian conflict


      The wars in the Georgian autonomous territories of Abkhazia and South Ossetia
      had the same basic origins as the war over Nagorno–Karabakh, though also with
      specific differences.20 Of these, the most important has been a far greater degree
      of direct Russian involvement on the side of the separatists. In both cases, ethnic
      tensions predated the establishment of Soviet control. South Ossetia saw heavy
      fighting between local Ossetes and Georgian forces during the period of Georgian
      independence from 1918–21, in which several thousand people died.


      The Georgian autonomous region of South Ossetia was created for the local majority
      of Ossetes, a people who speak a language related to Persian (Farsi), and very
      distinct from Georgian.21 A majority of Ossetes live in the Russian autonomous
      republic of North Ossetia, and desire for union between the two Ossete regions
      was a principal driver of the southern Ossete separatist movement. South Ossetia,
      however, also included a Georgian ethnic minority of around 40 percent, and the
      grant of autonomy within Georgia was a Soviet compromise that could really only
      work as long as the Soviet Union itself survived.


      Nationalism in South Ossetia rose largely in response to the growth of the national
      independence movement in Georgia itself, both because of that movement’s strongly
      ethno–nationalist character, and because, if Georgia were to become independent,
      that would lead to the northern and southern Ossetes being separated by an international
      frontier.


      Matters came to a head as a result of the Georgian parliamentary elections of
      October 1990, which resulted in victory for the nationalist Round Table–Free Georgia
      coalition led by Zviad Gamsakhurdia, whose speeches had included strongly anti–Ossete
      remarks. The result was a declaration of “sovereignty” (a highly ambiguous term
      somewhere between enhanced autonomy and independence) by the Ossete majority in
      the Southern Ossete regional assembly. In response, the Georgian government abolished
      Southern Ossete autonomy and dispatched Georgian police and nationalist volunteers
      to South Ossetia, which carried out abuses against the Ossete population.22 Soviet
      interior ministry troops were then deployed to separate the two sides.


      After the failed Soviet coup of August 1991, Georgia became independent. South
      Ossetia also declared independence from Georgia, and remained a separate area
      under Russian military protection, though Russia continued formally to recognize
      Georgian sovereignty. A ceasefire, punctuated by occasional clashes, remained
      in place until August 2008.


      In that month, the Georgian nationalist government of Mikel Saakashvili, emboldened
      by the U.S. proposal of NATO membership for Georgia, and apparently expecting
      U.S. military support, launched an attempt to reconquer the whole of South Ossetia,
      which besieged the Russian peacekeeping force there. Russia then launched a counter–attack
      that defeated the Georgians and expelled them from South Ossetia altogether.


      The most balanced and objective report on the origins of the Russo–Georgian War
      of August 2008 was produced by Heidi Tagliavini on behalf of the E.U. While by
      no means exonerating Russia and South Ossetia for their share of responsibility
      for the clashes leading up to the war, the report states clearly that full–scale
      war was initiated by Georgia. According to the report, the war began with:


      “a large-scale Georgian military operation against the town of Tskhinvali and
      the surrounding areas, launched in the night of 7 to 8 August 2008″ although this
      “was only the culminating point of a long period of increasing tensions, provocations
      and incidents.”23


      The war was followed by Russian recognition of Southern Ossete independence, though
      only five member states of the U.N. have followed suit. Since 2008, the conflict
      has been effectively frozen.


      The Abkhaz conflict


      In Abkhazia, as in Nagorno–Karabakh, the relaxation of Soviet authoritarianism
      under Mikhail Gorbachev in the late 1980s led to a surge in longstanding demands
      by the indigenous Abkhaz population (closely related to the Circassian minorities
      of the Russian North Caucasus) for separation from Georgia.24 Abkhaz demanded
      the restoration of the status of a union republic that Abkhazia had enjoyed (in
      a somewhat qualified fashion) between the establishment of the Soviet Union and
      Joseph Stalin’s incorporation of Abkhazia into Georgia (as an autonomous republic)
      in 1931.25


      In Abkhazia, as in Nagorno–Karabakh, the relaxation of Soviet authoritarianism
      under Mikhail Gorbachev in the late 1980s led to a surge in longstanding demands
      by the indigenous Abkhaz population.


      The rule of Stalin (himself an ethnic Georgian) initiated a period of “Georgianization”
      of Abkhazia, including the large–scale movement of Georgians into the region.
      By the end of Soviet rule, ethnic Abkhaz had been reduced to a mere 19 percent
      of Abkhazia’s population. The Abkhaz population had already been severely reduced
      by the flight of tens of thousands of Muslim Abkhaz to the Ottoman Empire as a
      result of the Russian imperial conquest of Abkhazia in the mid-19th century.


      In the last years of the Soviet Union, ethnic Georgians made up 45.7 percent of
      Abkhazia’s population, with the remaining 35 percent made up chiefly of ethnic
      Russians and Armenians attracted to Abkhazia by its role as one of the tourist
      centers of the Soviet Union, together with a small ancient population of Pontic
      Greeks. In the Soviet referendum of March 1991 on maintaining the Soviet Union,
      the overwhelming majority of the non–Georgian population (98 percent) voted in
      favor, while the vast majority of ethnic Georgians boycotted the vote.26


      The late 1980s and early 1990s saw a series of clashes in Abkhazia between ethnic
      Abkhaz and Georgians. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union and Georgian
      independence, a majority of the Abkhaz assembly in July 1992 declared de facto
      independence from Georgia. The following month, Georgian nationalist militias
      moved into Abkhazia and occupied the capital Sukhumi, burning down the Abkhaz
      national library and engaging in atrocities against Abkhaz, Russian, and Armenian
      residents.27


      In response, a loose coalition of North Caucasian forces came to the help of Abkhazia,
      together with increasing numbers of semi–covert Russian troops, and successfully
      defended the northern part of the territory. The following year, they drove the
      Georgian armed forces from Abkhazia. This campaign was in turn accompanied by
      atrocities against the ethnic Georgian population and the flight of the majority
      of Georgians.28 Today, the population of Abkhazia is around 50 percent Abkhaz,
      18 percent Armenian and nine percent Russian. A sizable ethnic Georgian minority
      of 18 percent remains, concentrated in the Gali district of southern Abkhazia.29


      The result of the war of 1992–93 was de facto Abkhaz independence and a ceasefire,
      which despite occasional clashes, has mostly lasted until the present day. For
      more than a decade, Russia continued to recognize Abkhazia as formally part of
      Georgia; but following the Georgian–Russian war of 2008, Russia drove the last
      remaining Georgian forces from the Abkhaz mountains and recognized Abkhaz independence,
      though this has not been accepted by the great majority of the international community.


      Before 2008, Russia, the United States and leading European countries made sporadic
      attempts to broker a peace settlement in Abkhazia, based on the idea of a return
      of the region to Georgia with guaranteed autonomous status. These efforts, however,
      foundered on the open opposition of the Abkhaz authorities and the covert opposition
      of Moscow, as well as the refusal of Georgian governments to allow a separate
      Abkhaz army. In the words of a Conciliation Resources report of early 2008:


      “International actors have provided modest support for initiatives designed to
      overcome isolation, build confidence or promote development without adequately
      addressing underlying concerns regarding identity and security. Indeed far more
      significant support has gone into the state-building projects of the respective
      parties — openly on the part of the U.S. and EU in regard to Georgia and covertly
      on the part of Russia in regard to Abkhazia.”30


      Any hope of agreement was blocked in part by the same factor that applied in the
      case of Nagorno–Karabakh: that Abkhaz and Russians in Abkhazia are absolutely
      unable to trust the Georgian armed forces for protection, and an international
      peacekeeping force would also be both distrusted by the Abkhaz and opposed by
      Moscow.


      In the case of Abkhazia, an additional factor is that the Georgian government
      naturally insists that any peace settlement must involve the return of all Georgian
      refugees and their descendants to Abkhazia, thereby reducing the Abkhaz again
      to a small minority — an issue that has also been a crucial obstacle to peace
      between Israel and the Palestinians, for example.31


      Conclusions


      The ethnic disputes in the southern Caucasus are extremely complex in nature,
      and extremely difficult to solve.32 These conflicts cannot simply be reduced to
      an issue of Russian domination promoting secession and conflict. Indeed, Western
      observers have always recognized this in the case of Nagorno–Karabakh, thanks
      largely to the commitment of the Armenian diaspora in the West. Lacking such diasporas,
      Abkhaz and Ossetes have seen their own views and interests overwhelmingly ignored.


      The United States has no magic formula to solve any of these conflicts. In the
      case of Nagorno–Karabakh, as described, U.S. strategy has been suspended between
      desire for closer relations with Azerbaijan and the influence of the Armenian
      diaspora in the U.S. Congress. In the case of Abkhazia and South Ossetia U.S.
      policy has in general been simply to support Georgia. This creates the likelihood
      that greater U.S. military and political involvement in the region will become
      inextricably mixed with the agenda of expelling Russia, without America being
      able to create a stable regional order of its own.


      So far, the Georgian government, unlike that of Azerbaijan, has not exploited
      Russia’s difficulties in Ukraine to launch or threaten new military offensives
      to recover its lost territories. The Georgian government is dominated by the Georgian
      Dream Party, whose leader, Bidzina Ivanishvili, has close business ties to Russia.33
      Georgia has also not introduced economic sanctions against Russia, though it voted
      in the U.N. to condemn the Russian invasion of Ukraine.


      Doubtless Georgian caution has also been shaped by the memory of Georgia’s disastrous
      defeat the last time it attempted this, and by the fact that after much pro–Georgian
      rhetoric, America did not come to Georgia’s aid. However, this restraint has led
      to considerable anger in the Georgian public, and greater U.S. engagement, especially
      if combined with fresh Russian defeats in Ukraine, could well make it impossible
      for the Georgian government not to try again; and if it continued to refuse, it
      might follow several previous post–Soviet governments in being overthrown by a
      coup or popular revolt.34


      If such a Georgian move succeeded in reconquering these territories, the result
      would almost certainly be some combination of the flight and the ethnic cleansing
      of the Ossete, Abkhaz, and Russian populations of Abkhazia and South Ossetia —
      a grave crime in itself, and one that would bring discredit on America by association,
      and strengthen those voices around the world that describe U.S. commitment to
      democracy and human rights as a hypocritical screen for U.S. aggrandizement.


      There would also, however, be a serious risk that, as in 2008, such a Georgian
      move would be defeated. Although the Georgian armed forces have been heavily armed
      and financed by the United States and NATO, the population of Georgia is barely
      one tenth that of Ukraine, while Russia is building up, through conscription,
      fresh reserves that it could divert to Georgia if necessary.


      Militarily speaking, it was open to Russia to conquer the whole of Georgia in
      August 2008, but French mediation and a Russian desire to soothe relations with
      Europe led Moscow to back off. Today, a Russian victory over Georgia would give
      the Kremlin the opportunity either to extract concessions from the West in return
      for restraint, or to humiliate America by crushing a U.S. partner. Alternatively,
      to prevent either of these scenarios, a U.S. administration might be tempted to
      intervene directly in the conflict. That, however, would bring about the scenario
      that the Biden administration has so far taken care to avoid in Ukraine: a direct
      clash between U.S. and Russian forces, with extraordinarily dangerous consequences.


      The Biden administration should continue its current policy of prudent diplomacy
      in the Caucasus, and seek to help prevent new conflicts while avoiding new entanglements.


      Neither morality nor U.S. national interests justify the United States encouraging
      this risk. Difficult though it may be for advocates of universal U.S. primacy
      to accept this, the United States has not historically possessed any important
      stake in the Caucasus at all — as it demonstrated by its having held aloof from
      regional conflicts after both the World War One and the end of the Soviet Union.
      Nor has Russia’s presence in the Caucasus over the past 30 years inflicted any
      significant damage on the United States or the U.S.–led international order. The
      Biden administration should, therefore, continue its current policy of prudent
      diplomacy in the Caucasus, and seek to help prevent new conflicts while avoiding
      new entanglements.'

    paragraph_summary: The decline of Russian military power due to its defeats in Ukraine
      poses a risk of escalating violence and instability in the Caucasus and Central
      Asia, as evidenced by renewed fighting between Azerbaijan and Armenia, which Russian
      peacekeepers have been unable to adequately manage. This shift in power may tempt
      the United States to increase its involvement in the region to diminish Russian
      influence, a move that should be avoided given that the U.S. has no vital national
      interests at stake and lacks a strategy to manage the potential fallout from new
      conflicts. The deeply rooted and complex nature of the conflicts in the southern
      Caucasus, which predate the Soviet Union, suggests that they cannot be resolved
      by external powers like the U.S. Increased support for either Georgia or Azerbaijan
      could provoke further hostilities, particularly against Armenia, which could lead
      to significant backlash domestically and regionally. Instead, the U.S. should
      maintain a limited diplomatic role focused on reducing tensions and preventing
      violence, while recognizing Russia's significant stake in the region and avoiding
      actions that could exacerbate existing conflicts.

    text: 'Executive Summary A protracted conflict in Ukraine looks increasingly plausible.
      Russia continues to launch attacks on military and civilian targets, and the United
      States and its partners are increasing shipments of arms to the Zelensky government.
      Washington is reportedly making plans to support long-term guerrilla warfare against
      Russian forces, should Kyiv fall. The current path toward a protracted war in
      Ukraine is highly undesirable and is laden with grave risks to the interests of
      the United States, Ukraine, and the international community. Such risks include:
      • a high cost in Ukrainian lives and suffering and the destruction of Ukraine
      — its infrastructure, institutions, and social fabric; • radicalization of Ukrainian
      society and a consequent civil war; • escalation to a great-power war, potentially
      involving nuclear weapons and pitting NATO against Russia, thereby threatening
      U.S. national security; • a weakening of NATO’s cohesion; • a prolonged global
      recession that strikes the U.S. as hard as it will any other nation. The United
      States and its allies should avoid these destructive outcomes by prioritizing
      support for the Ukrainian government to achieve a diplomatic settlement. Such
      a settlement will result in a more secure outcome for Ukraine, the United States,
      the European allies, and the rest of the world. While the details of such a settlement
      lie beyond this brief’s scope, the progress of Ukrainian–Russian talks indicates
      that a settlement providing for meaningful sovereignty and independence for Ukraine
      is possible. Avoiding a protracted conflict also implies that the United States
      should not adopt maximalist objectives, such as regime change in Moscow or the
      complete and decisive defeat of Russia. It should instead deploy sanctions to
      build up Ukraine’s negotiating leverage.


      The plausibility of an extended war


      Just a week into the invasion Russia launched February 24, officials in the U.S.
      and British governments warned that even though they expected Russia to achieve
      a “tactical seizure” of Kyiv and most of Ukraine within a few months at most,
      the war itself could easily last years.1


      Any continued conflict would likely not be brief. U.S. politicians and former
      government officials refer frequently to the possibility of making Ukraine “Putin’s
      Afghanistan,” indicating that many in Washington see a protracted conflict as
      a live option.


      A protracted conflict of this kind is entirely plausible. In the fourth week of
      its invasion, Russia’s drive to capture much additional territory appears to have
      stalled. But even if Kyiv eventually falls, Ukrainian forces could continue the
      war indefinitely by battling from areas of western Ukraine not occupied by the
      Russians or by supplying arms to an underground resistance to engage in an extended
      insurgency in Russian-occupied regions. For eight years, Ukrainian officials have
      made contingency plans to establish a government in Lviv, in the far west of Ukraine,
      or possibly in Poland.2 NATO allies could prolong the conflict indefinitely, if
      they so choose, by supplying such a government with weapons and matériel.


      There is ample evidence that the ground is being laid for this possibility. The
      Washington Post recently reported, “Ukraine’s allies are planning how to help
      establish and support a government-in-exile, which could direct guerrilla operations
      against Russian occupiers, according to several U.S. and European officials.”3
      Even if Russia does not occupy much of Ukraine, working through a government in
      Lviv could look somewhat similar to current operations, which provide military
      assistance to a recognized government within Ukraine. That would be a kind of
      “frozen conflict” scenario involving a long military stalemate wherein current
      hostilities continue in a divided country.


      In Russian-occupied areas of Ukraine, an internal insurgency supplied covertly
      by the U.S. and NATO appears to be a strong possibility. In a recent article in
      Foreign Affairs, Douglas London, formerly a high-ranking CIA operations officer,
      stated that “Ukrainians have spent the last eight years planning, training, and
      equipping themselves for resisting a Russian occupation…. The United States will
      invariably be a major and essential source of backing for a Ukrainian insurgency.”4
      CIA paramilitaries have been training Ukrainian forces for some time, and they
      have already fought alongside them against Russian-backed separatist forces in
      the civil war that began in the Donbas in 2014.5


      Any continued conflict would likely not be brief. U.S. politicians and former
      government officials refer frequently to the possibility of making Ukraine “Putin’s
      Afghanistan,” indicating that many in Washington see a protracted conflict as
      a live option.6


      Administration officials have also indicated that ambitious war aims may involve
      a long conflict. In March 8 testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee,
      Victoria Nuland warned that “this may just be the beginning of the fight” and
      that Ukraine could face “a long road.”7 The administration’s under secretary of
      state for political affairs also stated that the U.S. endgame was “the strategic
      defeat of President Putin” — a goal that would greatly reduce the possibility
      of face-saving compromise to end the war.


      While an unwillingness to compromise by the parties involved could force an extended
      struggle, history shows that long-term conflicts are highly destructive to the
      countries in which they are fought, carry great risk of escalation and other unpredictable
      outcomes, and are not effective in achieving key foreign policy goals. The next
      sections detail these arguments, beginning with the lessons of the Cold War period.


      The lessons of protracted conflict in the Cold War


      In the early years of the Cold War, first Moscow and then Washington abandoned
      support for proxy wars in Europe as an instrument of their rivalry. These decisions
      were crucial in precluding direct armed conflict in Europe; they eventually ended
      in the peaceful dissolution of the communist bloc and then the Soviet Union itself.
      While things were very different elsewhere, Europe was the Cold War’s crucial
      theater, involving as it did the vital interests of both sides and the likelihood
      that conventional conflict there would develop into mutual nuclear annihilation.


      In 1948, Stalin stopped supporting the Communists in Greece’s civil war and advised
      them to end their struggle. This led directly to the defeat of the Communists
      by government forces with British and U.S. backing.8 Stalin acted partly in response
      to the split between Moscow and Communist-governed Yugoslavia; but he was also
      operating in accordance with an agreement he made with Churchill in 1944, which
      left predominant influence in Greece to Britain.9 He understood that Britain and
      America would “never permit [Greece] to interrupt their lines of communication
      in the Mediterranean.”10 By this time Stalin had already given up plans for armed
      communist revolutions in France and Italy. In the background of the Soviet decision
      was the fact that, from 1945 to 1949, the United States had a monopoly of nuclear
      weapons and for years after that possessed nuclear superiority.


      Five years later, in 1953, the newly elected Eisenhower faced pressure to adopt
      a “rollback” strategy to overthrow Soviet control of Eastern Europe through local
      insurgencies backed by U.S. military power.11 His response was to convene Project
      Solarium, which examined the likely consequences of different U.S. strategies.12
      This exercise demonstrated rather convincingly that the result of a rollback would
      probably be a conventional war with the Soviet Union, with a strong likelihood
      of escalation into nuclear war.


      President Eisenhower instead opted to continue the strategy of containing the
      Soviet Union in Europe.13 This meant maintaining strong U.S. and NATO defensive
      forces and engaging in intensive anticommunist propaganda while withholding military
      support to anticommunist revolts. He stuck to this strategy three years later,
      when the Soviet army crushed the Hungarian Revolution. (We must note, however,
      that the encouragement Radio Free Europe and Voice of America had given Hungarian
      rebels led to understandable feelings of betrayal among them.)14


      The result was as George Kennan, the architect of the containment strategy, predicted.15
      It took four decades, but the Soviet bloc, Soviet communism, and the Soviet Union
      itself eventually collapsed from within as a result of the failures of its political
      and economic system. This occurred peacefully and without any risk of global war
      and nuclear annihilation. During those decades, the nations of Eastern Europe
      had to live under Communist dictatorships — but they were spared the devastation
      of a conventional war, and the annihilation of a nuclear war, and were eventually
      to emerge again as free and independent democracies.


      It was a different story beyond Europe. The United States, the Soviet Union, and
      China all supported proxy wars against each other’s client states. The result
      was horrendous suffering for the peoples of the countries concerned, severe and
      unnecessary losses and defeats for the superpowers, and sometimes unpredicted
      outcomes that were contrary to the interests of both the United States and the
      Soviet Union. It turned out that these conflicts were in the end governed by local
      dynamics that neither Moscow, Beijing, nor Washington understood or could control.16


      In Africa, U.S. support for postcolonial civil wars against governments Washington
      deemed communist meant aiding UNITA in Angola, led by Jonas Savimbi, a particularly
      cruel and ruthless warlord, against the Soviet– and Cuban-backed Popular Movement
      for the Liberation of Angola. This U.S. support took place in a de facto alliance
      with apartheid South Africa. The Angolan civil war lasted 27 years (before the
      MPLA prevailed) and cost some 800,000 lives; four million Angolans were displaced.17


      The death toll in Mozambique from its largely Cold War-driven civil war and a
      resulting famine is estimated at one million. In both countries, large numbers
      of people continue to die and lose limbs from the land mines scattered.18


      And for what? After the Soviet Union collapsed, Washington promptly abandoned
      its Angolan and Mozambican proxies and made deals with the new governments, which
      turned out not to be communists but corrupt and opportunist oligarchies with a
      veneer of progressive rhetoric. In Angola, UNITA was then defeated and Savimbi
      killed; in Mozambique, the Frelimo government waged a long war against a South
      African-backed insurgency.


      The communist great powers, of course, also made use of civil wars during the
      Cold War, with extremely mixed results. Communist ideology led Moscow to involve
      itself in local conflicts that had absolutely nothing to do with the interests
      of the Soviet Union, let alone its citizens. America’s desire for revenge for
      the Soviets’ contribution to its defeat in Indochina was one factor behind the
      United States’ support for the mujahideen insurgency against the Afghan communist
      state and its Soviet backers.


      Afghanistan in the 1980s, like Syria after 2011, demonstrates the dangers of U.S.
      support for local proxies on the basis of wider geopolitical agendas, combined
      with ignorance of the countries concerned and indifference to the fate of their
      peoples. In both cases, civil wars led to the ascendancy of extremist groups and
      criminal warlords, ethno-religious civil wars, and vicious fighting among the
      resistance groups themselves.


      In both Afghanistan and Syria, successive U.S. administrations and the CIA were
      unable to prevent U.S. money and weaponry from passing to extremist groups whose
      agendas turned out to be disastrous not only for their own countries but for America.


      In Afghanistan, U.S. aid actively favored the extremists. One of the authors of
      this paper reported on the Afghan mujahideen as a journalist in the late 1980s
      and learned to understand the truth and the utter folly of a U.S. official’s remark
      that America was right to fund and arm Islamist radical groups (rather than their
      “moderate” allies) because “they are the ones who kill Russians.”19 The rationale
      for U.S. support for the mujahideen, as set out in retrospect by Zbigniew Brzezinski,
      the Carter administration’s national security adviser, made no mention at all
      of the interests of the Afghan people or the survival of the Afghan state.20


      U.S. aid to the armed Syrian opposition (under the CIA codename Timber Sycamore)
      was the most expensive semi-clandestine operation in American history.21 Washington
      was led into it by a combination of belief in the spread of democracy in the Middle
      East, disgust at the Syrian state’s atrocities, instinctive hostility to any regime
      backed by Iran and Russia, and domestic pressure from Congress, the media, and
      nongovernmental organizations.


      This strategy was a total failure — a failure that nonetheless helped generate
      demands for a direct military American intervention. This would probably have
      become a catastrophe to exceed even that of the Iraq war if President Obama had
      not rejected these demands. The Trump administration finally wound up Timber Sycamore
      in 2017, long after it had become obviously pointless.22


      The central problem for the United States in supporting the Syrian insurgents
      was that the leading role among them was rapidly taken by Islamist extremist forces:
      first the al–Nusra Front, aligned with al–Qaeda, and then the Islamic State, ISIS.23
      A generation earlier, Washington would simply have ignored this and given them
      blanket support regardless of their ideologies and conduct; but in the wake of
      the events of September 11, 2001, and the Islamist insurgency in Iraq, this was
      no longer possible. The CIA did begin to arm groups close to al–Nusra but abandoned
      this approach when the risk of U.S. weapons being used in terrorist attacks against
      the United States became too obvious to ignore. In the end, U.S. support for the
      Syrian armed opposition was a complete failure.24


      The risks of major destruction in Ukraine


      The strongest argument for an early peace settlement that guarantees Ukrainian
      sovereignty is, of course, the atrocious suffering that this war is already causing
      to the Ukrainian people — suffering that can get only worse the longer the war
      goes on.


      Two strategies are open to the Russian government and military if the war continues.
      The first would be to try to capture more key Ukrainian cities in the east and
      south. It would no longer seek to conquer the whole of Ukraine and replace the
      Ukrainian government with a Russian client government; the objective would be
      to strengthen its hand at the negotiating table and add to the already considerable
      economic pressure on Ukraine. This could involve, for example, trying to capture
      the whole of Ukraine’s Black Sea coastline.


      Initially, the Kremlin and the Russian military apparently hoped to capture Ukrainian
      cities easily and with minimal civilian casualties. They soon realized that this
      was impossible. The Russian army has since reverted to the traditional urban-warfare
      tactics employed in Grozny in the two Chechen wars and in World War II, and by
      the United States in Vietnam and Korea: using massive firepower to blast the defenders
      from their positions and spare casualties among the attacking troops.25 The inevitable
      result of this is massive destruction and huge casualties among civilians unable
      to flee. This was the strategy adopted by Russia in its assault on Mariupol, which
      has led to many civilian dead.26 If the war goes on, we can expect the same to
      happen to one Ukrainian city after another. The overall cost will be far greater
      than even the devastation in Mariupol. That city had a peacetime population of
      less than a half a million; Odessa and Kyiv have populations of close to one million
      and three million respectively.


      The strongest argument for an early peace settlement that guarantees Ukrainian
      sovereignty is, of course, the atrocious suffering that this war is already causing
      to the Ukrainian people — suffering that can get only worse the longer the war
      goes on.


      Alternatively, if the Kremlin and the Russian high command determine that destroying
      Ukrainian cities one by one will cost too many Russian dead and risk intensified
      antiwar protests at home, Russia could stop at a defensible line (incorporating
      the whole of the Donbas provinces and a land bridge from Russia to Crimea) and
      challenge the Ukrainians to counterattack. Russia might even offer a unilateral
      ceasefire at that point. This would force the Ukrainian government and military
      either to live with the indefinite loss of much larger territories, or to attack
      Russian forces in an effort to drive them out.


      In this case, the balance of military advantage would shift to the defenders,
      and Ukraine should expect massive casualties among its own forces. Russia would
      also undoubtedly continue to bombard key Ukrainian infrastructure. The eight-year
      war in the Donbas, which was fought to a bloody stalemate with some 15,000 casualties,
      gives a hint of what such a conflict might look like. A divided Ukraine could
      easily result in a kind of supersized version of the Donbas conflict, with far
      more casualties and greater disruption to the region. In addition, if Ukraine
      were seen to be pursuing such a war with unrealistic goals and at the behest of
      the United States, after a Russian ceasefire offer, parts of international public
      opinion might shift away from Ukraine and the West.


      The risks of extremism and radicalization


      The other development that should concern us in a protracted war is the likelihood
      that it will strengthen extremist forces in Ukraine. These are forces that will
      reliably defend Ukraine against Russia but could dangerously impede Ukraine’s
      progress toward joining the West as a fully fledged liberal democracy.


      This concern focuses on radical, ethno-nationalist forces of which the most important
      are the Svoboda (“Freedom”) political party (formerly the Social National Party),
      the Right Sector political group, and the Azov paramilitary units formed in May
      2014 to fight pro–Russian separatists in the Donbas.27 These groups trace their
      descent from the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists, OUN, and its military
      wing, the Ukrainian Insurgent Army, UPA, which were active during and after World
      War II.28


      This force intermittently collaborated with the Nazi occupation of Ukraine and
      carried out massacres of Poles, Jews, and Soviet partisans and their supporters
      among ethnic Russians and Russian-speaking Ukrainians.29 Encouraged by decades
      of Soviet propaganda, this has left a strong legacy of distrust of Ukrainian ethnic
      nationalism in much of eastern and southern Ukraine.


      OUN–UPA’s ideology was extreme ethnic-nationalist and authoritarian, with affinities
      for the Nazi Führerprinzip, absolute loyalty to charismatic dictators. This group
      carried on an insurgency against the Soviet Union from 1944 to the early 1950s;
      it was eventually crushed with heavy losses.30


      Russian propaganda has colossally exaggerated the contemporary strength of Ukrainian
      extreme nationalist groups in support of the Kremlin’s stated condition that Ukraine
      be “denazified” as part of any peace agreement.31 Because these groups have been
      integrated into the Ukrainian National Guard yet retain their autonomous identities
      and command structures, over the course of an extended war they could amass a
      formidable fifth column that would radicalize Ukraine’s postwar political dynamic.


      Electoral support for these groups has so far been very weak. Right Sector has
      elected only one member to parliament. Svoboda achieved the pinnacle of its success
      in the 2012 parliamentary elections, with 10.44 percent of the vote. By 2019,
      however, this had shrunk to 2.15 percent, concentrated in the far west of the
      country.32 On the other hand, the extreme nationalist paramilitaries are very
      much the kind of force that gains in power as part of a war involving not only
      state forces but independent paramilitary volunteers.


      Their influence is now disproportionate to their limited popular support for two
      reasons. The first is their ability to put pressure on Ukrainian governments and
      parliaments by mobilizing sometimes violent demonstrations in Kyiv.33 This was
      evident in their leading role in the Maidan demonstrations of 2014, which brought
      down the government of Viktor Yanukovych, and in which a number of Svoboda and
      Right Sector members were killed.34 On May 2, 2014, Right Sector activists together
      with nationalist soccer hooligans fought against pro–Russian protesters in Odessa,
      leading to the deaths of 46 of the latter when Ukrainian nationalists set fire
      to the trade union building they had occupied.35


      The second explanation for the outsized influence of these groups is the central
      role the Azov regiment and Right Sector forces (both of which were incorporated
      in the Ukrainian National Guard in September 2014) have played in the fight against
      separatist forces and their Russian backers in the Donbas.36 This included a key
      part played by Azov in the defense of Mariupol against Russian-backed forces.
      Since then, Azov has had a dominant security role in Mariupol, which they have
      defended with great courage and grit in the present war.37


      Their role in the Ukrainian armed forces reportedly increased dramatically in
      early 2022, as Ukraine prepared to defend itself against Russian invasion.38 Their
      fighting reputation gives these groups the chance to recruit from beyond their
      own narrow ideological base. According to Andreas Umland, an expert on the Ukrainian
      extreme right,


      People sign up because these are the tough guys… If you’re going to fight a war,
      who is going to fight it? For war, you need a certain type of people. The people
      who are willing to do that are the ultranationalists.39


      These groups have been widely criticized by Western politicians and in the media
      for their antisemitism, racism, white supremacism (with close links to such groups
      in the West), antifeminism, anti–LGBTQI ideology, and fascistic antecedents and
      symbols.40 They have frequently taken part in violent attacks on political opponents
      and demonstrations of which they disapprove and have actively intimidated allegedly
      pro–Russian political parties and journalists.41


      In 2018 Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International, and Freedom House wrote to
      the Ukrainian government criticizing it for not doing more to stop these groups’
      hate crimes and warning that the Ukrainian state risked losing a monopoly on armed
      force in the country.42 A report from the office of the United Nations Commissioner
      for Human Rights has accused Azov (as well as the Russian-backed separatists)
      of carrying out atrocities in the disputed Donbas region.43 In another worrying
      sign for any future insurgency, Right Sector has been widely accused of links
      to organized crime and of recruiting among soccer hooligans and other youth gangs.44


      There is concern in the U.S. Congress about Azov and other extreme nationalist
      paramilitary groups receiving arms and training as part of NATO military assistance
      to Ukraine.45 In 2018, an amendment by the U.S. House of Representatives banned
      Azov from receiving U.S. military assistance.46 Representative Ro Khanna, California
      Democrat, stated:


      White supremacy and neo–Nazism are unacceptable and have no place in our world…
      I am very pleased that the recently passed omnibus prevents the U.S. from providing
      arms and training assistance to the neo–Nazi Azov Battalion fighting in Ukraine.


      Despite these representations, however, subsequent evidence suggests that Azov
      continued to receive Western weaponry.47


      Should these forces ever gain the ascendancy in Ukraine, this would create immense
      problems for a country that hopes eventually to join the European Union. It should
      be noted in this connection that as Svoboda’s party program announces, it is a
      national revolutionary movement.48 If it should gain the military leadership in
      an anti–Russian insurgency, it seems quite possible that (like the Communist resistance
      movements in World War II) it would then try to use this as the basis for seizing
      control of the state and transforming Ukraine in accordance with its ideology
      — with how much success we cannot of course say.


      Should [far right] forces ever gain the ascendancy in Ukraine, this would create
      immense problems for a country that hopes eventually to join the European Union.


      Moreover, the longer the war goes on the greater will be the postwar problem of
      young, brutalized, and unemployed Ukrainian military veterans making their way
      into radical political parties and their paramilitary wings. This same issue haunted
      Europe after World War I and played a key part in the rise of Fascism; it also
      haunted Chechnya after the war of 1994–96 and helped generate support for Islamist
      extremism there.


      The rise of far-right militias could also play straight into Moscow’s hands. Many
      extreme ethno-nationalists detest not only the Russian state but the ethnic Russian
      minority in Ukraine; they often regard Russian-speaking Ukrainians as actual or
      potential traitors. As a Ukrainian nationalist official of Prosvita, a cultural
      organization, told one of the authors,


      In the Ukrainian genocide and all their other crimes, the Communists always carried
      out a policy based on great Russian chauvinism and the great-power ambitions of
      the Russian people…. Worst of all is that Russian rule and Russian immigration
      has damaged our genotype. Everything that you see here — lack of order, dirty
      toilets — is the result of racial assimilation. Because once a man has been drawn
      away from his ethnos, his traditions, his language, he can no longer behave decently
      in any way or find a decent place in the world.49


      All armed resistance movements prove willing to kill not only the troops and officials
      of an occupying power but also of their local collaborators — and often their
      families, too. This can easily combine with banditry. And as noted, in ethnically
      divided societies, insurgencies have a strong tendency to increase local ethnic
      fears and hatreds.


      Since Russia’s invasion in February 2022, the destruction and civilian loss of
      life inflicted on urban populations in the eastern and southern areas of the country
      seems to have eliminated whatever pro–Russian feeling remained. Reflecting this,
      even ethnically Russian mayors and other elected officials have often rallied
      their populations to resist — and in towns occupied by Russian forces they have
      been arrested in consequence.50 This has not only destroyed the moral basis for
      the Russian invasion and discredited the attendant propaganda; it will also make
      it virtually impossible for Russia to create any kind of stable administration
      in the areas it occupies. This is a change in the traditional political culture
      of these regions that is of the greatest potential importance for Ukraine’s future.


      The only factor that could drive these Russian and Russian-speaking populations
      back into support for and dependence on Russia would be if the Azov Battalion
      and other extreme nationalist paramilitaries were seen as spearheading Ukrainian
      forces — and in consequence these forces were seen as directed not just against
      the Russian military but against the Russian–Ukrainian minority.


      It is entirely possible that the end result of a war waged along these lines would
      be not a complete Russian withdrawal from Ukraine, but the permanent partition
      of Ukraine along ethno-linguistic lines. It is thus essential that the United
      States stand for a civic version of Ukrainian identity — in accordance with American
      ideals and for the sake of Ukraine itself. The longer a war goes on, the deeper
      these ethnic divisions and the associated radicalization are liable to become.


      The risks of escalation to wider war


      The Russian army’s lack of progress in the first month of its campaign implies
      a war of attrition in which the frontlines move slowly and Ukraine retains a semi-functioning
      government and army for an extended period. Conversely, the Russian army could
      make steady, albeit slow progress over the next few months to gain effective control
      of eastern Ukraine. In the latter case, a Ukrainian insurgency, armed and trained
      at bases in NATO states, emerges as a distinct possibility, as previously noted.
      Both of these scenarios open the door to a protracted conflict.


      There has been informed speculation as to the Ukraine conflict’s escalation to
      the nuclear plane.51 But the dangers of conventional escalation are probably higher.
      Emma Ashford and Joshua Shifrinson write in Foreign Affairs of an “insecurity
      spiral” gathering pace in the conflict, with multiple paths for escalation that
      would draw in NATO states.52 Ashford and Shifrinson list Russian attacks on supply
      convoys laden with NATO–supplied weapons and matériel, risky actions by U.S. allies
      such as Poland or the Baltic states, and spillover into cyberwarfare.


      The first of these — Russian attacks on NATO supplies — is already in prospect.
      As American and allied weapons are rapidly mobilized to aid Ukraine, supply lines
      have emerged that run from border states such as Poland and Slovakia into eastern
      and central Ukraine. Enhanced Ukrainian resistance, fueled in part by these arms
      deliveries, could further slow the Russian advance. This creates an incentive
      for Moscow to attack these supply convoys. Indeed, Russia has already made a point
      of threatening such action. The Russian military carried out its first major attack
      close to NATO borders on March 12, 2022, when about 30 cruise missiles struck
      a major base used for training foreign fighters.53


      Russia could continue to confine any future attacks on supply convoys within Ukrainian
      territory, but targets just across the border in countries such as Poland and
      Romania may also be hit, intentionally or inadvertently. Technically, this would
      be an attack on the sovereign territories of these states, and NATO could invoke
      Article V of its charter, the mutual-assistance clause, to retaliate against Russian
      troops.


      If the conflict metastasizes to an insurgency, it may be even harder to end. Insurgencies
      often go on for long periods of time if they begin with at least a degree of popular
      support. The median length of insurgencies is about 10 years, according to a RAND
      study, and many have gone on for much longer.54 Good examples are the Tamil insurgents
      in Sri Lanka, who fought the Sinhalese-dominated government for nearly three decades,
      and the FARC in Colombia, which was active for five decades. Support from an external
      state is a major factor in maintaining an insurgency. If the external state withdraws
      such sponsorship, the insurgency is typically dealt a major blow. This implies
      that U.S. or NATO states’ support for any future Ukrainian insurgency will be
      a key factor for its continuance in the longer run.


      The long temporal horizon of a protracted conflict also presents major risks of
      escalation. Even if Russia confines its attacks on supply lines and arms deliveries
      to those within Ukrainian borders, the chances of inadvertent strikes into NATO
      territory or “hot pursuit”–type incidents, in which Russian troops or aircraft
      cross the border into Poland or another NATO member, greatly increase under these
      conditions. This risk would be much lower in the case of a shorter conflict that
      is brought to an end early through a negotiated compromise.


      Other risks of escalation are also enhanced through the conflict’s long duration.
      One pathway is through a major NATO buildup in vulnerable areas close to its defense
      perimeter. The best example of these is the Suwalki Gap, a thin corridor of Polish
      and Lithuanian territory that separates the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad from
      Russian territory and Russia’s ally Belarus.55 Though NATO may do this from a
      defensive standpoint, it can trigger a counter-buildup by Russian troops, leading
      to potential clashes through accident or misinterpretation.


      The risks to the cohesion of NATO


      In the wake of the Russian invasion, there was a tremendous surge of support for
      an embattled Ukraine among almost all NATO states. Even normally pro–Russian Hungary
      signaled a distancing from Russia. However, as the weeks have gone by, the stresses
      of the war have revealed significant differences within the alliance as to the
      extent of military support for Ukraine. When the Biden administration blocked
      Poland’s push to supply MiG–29 combat aircraft to Ukraine (in exchange for American
      F–16s), mixed messaging and different priorities led to a temporary rift between
      Warsaw and Washington.56 Poland and the U.S. have also differed strongly on the
      former’s suggestion of a NATO “peacekeeping force” to be deployed in Ukraine.57


      More enduring differences could emerge if the war turns into a protracted conflict.
      Anti–Russian nationalism has been a strong factor in the politics of Poland and
      the Baltic states for many years. The influx of millions of Ukrainian refugees
      into Poland, Romania, and other Central European states can also add to a strong
      desire to intervene in risky ways in the hope of decisively defeating Russia.


      These factors encourage riskier attitudes in some of these states when it comes
      to responding to the Russian invasion. For instance, Poland has openly backed
      a no-fly zone in Ukraine.58 A no-fly zone would need to be enforced in contested
      skies over Ukraine by attacking Russian air defense and aircraft in the skies
      — in other words, a NATO–Russia war. Rifts such as those noted here could grow
      if the conflict stretches out, putting the alliance under strain.


      There is currently tremendous goodwill in Central Europe toward the millions of
      Ukrainian refugees who have arrived mostly in the border states of Poland, Slovakia,
      Romania, and Hungary.59 But in a prolonged conflict, tensions will likely grow
      between Western and Central Europe as to how these arrivals should be settled
      across Europe, an echo of the earlier acrimony between Greece and Italy on one
      hand and the U.K., Germany, and other states over housing refugees from the Syria
      and Libya conflicts.60


      The risks of a prolonged economic recession


      If the war and the most severe Western economic sanctions last only a short period
      of time, the wider economic effects of the Ukraine crisis will be limited.61 Economists
      warn, however, that a prolonged conflict accompanied by intense sanctions risks
      triggering a global recession.62


      These recessionary effects will be threefold. First, a steep reduction in Ukrainian
      and Russian wheat and other food exports will drive a rise in global food prices.
      This will badly damage the wellbeing of the world’s poorest and most vulnerable
      populations. It would be very likely to trigger unrest and increase extremism
      in poorer countries dependent on wheat imports, including in the Middle East and
      North Africa.63 The resulting instability could worsen the global economic and
      financial climate. International financial markets and confidence will also be
      affected if Russia defaults on its international debt of some $480 billion.64


      Economists warn that a prolonged conflict accompanied by intense sanctions risks
      triggering a global recession.


      Second, when combined with the rise in energy prices due to the volatility in
      energy markets caused by the war and sanctions, these commodity shortages would
      increase inflationary pressures, especially in the United States, where inflation
      has already risen sharply in recent months.65 As families spend more on food and
      fuel, their spending on other things will drop.


      Finally, if the West were to extend secondary sanctions to China in an effort
      completely to isolate Russia and in response to continued Chinese trade with Russia,
      as administration officials have threatened in recent encounters with Chinese
      counterparts, then the entire global trading system will be disrupted, with extremely
      unpredictable but potentially disastrous consequences.66


      Conclusions


      It is urgently necessary that the Biden administration and the U.S. Congress give
      their full support to a peace process that will bring about an early end to the
      war on terms that will safeguard Ukrainian sovereignty and independence.


      The idea is circulating in U.S. policy circles that Washington should in effect
      obstruct efforts to achieve a diplomatic settlement and encourage a protracted
      war to “bleed” and weaken Russia, overthrow the Putin regime, and isolate China.67
      This would cause great harm to innocents and would be contrary to the interests
      of the United States and the international community. It would repeat the worst
      aspects of U.S. behavior during the Cold War, when it sought geopolitical gain
      at the expense of the lives of other peoples. A protracted conflict would help
      inflict deep and unending suffering and death on the people of Ukraine, for American
      goals that have nothing to do with their interests or those of their country.


      A prolonged war would present a grave and permanent risk of the war spreading,
      especially if Russia were tempted to attack NATO countries responsible for supplying
      arms to Ukraine. The impact of the war and sanctions on European economies would
      increase the danger of a rift in the Western alliance, especially if the continuation
      of the war were seen widely as due to Ukrainian intransigence encouraged by the
      United States. A protracted war would also risk strengthening and empowering radical
      ethno-nationalist groups that, in the postwar period, might prove a threat to
      liberal democracy in Ukraine and an obstacle to Ukraine joining the European Union.


      The United States should do its utmost to prevent a protracted conflict in Ukraine,
      as well as to promote an early settlement on terms that will safeguard Ukrainian
      sovereignty, independence, and peace.


      Some proponents of discouraging or blocking diplomatic negotiations maintain that
      rigorous, extensive sanctions can bring down the Putin regime and should not be
      lifted prematurely in a diplomatic give-and-take. However, sanctions as a regime-change
      tool have historically tended to strengthen the regimes they are intended to destroy,
      both by increasing nationalist sentiment in the affected populations and by allowing
      the regimes concerned to tighten their grip on their economies. If they remain
      in place for long, the sanctions imposed on Russia and the war itself risk severe
      damage to the world economy and severe economic harm to U.S. citizens and to America’s
      global interests. There is a significant risk of economic recession, starting
      in Europe but spreading to the United States and the rest of the world.68 The
      World Food Program and the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization are already
      issuing dire warnings of the consequences of a steep rise in wheat prices for
      poor nations and vulnerable populations.69


      Finally, barring the complete collapse of the Russian state as occurred 30 years
      ago, it is highly unlikely that a protracted war will bring Ukraine significantly
      better terms than those now possible. Both sides are going to have to accept painful
      compromises — all of which will become even more difficult to achieve if the conflict
      is allowed to continue.


      For all these reasons, the United States should do its utmost to prevent a protracted
      conflict in Ukraine, as well as to promote an early settlement on terms that will
      safeguard Ukrainian sovereignty, independence, and peace.

    one_sentence_summary: The article warns that a protracted conflict in Ukraine is
      increasingly likely due to ongoing Russian aggression and U.S. support for guerrilla
      warfare, which could lead to severe humanitarian, geopolitical, and economic consequences,
      and advocates for prioritizing diplomatic solutions to avoid these destructive
      outcomes.
    paragraph_summary: The article discusses the increasing likelihood of a protracted
      conflict in Ukraine as Russia continues its military aggression, while the U.S.
      and its allies ramp up arms shipments to support the Ukrainian government. This
      ongoing war poses significant risks, including immense loss of life, potential
      civil unrest in Ukraine, escalation into a broader conflict involving NATO and
      Russia, weakened NATO cohesion, and a global recession affecting all nations.
      The authors argue that a diplomatic settlement is crucial to avoid these destructive
      outcomes, emphasizing the need for the U.S. to adopt realistic objectives rather
      than pursuing regime change in Russia. Historical lessons from the Cold War illustrate
      the dangers of prolonged conflicts, which often lead to severe humanitarian crises
      and unintended consequences. The article warns that a drawn-out war could empower
      extremist groups within Ukraine, complicating its path toward democracy and stability.
      Ultimately, the authors advocate for prioritizing a peace settlement that ensures
      Ukrainian sovereignty to mitigate further suffering and destruction.
