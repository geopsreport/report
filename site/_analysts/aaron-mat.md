summary: |
  Amid ongoing debates over US foreign policy and intelligence credibility, newly declassified documents have cast fresh doubt on the longstanding narrative of Russian interference in the 2016 US election. As **Aaron Maté** reports, these documents reveal that senior officials at the NSA and FBI held only "low confidence" in the claim that Russia hacked and leaked Democratic Party materials to benefit Donald Trump. This contradicts the previously accepted consensus and suggests that the Obama administration may have overstated the evidence to undermine Trump. **Tulsi Gabbard**, former Director of National Intelligence under Trump, argues that intelligence was manipulated for political ends, further fueling skepticism about the official Russiagate story.
  
  This revelation comes as the US continues to grapple with the legacy of the Mueller investigation and subsequent probes, including Special Counsel John Durham’s inquiry, which, according to **Maté**, failed to deliver meaningful accountability or transparency regarding the origins of the Russiagate narrative. The persistence of these doubts is likely to deepen partisan divides and erode public trust in US intelligence assessments—a trend that is "quite likely" to influence both domestic politics and future foreign policy decisions.
  
  On the international front, the US posture toward Russia and Ukraine remains in flux. Despite initial expectations of a more aggressive stance under Trump, recent policy moves have fallen short of hawkish hopes. **Senator Lindsey Graham** had touted the possibility of "the most impactful sanction package in US history" and a surge in weapons for Ukraine, but the actual measures announced by Trump were far less transformative. European officials now perceive Trump as distancing himself from the Ukraine conflict, signaling that the US may reduce its direct involvement and leave the war largely in European hands.
  
  Looking ahead, the majority of analysts cited by **Maté** agree that the US is unlikely to escalate its engagement in Ukraine in the near term, and that the credibility crisis surrounding intelligence on Russia will persist. There is a "high chance" that these developments will embolden critics of US foreign policy and further complicate efforts to build international coalitions on issues involving Russia. The ongoing reassessment of intelligence practices is expected to remain a central issue in Washington, with little prospect for swift resolution.

    text: '(Photo by Mark Wilson/Getty Images) Although Robert Mueller failed to find
      an election conspiracy between Donald Trump and Moscow, the former Special Counsel
      threw a lifeline to the Russiagate narrative by alleging that the Kremlin had
      engaged in a “sweeping and systematic” effort to get Trump elected and “sow discord”
      among Americans. Six years later, that questionable but enduring claim continues
      to unravel. According to newly declassified documents, U.S. intelligence leaders
      concealed high-level doubts about one of Russiagate’s foundational allegations:
      that Russia stole and leaked Democratic Party material to help Trump defeat Hillary
      Clinton. In a September 2016 report that was never made public until now, the
      NSA and the FBI broke with their intelligence counterparts and expressed “low
      confidence” in the attribution to Russia. The previously undisclosed dissent about
      Russia’s alleged hacking activities in the 2016 election is among several revelations
      released last week by Tulsi Gabbard, Trump’s Director of National Intelligence.
      In Gabbard’s view , President Obama and senior members of his cabinet “manufactured
      and politicized intelligence” in its waning months to wage “a years-long coup
      against President Trump.” Gabbard’s material adds to a body of evidence that challenges
      the widely parroted claim about the quality of evidence and the extent of Russian
      “interference operations” in the 2016 election. These conclusions – based on questionable
      assertions presented as hard facts – have been falsely portrayed as an intelligence
      consensus. When Trump, the nation’s commander-in-chief, cast doubt on the Russian
      interference allegations in a July 2018 news conference, former CIA chief John
      Brennan denounced him as “nothing short of treasonous.” It turns out that Trump
      was not out of sync with the U.S. intelligence community he was accused of betraying.
      Subscribe now “Low Confidence” in Core Allegation Until now, the purported U.S.
      intelligence consensus on Russian meddling has been conveyed to the public in
      three seminal reports. The first was a January 2017 intelligence community assessment
      (ICA) released in the final days of the Obama administration under the direction
      of Brennan and then-Director of National Intelligence James Clapper. The ICA accused
      Russian President Vladimir Putin of ordering an “influence campaign” to “denigrate”
      Democratic candidate Clinton and “help” Trump win the 2016 election. Some of this
      effort involved propaganda on Russian media outlets and messaging on social media.
      The larger component hinged on the allegation that the GRU, Russia’s main intelligence
      agency, stole emails and documents from the Democratic Party and released that
      material principally via two online entities, DCLeaks and Guccifer 2.0, as well
      as the whistleblower organization WikiLeaks. Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks,
      has long denied that Russia or any other state actor was his source. Nevertheless,
      the January 2017 ICA stated that U.S. intelligence had “high confidence” that
      Russia engineered the hack. The Mueller report , issued more than two years later,
      advanced the ICA’s claims with even more confidence and specificity . A bipartisan
      Senate intelligence review, released in August 2020 , endorsed the ICA and Mueller
      reports and was widely treated as a vindication of the conduct of the intelligence
      officials behind them. The documents newly declassified by Gabbard show that the
      ICA, Mueller, and Senate reports all excluded the intelligence community’s own
      secretly identified doubts and evidentiary gaps on the core allegation of Russian
      meddling. In a previously unpublished Intelligence Community Assessment circulated
      within the government on Sept. 12, 2016 (hereafter “September ICA”), the FBI and
      NSA expressed “low confidence” that Russia was behind the hack and release of
      Democratic Party emails. U.S. intelligence agencies, the report explained, “lack
      sufficient technical details” to link the stolen Democratic Party material released
      by WikiLeaks and other sources “to Russian state-sponsored actors.” Sept. 12,
      2016: A suppressed “low confidence” dissent on Russiagate’s core allegation The
      joint FBI-NSA dissent was especially significant given their central role in investigating
      Russia’s alleged cyber meddling. With its sweeping foreign surveillance capability,
      the NSA is the agency best positioned to assess the source of the alleged hacking
      of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and Democratic Congressional Campaign
      Committee (DCCC). Meanwhile, the FBI took the lead in probing the cyber-theft
      and release of stolen material from the Democratic Party networks. The private
      acknowledgment that these two agencies did not have the “technical” data to link
      the hacking to Russia bolsters longstanding criticism, overlooked by legacy media,
      that the “Russian interference” allegations lacked supporting evidence. Contrary
      to subsequent assertions, the September ICA shows that the U.S. intelligence community
      had no hard evidence that Putin ordered the theft of Democratic Party material
      as part of an influence campaign to help Trump. “ If the disclosures of the DNC
      and DCCC documents were indeed orchestrated by the Russian intelligence services,”
      the report stated, “those services would very likely have sought Putin’s approval
      for the operation.” This passage indicates that U.S. intelligence declined to
      endorse assertions promoted by Brennan and leaked to the media during Trump’s
      first term, that a highly placed Kremlin mole captured Putin’s orders to meddle
      in the 2016 election in support of Trump. The alleged mole was later identified
      as a mid-level Kremlin official named Oleg Smolenkov , who left Russia to live
      in the Virginia suburbs under his own name. President Obama Pushes Narrative Rather
      than make the September ICA and its dissenting contents public, the Obama administration
      told a much different story, one that ensured that allegations of “Russian interference”
      would hobble Trump’s presidency even before he took office. On Oct. 7, 2016, the
      Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Office of the Director of National
      Intelligence (ODNI) issued a joint statement claiming that the “U.S. Intelligence
      Community is confident” that Russia hacked the Democratic Party in order to “interfere
      with the U.S. election process.” No mention was made of the NSA and FBI’s shared
      “low confidence” in that allegation, or their lack of technical evidence for it.
      Notably, the FBI objected to formally accusing Russia and refused to participate
      . But by that point, the joint statement had a more powerful endorser. According
      to testimony from Jeh Johnson, who then served as DHS secretary, President Obama
      “approved the statement” and “wanted us to make [it].” On December 6, 2016, Obama
      made another request, asking the intelligence community to produce a new version
      of the ICA that could be made public. As Real Clear Investigations previously
      reported , and a recent CIA review has newly confirmed , that version of the ICA
      – released in January 2017 and hereafter referred to as the “January ICA” – was
      tainted by a hurried production schedule and the exclusion of key intelligence
      agencies under the close control of Brennan and Clapper. Apart from references
      to the Steele dossier – now debunked opposition research financed by Hillary Clinton’s
      campaign alleging a Trump/Russia conspiracy – it contained no new evidence that
      would have reversed the previous assessments. After ordering a replacement ICA,
      Obama administration officials moved to silence dissent. According to Gabbard
      ’s Office of the Director of National Intelligence, a senior official who “led”
      the September ICA on allegations of Russian meddling was “sidelined” from the
      new process. This unidentified official, whom Gabbard’s office describes as the
      “ODNI Whistleblower,” was shunned after “questioning his leadership about why
      an IC assessment was being created that contradicted multiple IC assessments.”
      The ODNI whistleblower also asserts that he was later pressured to accept unsupported
      findings in the January ICA, “including that the Russian government had a preference
      for President Trump.” Speculation Accepted as Fact Meanwhile, in a newly disclosed
      Dec. 7 memo written one day after Obama’s ICA tasking, the Office of the Director
      of National Intelligence acknowledged that the confidence level about alleged
      Russian hacking had barely changed. The document claimed to have “high confidence”
      that Russia had, in 2015 and 2016, hacked into networks belonging to the Democratic
      National Committee and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. But when
      it came to whether this Russian hacking actually led to exfiltration, dissemination,
      and public release to actors like WikiLeaks, the document used qualified, tepid
      language that reflected continued uncertainty. “ Most IC agencies,” the DNI wrote,
      only had “ moderate confidence that Russian services probably orchestrated at
      least some of the disclosures” of stolen Democratic Party material (emphasis added).
      The Dec. 7 DNI memo also inadvertently confirmed another evidentiary gap: a reliance
      on evidence provided by Trump’s campaign rival. The “attribution of the intrusions”
      to Russia, the DNI wrote, was “based on the forensic evidence identified by a
      private cyber-firm and the IC’s review and understanding of cyber activities by
      the Russian Government.” That private cyber-firm is CrowdStrike, which worked
      directly for the Clinton campaign, and which had triggered Russiagate the previous
      June by accusing Russia of hacking the DNC servers. As RCI previously reported
      , despite the high stakes involved, the FBI acceded to the DNC’s refusal to let
      the bureau independently analyze its server, deferring instead to CrowdStrike’s
      analysis. The timing of the FBI’s “low confidence” assessment suggests that it
      did not find CrowdStrike’s initial attribution to Russia convincing. CrowdStrike
      submitted its third and final report to the FBI on Aug. 24, three weeks before
      the September ICA recorded the FBI and NSA’s dissent on the Russian hacking allegation.
      Dec. 7th 2016: Still only “moderate confidence” in the Russian hack and leak allegation,
      and a confirmed reliance on the “forensic evidence” of Clinton contractor CrowdStrike.
      The DNI’s reliance on the forensics of a firm working for Trump’s political opponent
      – just as the FBI simultaneously relied on the Clinton-funded Steele dossier in
      its fruitless hunt for collusion – was kept under wraps. And as RCI previously
      reported , so was another critical disclosure made in closed-door congressional
      testimony one year later. In December 2017, CrowdStrike President Shawn Henry
      testified that his firm “did not have concrete evidence” that Russian hackers
      had exfiltrated data from the DNC servers. He said there were signs of potential
      Russian malware on the servers, but no evidence that any information had been
      uploaded by them. Put another way, they might have had keys to the servers, but
      there was no proof that they had removed any content. Henry’s admission to the
      House Intelligence Committee was also kept from the public throughout the Mueller
      probe. For unspecified reasons, the FBI again declined to endorse the intelligence
      assessment on alleged Russian meddling. On Dec. 8, one day after the DNI memo
      was circulated, an FBI official replied that the bureau was “drafting a dissent,”
      and asked that the ODNI “remove our seal [and] annotations of co-authorship.”
      In response, an ODNI official opined that the FBI’s “only difference” with the
      Dec. 7 memo “was over confidence level on the attribution.” The ODNI official
      also pointed out that the FBI’s disagreement was with “I&A.” This was a reference
      to the Office of Intelligence and Analysis at DHS, which had co-authored, along
      with the Clapper-run ODNI, the Oct. 7 statement that the FBI had refused to endorse,
      and that falsely claimed to speak on behalf of the “U.S. Intelligence Community.”
      The FBI’s continued dissent underscores that, by the time Obama had ordered the
      production of a new ICA, the intelligence community still had not reached consensus
      on the attribution of the email hacking to Russia. Despite the lingering divisions
      over the evidence for alleged Russian hacking, a meeting between President Obama
      and top principals just one day later claimed to have reached a united front.
      On Dec. 9, Obama huddled with top national security officials, including Clapper
      and Brennan, at the White House. Notably, the two agencies that had previously
      dissented on Russian hacking – the FBI and NSA – were not represented by their
      respective leaders, James Comey and Mike Rogers, but instead by deputies Andrew
      McCabe and Richard Ledgett. According to a newly declassified summary of that
      meeting, the Principals Committee resolved to “publicly release and attribute
      to Russian intelligence services technical and other information ... in intelligence
      reporting” from that same day. It is unclear why Obama and his principals suddenly
      felt confident publicly attributing the Democratic Party hack to Russia when the
      FBI and NSA had expressed "low confidence" in that judgment based on a lack of
      technical evidence. Dec. 9th 2016: Despite high-level dissent, President Obama
      and senior officials decide to “attribute” the DNC hack and release to “Russian
      intelligence services.” Spreading the False Narrative As Obama and senior intelligence
      officials concealed the community’s doubts about the alleged Russian hack and
      releases, as well as their reliance on a Clinton campaign contractor to investigate
      it, more false claims were leaked to the public. Two days after the DNI’s Dec.
      7 memo, the Washington Post published a story claiming that a “secret assessment”
      from the CIA had concluded that the hacking of Democratic Party emails was “part
      of a wider Russian operation to boost Trump and hurt Clinton''s chances” in the
      2016 election. A senior U.S. official told the Post that it was “the assessment
      of the intelligence community” that Russia sought “to help Trump get elected.
      That’s the consensus view.” In fact, there had been no such assessment or consensus,
      only strong doubts about the hacking allegation at the heart of the purported
      “Russian operation.” Rather than refute the erroneous Post story, the Obama administration
      continued to promote its unsupported narrative. Three weeks later, on Dec. 29,
      the Department of Homeland Security, this time joined by the FBI, issued a report
      that newly promoted the allegation of Russian email theft. Without mentioning
      the IC’s low-to-moderate confidence in Russian hacking or the integral role of
      Clinton contractor CrowdStrike, the joint report described the alleged Russian
      hacking effort as “likely leading to the exfiltration of information” from Democratic
      Party networks. It is unclear how the FBI arrived at this conclusion after voicing
      at least two previous dissents. This pattern, where privately identified evidentiary
      holes were later supplanted by publicly confident assertions, was repeated time
      and time again to advance the Russia narrative. After burying dissenting opinions
      on Russian meddling and leaking false claims to the media, Obama administration
      and intelligence officials released a newly sanitized version of the ICA on Jan.
      6, 2017. Two other versions of that document with higher levels of classification
      were produced, one of which – a “downgraded” product below the highest-level classified
      one, hereafter referred to as the Downgraded ICA – has been newly released by
      Gabbard. The Downgraded ICA points to more evidentiary gaps. When it comes to
      the ICA’s contention that Putin ordered Russian military intelligence to pass
      stolen Democratic Party material to WikiLeaks and other conduits, the ICA makes
      no reference to any evidence of such an order. Instead, it points to a speculative
      guess based on a psychological reading of Putin’s perceived grievances: Putin
      most likely wanted his intelligence services to discredit Secretary Clinton because
      he has blamed her since 2011 for inciting mass protests against his regime in
      late 2011 and early 2012 and holds a grudge for comments he almost certainly saw
      as disparaging him, judging from press reporting. Given this , we assess with
      high confidence that the GRU was directed to pass material it collected to WikiLeaks
      and other intermediaries. In the public version, the January ICA suggested that
      an online persona that released stolen Democratic material, Guccifer 2.0, had
      a “likely Russian identity” tied to the GRU. But the Downgraded ICA acknowledges
      that U.S. intelligence only has “moderate confidence” that Guccifer 2.0 and another
      site, DCleaks.com, were “under direct GRU control.” By contrast, the Mueller report
      of March 2019 asserted as fact that the GRU “created” and “used both the DCLeaks
      and Guccifer 2.0 personas” to release stolen material publicly and transfer it
      to WikiLeaks. Most significantly, Gabbard’s new releases raise the question of
      how U.S. intelligence officials went from their low to moderate confidence in
      Russian interference allegations through the last months of 2016 into “high confidence”
      in the first week of January 2017, a stance they have clung to in the ensuing
      eight years even as the underpinnings of those claims have unraveled. In its memo
      on the new documents, Gabbard’s office notes that the January ICA’s assertion
      of a Putin-ordered effort to defeat Clinton claimed to be drawing on “further
      information” that had “come to light” since the 2016 election. That “further information,”
      Gabbard’s office states, was later found to be the Steele dossier, which Brennan
      and others have falsely claimed played no part in their analysis. Whatever the
      case, these new disclosures confirm that to make the case of Russian interference
      and present it to the public as a consensus view, U.S. intelligence officials
      in the Obama administration suppressed ample doubts within their highest ranks.

      made another request, asking the intelligence community to produce a new version
      of the ICA that could be made public. As Real Clear Investigations previously
      reported , and a recent CIA review has newly confirmed , that version of the ICA
      – released in January 2017 and hereafter referred to as the “January ICA” – was
      tainted by a hurried production schedule and the exclusion of key intelligence
      agencies under the close control of Brennan and Clapper. Apart from references
      to the Steele dossier – now debunked opposition research financed by Hillary Clinton’s
      campaign alleging a Trump/Russia conspiracy – it contained no new evidence that
      would have reversed the previous assessments. After ordering a replacement ICA,
      Obama administration officials moved to silence dissent. According to Gabbard
      ’s Office of the Director of National Intelligence, a senior official who “led”
      the September ICA on allegations of Russian meddling was “sidelined” from the
      new process. This unidentified official, whom Gabbard’s office describes as the
      “ODNI Whistleblower,” was shunned after “questioning his leadership about why
      an IC assessment was being created that contradicted multiple IC assessments.”
      The ODNI whistleblower also asserts that he was later pressured to accept unsupported
      findings in the January ICA, “including that the Russian government had a preference
      for President Trump.” Speculation Accepted as Fact Meanwhile, in a newly disclosed
      Dec. 7 memo written one day after Obama’s ICA tasking, the Office of the Director
      of National Intelligence acknowledged that the confidence level about alleged
      Russian hacking had barely changed. The document claimed to have “high confidence”
      that Russia had, in 2015 and 2016, hacked into networks belonging to the Democratic
      National Committee and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. But when
      it came to whether this Russian hacking actually led to exfiltration, dissemination,
      and public release to actors like WikiLeaks, the document used qualified, tepid
      language that reflected continued uncertainty. “ Most IC agencies,” the DNI wrote,
      only had “ moderate confidence that Russian services probably orchestrated at
      least some of the disclosures” of stolen Democratic Party material (emphasis added).
      The Dec. 7 DNI memo also inadvertently confirmed another evidentiary gap: a reliance
      on evidence provided by Trump’s campaign rival. The “attribution of the intrusions”
      to Russia, the DNI wrote, was “based on the forensic evidence identified by a
      private cyber-firm and the IC’s review and understanding of cyber activities by
      the Russian Government.” That private cyber-firm is CrowdStrike, which worked
      directly for the Clinton campaign, and which had triggered Russiagate the previous
      June by accusing Russia of hacking the DNC servers. As RCI previously reported
      , despite the high stakes involved, the FBI acceded to the DNC’s refusal to let
      the bureau independently analyze its server, deferring instead to CrowdStrike’s
      analysis. The timing of the FBI’s “low confidence” assessment suggests that it
      did not find CrowdStrike’s initial attribution to Russia convincing. CrowdStrike
      submitted its third and final report to the FBI on Aug. 24, three weeks before
      the September ICA recorded the FBI and NSA’s dissent on the Russian hacking allegation.
      Dec. 7th 2016: Still only “moderate confidence” in the Russian hack and leak allegation,
      and a confirmed reliance on the “forensic evidence” of Clinton contractor CrowdStrike.
      The DNI’s reliance on the forensics of a firm working for Trump’s political opponent
      – just as the FBI simultaneously relied on the Clinton-funded Steele dossier in
      its fruitless hunt for collusion – was kept under wraps. And as RCI previously
      reported , so was another critical disclosure made in closed-door congressional
      testimony one year later. In December 2017, CrowdStrike President Shawn Henry
      testified that his firm “did not have concrete evidence” that Russian hackers
      had exfiltrated data from the DNC servers. He said there were signs of potential
      Russian malware on the servers, but no evidence that any information had been
      uploaded by them. Put another way, they might have had keys to the servers, but
      there was no proof that they had removed any content. Henry’s admission to the
      House Intelligence Committee was also kept from the public throughout the Mueller
      probe. For unspecified reasons, the FBI again declined to endorse the intelligence
      assessment on alleged Russian meddling. On Dec. 8, one day after the DNI memo
      was circulated, an FBI official replied that the bureau was “drafting a dissent,”
      and asked that the ODNI “remove our seal [and] annotations of co-authorship.”
      In response, an ODNI official opined that the FBI’s “only difference” with the
      Dec. 7 memo “was over confidence level on the attribution.” The ODNI official
      also pointed out that the FBI’s disagreement was with “I&A.” This was a reference
      to the Office of Intelligence and Analysis at DHS, which had co-authored, along
      with the Clapper-run ODNI, the Oct. 7 statement that the FBI had refused to endorse,
      and that falsely claimed to speak on behalf of the “U.S. Intelligence Community.”
      The FBI’s continued dissent underscores that, by the time Obama had ordered the
      production of a new ICA, the intelligence community still had not reached consensus
      on the attribution of the email hacking to Russia. Despite the lingering divisions
      over the evidence for alleged Russian hacking, a meeting between President Obama
      and top principals just one day later claimed to have reached a united front.
      On Dec. 9, Obama huddled with top national security officials, including Clapper
      and Brennan, at the White House. Notably, the two agencies that had previously
      dissented on Russian hacking – the FBI and NSA – were not represented by their
      respective leaders, James Comey and Mike Rogers, but instead by deputies Andrew
      McCabe and Richard Ledgett. According to a newly declassified summary of that
      meeting, the Principals Committee resolved to “publicly release and attribute
      to Russian intelligence services technical and other information ... in intelligence
      reporting” from that same day. It is unclear why Obama and his principals suddenly
      felt confident publicly attributing the Democratic Party hack to Russia when the
      FBI and NSA had expressed "low confidence" in that judgment based on a lack of
      technical evidence. Dec. 9th 2016: Despite high-level dissent, President Obama
      and senior officials decide to “attribute” the DNC hack and release to “Russian
      intelligence services.” Spreading the False Narrative As Obama and senior intelligence
      officials concealed the community’s doubts about the alleged Russian hack and
      releases, as well as their reliance on a Clinton campaign contractor to investigate
      it, more false claims were leaked to the public. Two days after the DNI’s Dec.
      7 memo, the Washington Post published a story claiming that a “secret assessment”
      from the CIA had concluded that the hacking of Democratic Party emails was “part
      of a wider Russian operation to boost Trump and hurt Clinton''s chances” in the
      2016 election. A senior U.S. official told the Post that it was “the assessment
      of the intelligence community” that Russia sought “to help Trump get elected.
      That’s the consensus view.” In fact, there had been no such assessment or consensus,
      only strong doubts about the hacking allegation at the heart of the purported
      “Russian operation.” Rather than refute the erroneous Post story, the Obama administration
      continued to promote its unsupported narrative. Three weeks later, on Dec. 29,
      the Department of Homeland Security, this time joined by the FBI, issued a report
      that newly promoted the allegation of Russian email theft. Without mentioning
      the IC’s low-to-moderate confidence in Russian hacking or the integral role of
      Clinton contractor CrowdStrike, the joint report described the alleged Russian
      hacking effort as “likely leading to the exfiltration of information” from Democratic
      Party networks. It is unclear how the FBI arrived at this conclusion after voicing
      at least two previous dissents. This pattern, where privately identified evidentiary
      holes were later supplanted by publicly confident assertions, was repeated time
      and time again to advance the Russia narrative. After burying dissenting opinions
      on Russian meddling and leaking false claims to the media, Obama administration
      and intelligence officials released a newly sanitized version of the ICA on Jan.
      6, 2017. Two other versions of that document with higher levels of classification
      were produced, one of which – a “downgraded” product below the highest-level classified
      one, hereafter referred to as the Downgraded ICA – has been newly released by
      Gabbard. The Downgraded ICA points to more evidentiary gaps. When it comes to
      the ICA’s contention that Putin ordered Russian military intelligence to pass
      stolen Democratic Party material to WikiLeaks and other conduits, the ICA makes
      no reference to any evidence of such an order. Instead, it points to a speculative
      guess based on a psychological reading of Putin’s perceived grievances: Putin
      most likely wanted his intelligence services to discredit Secretary Clinton because
      he has blamed her since 2011 for inciting mass protests against his regime in
      late 2011 and early 2012 and holds a grudge for comments he almost certainly saw
      as disparaging him, judging from press reporting. Given this , we assess with
      high confidence that the GRU was directed to pass material it collected to WikiLeaks
      and other intermediaries. In the public version, the January ICA suggested that
      an online persona that released stolen Democratic material, Guccifer 2.0, had
      a “likely Russian identity” tied to the GRU. But the Downgraded ICA acknowledges
      that U.S. intelligence only has “moderate confidence” that Guccifer 2.0 and another
      site, DCleaks.com, were “under direct GRU control.” By contrast, the Mueller report
      of March 2019 asserted as fact that the GRU “created” and “used both the DCLeaks
      and Guccifer 2.0 personas” to release stolen material publicly and transfer it
      to WikiLeaks. Most significantly, Gabbard’s new releases raise the question of
      how U.S. intelligence officials went from their low to moderate confidence in
      Russian interference allegations through the last months of 2016 into “high confidence”
      in the first week of January 2017, a stance they have clung to in the ensuing
      eight years even as the underpinnings of those claims have unraveled. In its memo
      on the new documents, Gabbard’s office notes that the January ICA’s assertion
      of a Putin-ordered effort to defeat Clinton claimed to be drawing on “further
      information” that had “come to light” since the 2016 election. That “further information,”
      Gabbard’s office states, was later found to be the Steele dossier, which Brennan
      and others have falsely claimed played no part in their analysis. Whatever the
      case, these new disclosures confirm that to make the case of Russian interference
      and present it to the public as a consensus view, U.S. intelligence officials
      in the Obama administration suppressed ample doubts within their highest ranks.

    one_sentence_summary: Despite Robert Mueller's conclusion that there was no election
      conspiracy between Donald Trump and Moscow, newly declassified documents reveal
      that U.S. intelligence officials had significant doubts about the claim that Russia
      hacked and leaked Democratic Party materials to aid Trump's campaign, undermining
      the narrative of Russian interference in the 2016 election.
    paragraph_summary: Robert Mueller's investigation did not find a conspiracy between
      Donald Trump and Russia, yet he supported the narrative of Russian interference
      by claiming the Kremlin aimed to help Trump and create discord in the U.S. Recent
      declassified documents reveal that U.S. intelligence officials, particularly the
      NSA and FBI, expressed "low confidence" in the claim that Russia hacked and leaked
      Democratic Party materials to aid Trump's campaign, contradicting the widely accepted
      narrative. Tulsi Gabbard, Trump's former Director of National Intelligence, argues
      that the Obama administration manipulated intelligence to undermine Trump, suggesting
      that the evidence for Russian interference has been overstated and misrepresented
      as a consensus among intelligence agencies. This new information indicates that
      Trump's skepticism about Russian involvement was more aligned with certain intelligence
      assessments than previously acknowledged.

  - title: Under Trump, the CIA is still covering up its Russiagate fraud
    url: https://www.aaronmate.net/p/under-trump-the-cia-is-still-covering
    text: '(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images) Since his first term in the White House,
      President Donald Trump has promised accountability for Russiagate, the manufactured
      controversy in which the Hillary Clinton campaign and national security officials
      framed Trump and his associates as conspirators with Moscow. Despite investigations
      in all branches of government, Trump has yet to deliver. The most thorough probe,
      launched in Trump’s first term by Special Counsel John Durham and concluding in
      2023, faulted the FBI for relying on the Clinton-funded collection of conspiracy
      fiction known as the “Steele dossier” and other compromised material in a baseless
      hunt for Trump-Russia collusion. Yet Durham only brought two cases to trial against
      relatively minor actors, both of which ended in acquittals. Instead of wielding
      his subpoena power, Durham let many of Russiagate’s main principals ignore his
      requests for an interview . And while he exposed new malfeasance behind the Trump-Russia
      conspiracy theory, Durham left unscathed the companion, equally dubious allegation
      that Russia waged a “sweeping and systematic” campaign, as Robert Mueller and
      a legion of credulous media outlets put it, to sway the 2016 campaign in Trump’s
      favor. Durham’s timidity on that latter front was especially derelict given the
      fact that his office obtained evidence that freshly exposed “Russian interference”
      as yet another Clinton campaign-generated deceit, as I reported in June 2023 .
      Along with every other investigation and establishment media outlet, Durham also
      ignored the admission under oath that CrowdStrike – another Clinton campaign contractor
      relied on by the FBI, and the source for the foundational allegation that Russia
      stole Democratic Party emails and gave them to Wikileaks to help Trump -- in fact
      “did not have concrete evidence” of Russian hacking. A new review ordered by Trump’s
      CIA Director, John Ratcliffe, follows in the tepid, half-baked record of Russiagate
      accountability to date. The CIA examined the “ Intelligence Community Assessment”
      (ICA) , released in January 2017, which asserted with “high confidence” that Russia
      conducted a sweeping 2016 election influence campaign to install Trump in the
      White House. Rushed for publication in the last days of the Obama administration
      and drafted under the close watch of then-CIA director John Brennan, the ICA report
      cast Trump’s election victory as the product of a Kremlin plot, setting off the
      all-consuming Russia-frenzy that engulfed his presidency and further poisoned
      Washington-Moscow relations. The CIA’s new review , conducted by the Directorate
      of Analysis, does not challenge the ICA’s core allegation of a Russian influence
      campaign targeting the 2016 election. Overall, the CIA now concludes, the ICA
      employed “strong adherence to tradecraft standards,” and displayed “analytic rigor
      exceeded that of most IC [Intelligence Community] assessments.” Having accepted
      the ICA’s premise at face value, the CIA review only faults the agency for “procedural
      anomalies” on reaching one particular judgment – that Russian President Vladimir
      Putin, in launching his alleged influence campaign, “aspired” for Trump to win.
      On this front, the CIA concludes, the ICA erred by relying on a single source
      as opposed to broader corroboration. The review also endorses critiques that have
      been identified for years, including in my articles on the topic , that the ICA
      suffered from “a highly compressed production timeline, stringent compartmentation,
      and excessive involvement of agency heads” – a reference to Brennan, FBI Director
      Jim Comey, and ODNI chief James Clapper. Despite subsequent denials, the report
      makes clear that Brennan and his colleagues pushed to include the fraudulent,
      Clinton-funded “Steele dossier” in the ICA report. The FBI was in fact so bullish
      on Steele’s collusion fantasies that its “leadership made it clear that their
      participation in the ICA hinged on the Dossier’s inclusion,” the review says.
      This new detail bolsters long-held suspicions from myself and others that, contrary
      to official denials, the Steele dossier played an instrumental role in the FBI’s
      decision to launch the Trump-Russia probe in July 2016. Brennan was another dossier
      champion. In a December 2016 email, a senior CIA official warned Brennan that
      including the dossier in any context would taint “the credibility of the entire
      paper.” But Brennan, the CIA review recounts, “showed a preference for narrative
      consistency over analytical soundness.” Even shown “specific flaws” in Steele’s
      work, Brennan “appeared more swayed by the Dossier''s general conformity with
      existing theories than by legitimate tradecraft concerns.” In other words, Brennan,
      at the time the nation’s most powerful intelligence official – and later an analyst
      for the chief disseminator of Russiagate propaganda, MSNBC – prioritized his pet
      conspiracy theory over the basic tenets of his profession. As Brennan wrote to
      subordinates, “my bottomline is that I believe that the [Steele] information warrants
      inclusion in the report,” which came in the form of a two-page summary added to
      the ICA’s annex. While the heads of both the CIA and FBI rallied behind the Steele
      dossier, they deliberately excluded critical components of the US intelligence
      community. “From the outset,” the review notes, “agency heads chose to marginalize
      the National Intelligence Council (NIC), departing significantly from standard
      procedures for formal IC assessments.” The review singles out “the complete exclusion
      of key intelligence agencies,” namely the Pentagon''s Defense Intelligence Agency
      (DIA) and the Department of State’s Bureau of Intelligence and Research (INR).
      Brennan''s decision to “shut out” the DIA and INR “from any participation in such
      a high-profile assessment about an adversary’s plans and intentions was a significant
      deviation,” the review says. As I have previously written , the exclusion of these
      critical intelligence offices underscores that the ICA, contrary to the prevailing
      narrative, was not a consensus-based intelligence product on “Russian interference”
      but a highly politicized hit job. The DIA has a reputation for providing sober
      assessments resistant to political influence, as declassified reports on the covert
      US wars in Syria and Ukraine illustrate. Meanwhile, Jack Matlock, the former U.S.
      Ambassador to Moscow, has claimed that a senior official from INR informed him
      that it had reached different conclusions about alleged Russian meddling, “but
      was not allowed to express it.” The CIA review provides new evidence that Brennan
      was determined to shut out dissenting views on the core allegation of “Russian
      interference.” Shortly before intelligence analysts met for the ICA’s lone coordination
      session, Brennan informed the CIA workforce that he had met with Clapper and Comey.
      From that meeting, Brennan wrote, “there is strong consensus among us on the scope,
      nature, and intent of Russian interference in our recent Presidential election.”
      The CIA review acknowledges that this prematurely declared consensus “risked stifling
      analytic debate,” but defers to the testimony of the officials “involved in drafting
      the ICA,” who assured investigators that “they did not feel pressured to reach
      specific conclusions.” But Brennan had no need to pressure the ICA’s authors,
      given that he personally “hand-picked” them, according to Clapper’s May 2017 testimony
      , and closely managed their work product. Brennan’s enthusiasm for the Steele
      dossier and the “consensus” on “Russian interference” is fraudulent on its own
      merits. But it is particularly egregious given that he was made aware of intelligence
      in July 2016 — days before the FBI’s Russia probe was officially launched — that
      the Clinton campaign was aiming “to vilify Donald Trump by stirring up a scandal
      claiming interference by the Russian security services,” as he wrote in his own
      notes. All of Brennan’s subsequent actions indicate that he opted to abet the
      Clinton plot to frame Trump and Russia, which the CIA review does not mention.
      Despite criticizing Brennan and uncovering new details of his biased process,
      the CIA review’s overall endorsement of the January 2017 ICA’s “strong” tradecraft
      newly exemplifies that accountability for Russiagate will not emerge from within
      the intelligence community, even under new leadership. The CIA is not alone in
      its obduracy. The FBI has long refused to release critical documents used in its
      probe of alleged Russian interference, including the reports submitted to it by
      CrowdStrike, the Clinton contractor that initially accused Russia of hacking the
      DNC and then refused to let the FBI conduct its own forensic investigation of
      the party’s servers. To date, the most damning review of Russiagate remains hidden
      from public view. In March 2018, the House Intelligence Committee (HPSCI), under
      the leadership of then-Rep. Devin Nunes, produced a report that faulted the ICA
      for “significant intelligence tradecraft failings that undermine confidence in
      the ICA judgments.” This included on the core allegation – propagated by Mueller,
      and untouched by Durham – that Russia hacked the Democratic Party’s emails and
      gave them to Wikileaks. On that front, HPSCI noted that the ICA''s judgments,
      “particularly on the cyber intrusion sections, employed appropriate caveats on
      sources and identified assumptions,” – an apparent acknowledgement that intelligence
      supporting the Russian hacking allegations was far from conclusive. As part of
      their review of the ICA, HPSCI staffers produced a still-classified document that
      fleshed out the ICA''s “tradecraft failings” in greater detail. One of the chief
      authors of that report was Kash Patel, who now serves as Trump’s FBI Director.
      In a 2021 interview with me , Patel detailed his failed effort to release that
      report in the final days of Trump’s first term, and how Trump instead bowed to
      pressure from top officials including then-CIA Director Gina Haspel. Not only
      did the CIA block the report’s release, but they successfully obtained sole possession
      of it – keeping it under lock and key inside the agency’s Langley headquarters.
      “I think there were people within the IC [Intelligence Community], at the heads
      of certain intelligence agencies, who did not want their tradecraft called out,
      even though it was during a former administration, because it doesn''t look good
      on the agency itself,” Patel told me. Although the CIA successfully buried that
      HPSCI report in Trump’s first term, that could change in his second. In a new
      letter , the current HPSCI chair, Rep. Rick Crawford, urged Trump to help HPSCI
      regain access to its 2018 report and prepare it for public declassification. The
      new CIA review, Crawford added, is a “whitewash.” Although Trump’s allies have
      accurately cast the “Russia hoax” as a campaign against him and his associates,
      the consequences go far beyond partisan politics. Russiagate was an unprecedented
      intrusion by unelected national security state officials not only into the electoral
      process, but into the foreign policy of the elected president that it produces.
      Most consequentially, by accusing Moscow of a nefarious “election interference”
      campaign and incentivizing Trump to adopt hawkish policies that would dispel allegations

    paragraph_summary: Since taking office, President Donald Trump has consistently
      promised accountability for the Russiagate controversy, which he claims was a
      fabricated narrative by the Hillary Clinton campaign and national security officials
      to portray him and his associates as colluding with Russia. Despite extensive
      investigations, including a significant probe by Special Counsel John Durham that
      concluded in 2023, Trump has not achieved the accountability he sought. Durham's
      investigation criticized the FBI for relying on the discredited Steele dossier
      and other flawed materials but resulted in only two minor cases, both of which
      ended in acquittals. Furthermore, Durham failed to pursue interviews with key
      figures and did not adequately address the claims of Russian interference in the
      2016 election, which were also linked to the Clinton campaign. A new review initiated
      by Trump's CIA Director, John Ratcliffe, continues the trend of insufficient accountability
      regarding the allegations surrounding Russiagate.

  - title: The Iran war is Trump’s unconditional surrender to Israel

    text: '(Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images) [Note: this article has been updated
      following the US bombing of Iran] Since his election in 2016, Donald Trump’s political
      opponents have portrayed him as a dangerous, unstable fabulist doing the bidding
      of a malign, nuclear-armed foreign power. Having returned to the White House this
      year, Trump is proving his detractors correct on all counts but one: the location
      on the map. The rogue state that he’s colluding with — at great peril to the planet
      — is not Russia, as his most vocal detractors alleged, but Israel. Israel’s June
      13 th attack on Iran sabotaged the then-ongoing talks on a new nuclear deal with
      the United States, and Trump has gone to unprecedented lengths to support its
      aggression. Trump undercut his own Secretary of State’s claim that Israel had
      undertaken “unilateral action” by acknowledging that “we knew everything” in advance
      of what he called a “very successful attack.” Administration officials then disclosed
      that Trump had previously authorized giving Israel intelligence support for the
      bombing. Trump then called on Tehran’s 9.8 million residents to evacuate, mused
      about killing Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and declared that
      “we” – meaning Israel – “have complete and total control of the skies over Iran.”
      After Iran rejected his demand for “ unconditional surrender ”, Trump imposed
      a new deadline of two weeks, only to break it three days later by ordering a US
      military attack on three Iranian nuclear energy sites, including the deeply buried
      mountain complex Fordo, which he quickly hailed as a “great success.” Just as
      with Trump’s diplomacy with Iran, his two-week deadline turns out to have been
      a ruse whose “goal was to create a situation when everyone wasn’t expecting it,”
      a senior administration official said . To wage war on Iran, Trump and his allies
      have employed the traditional Iraq WMD playbook of ignoring or manipulating the
      available evidence to fear-monger about a foreign state marked for regime change.
      Unlike the Iraq war, where the fraudulent case for invading was mostly concocted
      in-house, Trump has outsourced the job to Israel, while not even pretending to
      care about public opinion or Congressional approval. Back in March, the US intelligence
      community assessed that “Iran is not building a nuclear weapon” and “has not reauthorized
      the nuclear weapons program... suspended in 2003.” According to US officials who
      spoke to the New York Times , “[t]hat assessment has not changed.” Moreover, the
      US has found that “not only was Iran not actively pursuing a nuclear weapon, it
      was also up to three years away from being able to produce and deliver one,” CNN
      reports , citing four sources. Whereas Dick Cheney and company went through the
      trouble of nudging subordinates to fabricate intelligence, including via torture,
      Trump does not care about seeking their imprimatur. “[M]y intelligence community
      is wrong,” Trump told reporters on Friday. White House Press Secretary Karoline
      Leavitt insisted that “Iran has all that it needs to achieve a nuclear weapon,”
      and, if authorized by Ayatollah Khamenei, “it would take a couple weeks to complete
      the production of that weapon.” In White House meetings, CIA chief John Ratcliffe
      has argued that Iran is close to a nuclear bomb and that claiming otherwise “would
      be similar to saying football players who have fought their way to the one-yard
      line don''t want to score a touchdown,” according to one US official who spoke
      to CBS News. (After the Iraq war, a “Slam dunk” basketball analogy is no longer
      available). If Trump’s intelligence community is “wrong,” who does he think is
      right? As US officials told the New York Times , the claims from Trump and his
      circle “echoed material provided by Mossad,” Israel’s intelligence agency. And
      whereas some in the government, undoubtedly those close to Trump, “find the Israeli
      estimate credible”, others believe that “Israeli assessments have been colored
      by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s desire to gain American support for his
      military campaign against Iran.” Moreover, according to multiple officials, “[n]one
      of the new assessments on the timeline to get a bomb are based on newly collected
      intelligence,” but instead on “new analysis of existing work.” In other words,
      Trump is sidelining his own intelligence community to trust a “new analysis” that
      is based on no new information, just the manipulation of a foreign government.
      Trump’s disdain for his own agencies is a particular slight to intelligence chief
      Tulsi Gabbard. “I don''t care what she said,” Trump said this week, referring
      to Gabbard’s presentation of the US intelligence consensus on Iran in March. “I
      think they [Iran] were very close to having it.” Rather than defend the agencies
      she oversees – and the record she earned challenging previous US-driven regime
      change deceptions -- Gabbard has bent the knee to Trump, and Israel by extension.
      In a social media post , Gabbard chided “the dishonest media” for taking her March
      testimony “out of context.” The US, Gabbard now claimed, “has intelligence that
      Iran is at the point that it can produce a nuclear weapon within weeks to months,
      if they decide to finalize the assembly.” Gabbard also shared video of that March
      testimony, without addressing the contradictory fact that it does not include
      any mention of her newfound claim that Iran has the capability to produce a nuclear
      bomb “within weeks to months.” Gabbard is engaging in disingenuous wordplay. If
      Israel tells America that Iran “can produce a nuclear weapon within weeks”, then
      yes, American intelligence now “has” that intelligence. That doesn’t mean it is
      true, or that American intelligence believes it, which it does not. A US official
      familiar with the available record on Iran tells me that there is no US intelligence
      assessment concluding that Iran is “weeks” away from building a nuclear weapon.
      Gabbard is only saying, therefore, that the US intelligence community has received
      “intelligence” from Israel, without mentioning that the IC does not actually endorse
      it. Moreover, pretend for a moment that the Israeli claim is correct. Gabbard’s
      caveat of “if they decide to finalize” is an acknowledgment that Iran has not
      decided to build a nuclear weapon. That’s because Iran has said it does not want
      one, and is willing to commit to that in a binding agreement — the one they were
      negotiating with the US until Trump and Israel sabotaged it, and not for the first
      time. In fact, as US intelligence officials have also predicted, Trump’s bombing
      now increases the likelihood that Iran will pursue the nuclear bomb that it has
      long foresworn. Iran claims to have moved enriched uranium stockpiles prior to
      the US bombing, which preserves its capacity to weaponize. Trump and Israel insisted,
      in the president’s words, on “unconditional surrender”: capitulation to maximalist
      US-Israeli demands that Iran end its uranium enrichment program, which it is entitled
      to have under the Non-Proliferation Treaty; and that it limit its arsenal of missiles.
      In other words, Trump and Netanyahu demanded that Iran agree to abandon its sovereignty
      and right to self-defense just as it is under attack from US-backed Israeli aggression;
      and all while US-backed Israeli mass murder in Gaza and annexation of the West
      Bank continues unimpeded. Iranian officials did not surrender. Trump, by contrast,
      cannot say the same. By enabling its bombing campaign, parroting its deceptions,
      and now going to war against Iran on its behalf, Trump has already offered an
      unconditional surrender to Israel — a betrayal that grows more dangerous by the
      day.'

      aggressive stance, as he acknowledged prior knowledge of the attack and authorized
      intelligence support for it. He has made provocative statements, including urging
      Iranian citizens to evacuate and suggesting the assassination of Iran's supreme
      leader, while imposing unrealistic deadlines for Iran's surrender. Trump's military
      response included a strike on Iranian nuclear sites, which he celebrated as a
      success, drawing parallels to the pre-Iraq War narrative of manipulating evidence
      to justify military action against perceived threats.

  - title: Trump’s pretend diplomacy enabled Israel’s war on Iran
    url: https://www.aaronmate.net/p/trumps-pretend-diplomacy-enabled
    text: '(Photo by Majid Saeedi/Getty Images) Shortly after Israel began a devastating
      attack on Iran -- which has so far killed top Iranian military leaders, nuclear
      scientists, scores of civilians, destroyed vital military assets, and damaged
      nuclear energy sites -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu delivered a
      speech filled with lies and distortions. Yet there was one notable acknowledgement
      of reality. “I want to thank President Trump for his leadership in confronting
      Iran''s nuclear weapons program,” Netanyahu said. Both Netanyahu and Trump are
      aware that there is no such program. As a US intelligence report noted in March,
      “Iran is not building a nuclear weapon and Supreme Leader Khamenei has not authorized
      the nuclear weapons program suspended in 2003.” At most, Iran has “undertaken
      activities that better position it to produce a nuclear device, if it chooses
      to do so,” a previous intelligence assessment found. While deceptively omitting
      the US government’s official stance, Netanyahu was correct to credit Trump’s “leadership”
      in confronting the non-existent Iranian threat. Although Secretary of State Marco
      Rubio claims that the Israeli strikes were a “unilateral action” in which the
      US was “not involved,” Israel could not have carried out these pulverizing strikes
      without the backing of its chief sponsor in Washington. This would be true under
      any circumstance but particularly on the eve of a new round of US-Iranian talks
      over a revised nuclear deal that Trump claimed he was committed to. Israel wanted
      to sabotage that diplomatic track, and Trump was in on it. According to Israeli
      officials , “Trump and his aides were only pretending to oppose an Israeli attack
      in public — and didn''t express opposition in private.” Earlier this week, Israeli
      officials told reporters that “Trump had tried to put the brakes on an Israeli
      strike in a call” with Netanyahu, when “in reality the call dealt with coordination
      ahead of the attack.” As one Israeli official put it: “We had a clear U.S. green
      light.” Said another : “There was full and complete coordination with the Americans.”
      The goal of the US-Israeli deception, Israeli media reports , was to “lull Iran
      into thinking an attack was not going to happen immediately.” A series of media
      reports about “rifts between Israel and Washington were false , but had not been
      denied as part of a media ruse to confuse Iran.” The Trump administration fed
      leaks to the media to make it falsely appear as if it was insisting on diplomacy
      over war. On April 16 th , for example, the New York Times published a story,
      sourced to administration officials, that Trump had “waved off” an Israeli plan
      to bomb Iran “in favor of negotiating a deal with Tehran.” In interviews and social
      media posts, Trump has made no secret of the fact that he participated in Israel’s
      campaign, and has warned of even “more brutal” attacks to come. Toward that end,
      he has ordered the deployment of US warships in the Middle East to shore up Israel’s
      assault and shield it from potential Iranian retaliation. “I always knew the date,”
      Trump told the New York Post. “Because I know everything.” Trump claimed that
      he had gave Iran “chance after chance” to reach an agreement, but “they just couldn’t
      get it done.” He added: “Certain Iranian hardliner’s spoke bravely, but they didn’t
      know what was about to happen. They are all DEAD now, and it will only get worse!”
      Trump also stressed that he gave Iran a 60-day deadline to make an agreement or
      face military action. “I gave them 60 days and they didn’t meet it,” Trump went
      on. “Today’s 61, you know. Today’s day 61.” This deadline, issued back in April
      , received little attention, but Trump and Israel both made good on it. Iran failed
      to take Trump’s threats seriously and, by all appearances, was lulled into complacency.
      According to Israeli media reports , Israel built a secret drone base inside Iranian
      territory and smuggled in advanced weaponry to take out Iranian defenses. If this
      account is accurate, and I believe it is, it represents one of the most successful
      covert operations, and security breaches, in modern history. With today’s launch
      of hypersonic missiles at Tel Aviv, Iran has begun its promised “severe” and “powerful
      response”, but it is possible that its military capabilities have been inflated
      by all sides. Another possibility is that Iran decides it has no choice but to
      pursue the nuclear weapons program that it has long sworn off. The US and Israel
      make they no secret that they seek a humiliating Iranian surrender. After initially
      showing flexibility, Trump’s top envoy for the Iran talks, Steven Witkoff, embraced
      Israeli demands that he knew Iran would reject, including zero uranium enrichment
      and restrictions on Iranian ballistic missiles. The former is a foundational issue
      for Iran, which developed its enrichment program in accordance with the nuclear
      nonproliferation treaty (NPT), and sees it as essential to its sovereignty. For
      Israel and the US, enrichment is a non-starter not because of the nuclear weapons
      but because of regime change: if Iran cannot meet domestic energy needs, then
      the government will be even more vulnerable. Israel and the US will now use the
      assault to press Iran into submission. On the eve of Israel’s assault, Witkoff
      appeared at a pro-Israel gala to tout Trump’s popularity in Israel, so much so
      that he “could be the first sitting president who could be prime minister of Israel
      at the same time.” Witkoff also declared that Iran “must never be permitted to
      enrich uranium,” and that even letting Iran retain “a large amount of missiles,”
      represents “as big an existential threat as the nuclear threat.” The US and its
      allies, he concluded to wide applause, “must stand resolute and united against
      this danger and ensure that Iran never obtains the means to achieve its deadly
      ambitions no matter what the cost.” What is Iran’s “existential threat”? Iran,
      unlike Israel, does not possess nuclear weapons. Iran, unlike the US, abided by
      the 2015 nuclear deal, which Trump withdrew from and then reimposed sanctions
      that crippled Iran’s economy and paved the way for Israel’s attack. The US has
      rebuffed repeated Iranian overtures. To illustrate, in May 2003, just weeks into
      the second Iraq war, Iran sent the Bush administration a two-page letter offering
      to address all outstanding matters, including Tehran’s support for Hezbollah.
      The Bush team initially pretended that it never received the message, and never
      bothered to respond. Perhaps most pivotally, Iran, unlike the US and Israel, has
      accepted the global consensus on how to resolve the core issue at the heart of
      all Middle East strife: Israel’s denial of Palestinian self-determination. In
      2017, Iran endorsed an offer from the Arab League to Israel that would offer regional
      peace in exchange for a “two-state solution with east Jerusalem as the capital
      of the State of Palestine.” Israel, with US support, rejects this compromise solution,
      in which Palestinians would accept just 22% of their stolen homeland, because
      it insists on denying Palestinians their freedom and stealing more of their territory.
      The US is committed to protecting this supremacist regime, no matter what the
      cost. In recent decades, that cost has included backing Israel’s West Bank settlement
      expansion spree under the guise of a “peace process”; heeding Netanyahu’s advice
      to invade Iraq; supporting Israel’s 2006 war on Lebanon; launching a dirty war
      to overthrow a key Iranian-Hezbollah ally in Syria (which Netanyahu has taken
      credit for, including in last night’s speech); and fueling Israel’s ongoing mass
      murder campaign in Gaza. In 2025, the Trump team can claim credit for a new cost
      of being Israel’s chief patron: war with Iran. Note: this article was updated
      after publication to reflect the fact that Iran has launched hypersonic missiles
      at Tel Aviv in retaliation for the Israeli attack. Aaron Mate is a reader-supported

    text: '(Security Service of Ukraine / ssu.gov.ua) An audacious Ukrainian drone attack
      on four military bases across Russia, dubbed Operation Spider’s Web, handed Moscow
      one of its worst humiliations of the war. With a fleet of inexpensive drones hidden
      inside cargo trucks, Ukrainian intelligence penetrated deep inside Russian territory
      and caused significant damage to military aircraft, including long-range, nuclear-capable
      bombers. “The strike was a serious blow, and to suggest otherwise is self-delusion
      verging on sabotage,” wrote Rybar, a popular pro-Kremlin social media channel.
      For Ukraine and its Western backers, the strikes reinforce their ability to inflict
      significant costs on Russia more than three years into an invasion that Kyiv was
      expected to lose within days — and bolster the case for continued US support.
      For Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky, the images of smoldering Russian aircraft
      “help change the rhetoric in the US,” where it can no longer be said, as Donald
      Trump argued in their Oval Office showdown, that “Ukrainians are losing this war,
      and don’t have the cards.” Added former senior Zelensky aide Oleg Ustenko: “Trump

      them.” Powerful elements in Washington would undoubtedly agree. By targeting part
      of Russia’s nuclear triad, “[s]ome officials said Ukraine’s drone attacks could
      be viewed as a gift to the United States,” the New York Times reported. Days after
      visiting Kyiv to promote his push for harsh sanctions on Russia’s trading partners,

      distancing himself from the issue, viewing it as primarily Europe's responsibility
      rather than America's.
    paragraph_summary: Recent developments have shifted the perception of U.S. involvement
      in the Ukraine conflict under President Trump, who initially expressed frustration
      with Russian President Vladimir Putin and hinted at potential sanctions. However,
      following the first Russia-Ukraine talks in three years and a subsequent call
      between Trump and Putin, it appears that Trump is distancing himself from the
      conflict, reiterating that it is "not my war." European officials now believe
      that Trump's previous threats regarding sanctions were largely symbolic and that
      he views the war as primarily a European issue, indicating a lack of commitment
      to further U.S. engagement in the situation.

      President Trump will visit the Middle East this week having failed to deliver
      on his pledge to end Israel’s annihilation of Gaza, which has resumed after a
      brief ceasefire that he helped secure. Yet he is not without opportunity. Events
      ahead of his departure underscore that Trump could achieve negotiated outcomes
      in the Middle East should he break from convention and use US leverage to promote
      diplomacy, rather than undermine it. Ahead of Trump’s four-day jaunt to Saudi
      Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, the US and Hamas brokered a deal to
      free Edan Alexander, an American-Israeli IDF soldier held in Gaza since Oct. 7,
      2023. Alexander was handed over to the Red Cross in Gaza earlier today. It is
      unclear if Trump offered any concessions, or if Hamas is undertaking a goodwill
      gesture in the hopes that he will reciprocate. In a statement, Hamas said that
      Alexander “will be released as part of the steps taken towards a ceasefire, reopen
      the crossings, and deliver aid and relief to our people in the Gaza Strip.” Israel
      has imposed a starvation siege on Gaza since March 2. To secure Alexander’s freedom,
      Trump had to defy Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who shattered the
      previous ceasefire agreement and resumed his assault on Gaza in March. Israel’s
      ongoing killing spree came after the US and Hamas came close to a side deal to
      free Alexander that same month, when Netanyahu also intervened to stop them. According
      to an account in the New York Times , US hostage envoy Adam Boehler held a series
      of productive meetings with Hamas representatives two months ago in Doha. On top
      of seeking an end to Israel’s Gaza rampage, Hamas relayed that it was “open to
      a five- to 10-year truce, in which the group would lay down its weapons.” In the
      immediate term, Hamas was willing to free Alexander in exchange for 250 Palestinian
      prisoners. But when Israel got word of their progress, Boehler “received an angry
      phone call” from Netanyahu aide Ron Dermer. This was followed by a leak to the
      media, which US officials “believed was orchestrated by Israeli officials to sabotage
      the talks.” Trump shut down Boehler’s engagement with Hamas after Israeli officials
      and their Washington allies complained. In addition to directly engaging with
      Hamas, Boehler had committed the cardinal sin of declaring that “we’re not an
      agent of Israel” – a taboo statement in Washington, where being an agent of Israel
      is a de facto prerequisite for state power. Israel’s hostility to a negotiated
      solution that would free the remaining captives is now impossible to conceal.
      “We want to bring the hostages home, but Israel is not willing to end the war,”
      Trump’s Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, reportedly told Israeli captive families,
      according to Israel’s Channel 12 . “Israel is prolonging it despite the fact that
      we don’t see where else we can go and that an agreement must be reached.” Witkoff’s
      observation, while accurate, is incomplete. Both Trump and his predecessor, Joe
      Biden, are aware that Israel has resisted a deal to free the remaining captives
      because that would take away its pretext to continue destroying and ethnically
      cleansing Gaza. Therefore, if Trump and Witkoff are serious about an agreement,
      he would have to stop bowing to Israeli dictates. Trump has shown mixed signals
      on that front. Some in the Trump camp voice disdain for Netanyahu, whose close
      ties to Trump’s first national security adviser, Mike Waltz, reportedly led to
      Waltz’s dismissal earlier this month. “In MAGA, we are not Bibi fans,” a Trump
      adviser tells the Washington Post . “Trump is adamant: He wants people to put
      the guns down.” Yet Trump has taken no concrete steps to force Israel into doing
      that. As US officials explained to the Wall Street Journal , “Trump has effectively
      given Israel the green light to advance throughout the whole of Gaza until Hamas
      changes course and lays down its arms.” In other words, Trump so far has continued
      the Biden policy of providing unrelenting cover for mass murder. As former Israeli
      ambassador Michael Herzog recently recalled, “God did the State of Israel a favor
      that Biden was the president during this period. We fought [in Gaza] for over
      a year and the administration never came to us and said, ‘ceasefire now.’ It never
      did. And that’s not to be taken for granted.” With the exception of his decision
      to engage directly with Hamas, Trump has been no different. When it comes to Israel’s
      complete blockade of Gaza, Trump has in fact surpassed his predecessor’s cruelty.
      Whereas Biden occasionally pressured Israel to allow in token amounts of aid,
      Trump has sat back for more than two months as Israel has cut off all food supplies.
      According to a new report from a global monitor, Israel has forced the “entire
      population” of Gaza into “high levels of acute food insecurity, with half a million
      people (one in five) facing starvation.” Witkoff has been logging additional miles
      holding talks with Iran, which wants the US to lift crippling sanctions in exchange
      for limitations on its nuclear program. True to form, Netanyahu and allied neoconservatives
      have pressured Trump to demand conditions that would yield either an Iranian surrender
      or US-led military strikes. After abandoning the previous Iran nuclear deal in
      2018, Trump has sent mixed messages on the current sticking point of uranium enrichment,
      which Tehran insists is a “non-negotiable” right. JD Vance has suggested that
      the US could agree so long as it is not “the kind of enrichment program that allows
      you to get to a nuclear weapon... that’s where we draw the line.” Yet Secretary
      of State Marco Rubio has claimed that if Iran wants to run a civilian nuclear
      energy program, it would have to “import enriched material” from other countries.
      If one is looking for any signs that a new Iran deal can be reached, US officials
      are claiming that Netanyahu is upset with Trump’s recent maneuvering. Trump just
      agreed to a truce with Yemen’s Iran-allied Ansar Allah, which the US had been
      bombing for weeks on Israel’s behalf. Ansar Allah, known widely as “the Houthis”,
      has agreed to stop disrupting shipping vessels in protest of Israel’s Gaza siege,
      yet Trump did not compel them to cease attacks on Israel. Trump’s chief intelligence
      official, Tulsi Gabbard, has also reaffirmed the longstanding US intelligence
      consensus that Iran does not have an active nuclear weapons program, which it
      formally barred in 2003. If Trump can break from his own record and reach a deal
      with Iran, that would be a major step forward. But ultimately, no US president
      will be able to usher in Middle East peace until the fundamental flashpoint is
      addressed: Israel’s decades-old suppression of Palestinian self-determination.
      In a recent interview , former Israeli defense minister Yoav Gallant acknowledged
      that Hamas, in launching the Oct. 7 th attack on Israel, was trying to end one
      of the world’s longest running military occupations. “[Hamas] were speaking about
      Israel withdrawing from [the West Bank]... about how to divide Jerusalem... in
      return for a [hostage] deal,” Gallant said. In other words, Hamas was seeking
      the internationally accepted solution in which Palestinians obtain a state in
      just 22% of their stolen homeland. Until a US president is willing to join Palestinian
      leaders in that historic compromise, any talk of Middle East peace will remain
      a smokescreen for perpetual US-backed Israeli aggression. Aaron Mate is a reader-supported

      concessions to facilitate this release, Hamas indicated that it was part of efforts
      toward a ceasefire and humanitarian aid for Gaza. The situation is complicated
      by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's aggressive military actions in
      Gaza, which have continued despite previous agreements. Notably, US hostage envoy
      Adam Boehler had previously engaged in productive discussions with Hamas about
      a potential long-term truce, but Israeli intervention has hindered progress.
