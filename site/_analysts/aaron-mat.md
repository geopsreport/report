summary: |
  The past 48 hours have seen significant developments in US intelligence accountability, the Iran conflict, and the ongoing fallout from the Ukraine war, each with major implications for global stability.
  
  The most notable new development is the release of a CIA review into the 2017 Intelligence Community Assessment (ICA) on alleged Russian interference in the 2016 US election. As **Aaron Maté** reports, the review upholds the ICA’s core claims but exposes “procedural anomalies,” particularly the reliance on a single source for the judgment that Putin “aspired” for Trump to win. The review also confirms that the Clinton-funded Steele dossier played a pivotal role in the ICA’s formation, despite its widely acknowledged flaws. Key intelligence agencies like the Defense Intelligence Agency and State Department’s INR were excluded from the process, raising further doubts about the ICA’s integrity. **Maté** concludes that “accountability for Russiagate will not emerge from within the intelligence community, even under new leadership,” and notes that the House Intelligence Committee is now pressing for declassification of a still-secret 2018 report that could further undermine the official narrative. There is a high chance that pressure will mount for more transparency, but entrenched resistance remains strong.
  
  Meanwhile, the US-Iran conflict continues to escalate. After Israel’s June 13 attack on Iran, President Trump authorized direct US military strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, breaking his own two-week ultimatum after just three days. **Maté** highlights that Trump’s justification for war relies almost entirely on Israeli intelligence assessments, which contradict the US intelligence community’s consensus that Iran is not actively pursuing a nuclear weapon. Trump has openly dismissed the findings of his own agencies, including CIA chief Tulsi Gabbard, in favor of Israeli claims. This marks a dramatic shift in US policy, with **Maté** arguing that Trump’s actions amount to “unconditional surrender to Israel.” The likelihood of a negotiated settlement with Iran is now extremely low, and there is a high chance that Iran will accelerate its nuclear program in response to the attacks.
  
  On Ukraine, the aftermath of Kyiv’s audacious drone strikes deep inside Russian territory continues to reverberate. The operation, which targeted Russian nuclear-capable bombers, is seen by Ukrainian officials as a demonstration of their continued leverage and ability to inflict costs on Moscow. As **Maté** notes, this has strengthened the case for continued US support to Ukraine, even as President Trump signals a desire to disengage from the conflict. There is a high chance that Ukraine will continue to pursue asymmetric operations inside Russia, further complicating any prospects for peace.
  
  **Trends and Predictions:**  
  - The US intelligence community faces renewed scrutiny over its handling of Russiagate, but entrenched interests make meaningful accountability unlikely in the near term.  
  - The US-Iran-Israel triangle is now defined by open US military involvement and reliance on Israeli intelligence, with a high risk of further escalation and regional destabilization.  
  - In Ukraine, bold operations inside Russia are likely to continue, sustaining Western support but also risking unpredictable Russian responses.
  
  Overall, the prevailing trend is one of deepening crises driven by politicized intelligence, proxy warfare, and the sidelining of diplomatic solutions. There is a high chance that these dynamics will persist, with little immediate prospect for de-escalation.

  - title: Under Trump, the CIA is still covering up its Russiagate fraud
    url: https://www.aaronmate.net/p/under-trump-the-cia-is-still-covering
    text: '(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images) Since his first term in the White House,
      President Donald Trump has promised accountability for Russiagate, the manufactured
      controversy in which the Hillary Clinton campaign and national security officials
      framed Trump and his associates as conspirators with Moscow. Despite investigations
      in all branches of government, Trump has yet to deliver. The most thorough probe,
      launched in Trump’s first term by Special Counsel John Durham and concluding in
      2023, faulted the FBI for relying on the Clinton-funded collection of conspiracy
      fiction known as the “Steele dossier” and other compromised material in a baseless
      hunt for Trump-Russia collusion. Yet Durham only brought two cases to trial against
      relatively minor actors, both of which ended in acquittals. Instead of wielding
      his subpoena power, Durham let many of Russiagate’s main principals ignore his
      requests for an interview . And while he exposed new malfeasance behind the Trump-Russia
      conspiracy theory, Durham left unscathed the companion, equally dubious allegation
      that Russia waged a “sweeping and systematic” campaign, as Robert Mueller and
      a legion of credulous media outlets put it, to sway the 2016 campaign in Trump’s
      favor. Durham’s timidity on that latter front was especially derelict given the
      fact that his office obtained evidence that freshly exposed “Russian interference”
      as yet another Clinton campaign-generated deceit, as I reported in June 2023 .
      Along with every other investigation and establishment media outlet, Durham also
      ignored the admission under oath that CrowdStrike – another Clinton campaign contractor
      relied on by the FBI, and the source for the foundational allegation that Russia
      stole Democratic Party emails and gave them to Wikileaks to help Trump -- in fact
      “did not have concrete evidence” of Russian hacking. A new review ordered by Trump’s
      CIA Director, John Ratcliffe, follows in the tepid, half-baked record of Russiagate
      accountability to date. The CIA examined the “ Intelligence Community Assessment”
      (ICA) , released in January 2017, which asserted with “high confidence” that Russia
      conducted a sweeping 2016 election influence campaign to install Trump in the
      White House. Rushed for publication in the last days of the Obama administration
      and drafted under the close watch of then-CIA director John Brennan, the ICA report
      cast Trump’s election victory as the product of a Kremlin plot, setting off the
      all-consuming Russia-frenzy that engulfed his presidency and further poisoned
      Washington-Moscow relations. The CIA’s new review , conducted by the Directorate
      of Analysis, does not challenge the ICA’s core allegation of a Russian influence
      campaign targeting the 2016 election. Overall, the CIA now concludes, the ICA
      employed “strong adherence to tradecraft standards,” and displayed “analytic rigor
      exceeded that of most IC [Intelligence Community] assessments.” Having accepted
      the ICA’s premise at face value, the CIA review only faults the agency for “procedural
      anomalies” on reaching one particular judgment – that Russian President Vladimir
      Putin, in launching his alleged influence campaign, “aspired” for Trump to win.
      On this front, the CIA concludes, the ICA erred by relying on a single source
      as opposed to broader corroboration. The review also endorses critiques that have
      been identified for years, including in my articles on the topic , that the ICA
      suffered from “a highly compressed production timeline, stringent compartmentation,
      and excessive involvement of agency heads” – a reference to Brennan, FBI Director
      Jim Comey, and ODNI chief James Clapper. Despite subsequent denials, the report
      makes clear that Brennan and his colleagues pushed to include the fraudulent,
      Clinton-funded “Steele dossier” in the ICA report. The FBI was in fact so bullish
      on Steele’s collusion fantasies that its “leadership made it clear that their
      participation in the ICA hinged on the Dossier’s inclusion,” the review says.
      This new detail bolsters long-held suspicions from myself and others that, contrary
      to official denials, the Steele dossier played an instrumental role in the FBI’s
      decision to launch the Trump-Russia probe in July 2016. Brennan was another dossier
      champion. In a December 2016 email, a senior CIA official warned Brennan that
      including the dossier in any context would taint “the credibility of the entire
      paper.” But Brennan, the CIA review recounts, “showed a preference for narrative
      consistency over analytical soundness.” Even shown “specific flaws” in Steele’s
      work, Brennan “appeared more swayed by the Dossier''s general conformity with
      existing theories than by legitimate tradecraft concerns.” In other words, Brennan,
      at the time the nation’s most powerful intelligence official – and later an analyst
      for the chief disseminator of Russiagate propaganda, MSNBC – prioritized his pet
      conspiracy theory over the basic tenets of his profession. As Brennan wrote to
      subordinates, “my bottomline is that I believe that the [Steele] information warrants
      inclusion in the report,” which came in the form of a two-page summary added to
      the ICA’s annex. While the heads of both the CIA and FBI rallied behind the Steele
      dossier, they deliberately excluded critical components of the US intelligence
      community. “From the outset,” the review notes, “agency heads chose to marginalize
      the National Intelligence Council (NIC), departing significantly from standard
      procedures for formal IC assessments.” The review singles out “the complete exclusion
      of key intelligence agencies,” namely the Pentagon''s Defense Intelligence Agency
      (DIA) and the Department of State’s Bureau of Intelligence and Research (INR).
      Brennan''s decision to “shut out” the DIA and INR “from any participation in such
      a high-profile assessment about an adversary’s plans and intentions was a significant
      deviation,” the review says. As I have previously written , the exclusion of these
      critical intelligence offices underscores that the ICA, contrary to the prevailing
      narrative, was not a consensus-based intelligence product on “Russian interference”
      but a highly politicized hit job. The DIA has a reputation for providing sober
      assessments resistant to political influence, as declassified reports on the covert
      US wars in Syria and Ukraine illustrate. Meanwhile, Jack Matlock, the former U.S.
      Ambassador to Moscow, has claimed that a senior official from INR informed him
      that it had reached different conclusions about alleged Russian meddling, “but
      was not allowed to express it.” The CIA review provides new evidence that Brennan
      was determined to shut out dissenting views on the core allegation of “Russian
      interference.” Shortly before intelligence analysts met for the ICA’s lone coordination
      session, Brennan informed the CIA workforce that he had met with Clapper and Comey.
      From that meeting, Brennan wrote, “there is strong consensus among us on the scope,
      nature, and intent of Russian interference in our recent Presidential election.”
      The CIA review acknowledges that this prematurely declared consensus “risked stifling
      analytic debate,” but defers to the testimony of the officials “involved in drafting
      the ICA,” who assured investigators that “they did not feel pressured to reach
      specific conclusions.” But Brennan had no need to pressure the ICA’s authors,
      given that he personally “hand-picked” them, according to Clapper’s May 2017 testimony
      , and closely managed their work product. Brennan’s enthusiasm for the Steele
      dossier and the “consensus” on “Russian interference” is fraudulent on its own
      merits. But it is particularly egregious given that he was made aware of intelligence
      in July 2016 — days before the FBI’s Russia probe was officially launched — that
      the Clinton campaign was aiming “to vilify Donald Trump by stirring up a scandal
      claiming interference by the Russian security services,” as he wrote in his own
      notes. All of Brennan’s subsequent actions indicate that he opted to abet the
      Clinton plot to frame Trump and Russia, which the CIA review does not mention.
      Despite criticizing Brennan and uncovering new details of his biased process,
      the CIA review’s overall endorsement of the January 2017 ICA’s “strong” tradecraft
      newly exemplifies that accountability for Russiagate will not emerge from within
      the intelligence community, even under new leadership. The CIA is not alone in
      its obduracy. The FBI has long refused to release critical documents used in its
      probe of alleged Russian interference, including the reports submitted to it by
      CrowdStrike, the Clinton contractor that initially accused Russia of hacking the
      DNC and then refused to let the FBI conduct its own forensic investigation of
      the party’s servers. To date, the most damning review of Russiagate remains hidden
      from public view. In March 2018, the House Intelligence Committee (HPSCI), under
      the leadership of then-Rep. Devin Nunes, produced a report that faulted the ICA
      for “significant intelligence tradecraft failings that undermine confidence in
      the ICA judgments.” This included on the core allegation – propagated by Mueller,
      and untouched by Durham – that Russia hacked the Democratic Party’s emails and
      gave them to Wikileaks. On that front, HPSCI noted that the ICA''s judgments,
      “particularly on the cyber intrusion sections, employed appropriate caveats on
      sources and identified assumptions,” – an apparent acknowledgement that intelligence
      supporting the Russian hacking allegations was far from conclusive. As part of
      their review of the ICA, HPSCI staffers produced a still-classified document that
      fleshed out the ICA''s “tradecraft failings” in greater detail. One of the chief
      authors of that report was Kash Patel, who now serves as Trump’s FBI Director.
      In a 2021 interview with me , Patel detailed his failed effort to release that
      report in the final days of Trump’s first term, and how Trump instead bowed to
      pressure from top officials including then-CIA Director Gina Haspel. Not only
      did the CIA block the report’s release, but they successfully obtained sole possession
      of it – keeping it under lock and key inside the agency’s Langley headquarters.
      “I think there were people within the IC [Intelligence Community], at the heads
      of certain intelligence agencies, who did not want their tradecraft called out,
      even though it was during a former administration, because it doesn''t look good
      on the agency itself,” Patel told me. Although the CIA successfully buried that
      HPSCI report in Trump’s first term, that could change in his second. In a new
      letter , the current HPSCI chair, Rep. Rick Crawford, urged Trump to help HPSCI
      regain access to its 2018 report and prepare it for public declassification. The
      new CIA review, Crawford added, is a “whitewash.” Although Trump’s allies have
      accurately cast the “Russia hoax” as a campaign against him and his associates,
      the consequences go far beyond partisan politics. Russiagate was an unprecedented
      intrusion by unelected national security state officials not only into the electoral
      process, but into the foreign policy of the elected president that it produces.
      Most consequentially, by accusing Moscow of a nefarious “election interference”
      campaign and incentivizing Trump to adopt hawkish policies that would dispel allegations
      of Russian influence, Russiagate fueled the post-2014 proxy war in Ukraine. The
      new focus on Russiagate comes as Trump struggles to fulfill yet another signature
      vow: brokering peace between Kyiv and Moscow. If Trump can make progress on his
      longstanding promise to expose the fraud behind Russiagate, perhaps that will
      make it easier to end the war that it helped produce.'
    one_sentence_summary: Despite President Trump's promises of accountability for the
      Russiagate controversy, investigations, including a thorough probe by Special
      Counsel John Durham, failed to yield significant legal consequences or accountability
      for key figures involved.
    paragraph_summary: Since taking office, President Donald Trump has consistently
      promised accountability for the Russiagate controversy, which he claims was a
      fabricated narrative by the Hillary Clinton campaign and national security officials
      to portray him and his associates as colluding with Russia. Despite extensive
      investigations, including a significant probe by Special Counsel John Durham that
      concluded in 2023, Trump has not achieved the accountability he sought. Durham's
      investigation criticized the FBI for relying on the discredited Steele dossier
      and other flawed materials but resulted in only two minor cases, both of which
      ended in acquittals. Furthermore, Durham failed to pursue interviews with key
      figures and did not adequately address the claims of Russian interference in the
      2016 election, which were also linked to the Clinton campaign. A new review initiated
      by Trump's CIA Director, John Ratcliffe, continues the trend of insufficient accountability
      regarding the allegations surrounding Russiagate.

  - title: The Iran war is Trump’s unconditional surrender to Israel
    url: https://www.aaronmate.net/p/the-iran-war-is-trumps-unconditional
    text: '(Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images) [Note: this article has been updated
      following the US bombing of Iran] Since his election in 2016, Donald Trump’s political
      opponents have portrayed him as a dangerous, unstable fabulist doing the bidding
      of a malign, nuclear-armed foreign power. Having returned to the White House this
      year, Trump is proving his detractors correct on all counts but one: the location
      on the map. The rogue state that he’s colluding with — at great peril to the planet
      — is not Russia, as his most vocal detractors alleged, but Israel. Israel’s June
      13 th attack on Iran sabotaged the then-ongoing talks on a new nuclear deal with
      the United States, and Trump has gone to unprecedented lengths to support its
      aggression. Trump undercut his own Secretary of State’s claim that Israel had
      undertaken “unilateral action” by acknowledging that “we knew everything” in advance
      of what he called a “very successful attack.” Administration officials then disclosed
      that Trump had previously authorized giving Israel intelligence support for the
      bombing. Trump then called on Tehran’s 9.8 million residents to evacuate, mused
      about killing Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and declared that
      “we” – meaning Israel – “have complete and total control of the skies over Iran.”
      After Iran rejected his demand for “ unconditional surrender ”, Trump imposed
      a new deadline of two weeks, only to break it three days later by ordering a US
      military attack on three Iranian nuclear energy sites, including the deeply buried
      mountain complex Fordo, which he quickly hailed as a “great success.” Just as
      with Trump’s diplomacy with Iran, his two-week deadline turns out to have been
      a ruse whose “goal was to create a situation when everyone wasn’t expecting it,”
      a senior administration official said . To wage war on Iran, Trump and his allies
      have employed the traditional Iraq WMD playbook of ignoring or manipulating the
      available evidence to fear-monger about a foreign state marked for regime change.
      Unlike the Iraq war, where the fraudulent case for invading was mostly concocted
      in-house, Trump has outsourced the job to Israel, while not even pretending to
      care about public opinion or Congressional approval. Back in March, the US intelligence
      community assessed that “Iran is not building a nuclear weapon” and “has not reauthorized
      the nuclear weapons program... suspended in 2003.” According to US officials who
      spoke to the New York Times , “[t]hat assessment has not changed.” Moreover, the
      US has found that “not only was Iran not actively pursuing a nuclear weapon, it
      was also up to three years away from being able to produce and deliver one,” CNN
      reports , citing four sources. Whereas Dick Cheney and company went through the
      trouble of nudging subordinates to fabricate intelligence, including via torture,
      Trump does not care about seeking their imprimatur. “[M]y intelligence community
      is wrong,” Trump told reporters on Friday. White House Press Secretary Karoline
      Leavitt insisted that “Iran has all that it needs to achieve a nuclear weapon,”
      and, if authorized by Ayatollah Khamenei, “it would take a couple weeks to complete
      the production of that weapon.” In White House meetings, CIA chief John Ratcliffe
      has argued that Iran is close to a nuclear bomb and that claiming otherwise “would
      be similar to saying football players who have fought their way to the one-yard
      line don''t want to score a touchdown,” according to one US official who spoke
      to CBS News. (After the Iraq war, a “Slam dunk” basketball analogy is no longer
      available). If Trump’s intelligence community is “wrong,” who does he think is
      right? As US officials told the New York Times , the claims from Trump and his
      circle “echoed material provided by Mossad,” Israel’s intelligence agency. And
      whereas some in the government, undoubtedly those close to Trump, “find the Israeli
      estimate credible”, others believe that “Israeli assessments have been colored
      by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s desire to gain American support for his
      military campaign against Iran.” Moreover, according to multiple officials, “[n]one
      of the new assessments on the timeline to get a bomb are based on newly collected
      intelligence,” but instead on “new analysis of existing work.” In other words,
      Trump is sidelining his own intelligence community to trust a “new analysis” that
      is based on no new information, just the manipulation of a foreign government.
      Trump’s disdain for his own agencies is a particular slight to intelligence chief
      Tulsi Gabbard. “I don''t care what she said,” Trump said this week, referring
      to Gabbard’s presentation of the US intelligence consensus on Iran in March. “I
      think they [Iran] were very close to having it.” Rather than defend the agencies
      she oversees – and the record she earned challenging previous US-driven regime
      change deceptions -- Gabbard has bent the knee to Trump, and Israel by extension.
      In a social media post , Gabbard chided “the dishonest media” for taking her March
      testimony “out of context.” The US, Gabbard now claimed, “has intelligence that
      Iran is at the point that it can produce a nuclear weapon within weeks to months,
      if they decide to finalize the assembly.” Gabbard also shared video of that March
      testimony, without addressing the contradictory fact that it does not include
      any mention of her newfound claim that Iran has the capability to produce a nuclear
      bomb “within weeks to months.” Gabbard is engaging in disingenuous wordplay. If
      Israel tells America that Iran “can produce a nuclear weapon within weeks”, then
      yes, American intelligence now “has” that intelligence. That doesn’t mean it is
      true, or that American intelligence believes it, which it does not. A US official
      familiar with the available record on Iran tells me that there is no US intelligence
      assessment concluding that Iran is “weeks” away from building a nuclear weapon.
      Gabbard is only saying, therefore, that the US intelligence community has received
      “intelligence” from Israel, without mentioning that the IC does not actually endorse
      it. Moreover, pretend for a moment that the Israeli claim is correct. Gabbard’s
      caveat of “if they decide to finalize” is an acknowledgment that Iran has not
      decided to build a nuclear weapon. That’s because Iran has said it does not want
      one, and is willing to commit to that in a binding agreement — the one they were
      negotiating with the US until Trump and Israel sabotaged it, and not for the first
      time. In fact, as US intelligence officials have also predicted, Trump’s bombing
      now increases the likelihood that Iran will pursue the nuclear bomb that it has
      long foresworn. Iran claims to have moved enriched uranium stockpiles prior to
      the US bombing, which preserves its capacity to weaponize. Trump and Israel insisted,
      in the president’s words, on “unconditional surrender”: capitulation to maximalist
      US-Israeli demands that Iran end its uranium enrichment program, which it is entitled
      to have under the Non-Proliferation Treaty; and that it limit its arsenal of missiles.
      In other words, Trump and Netanyahu demanded that Iran agree to abandon its sovereignty
      and right to self-defense just as it is under attack from US-backed Israeli aggression;
      and all while US-backed Israeli mass murder in Gaza and annexation of the West
      Bank continues unimpeded. Iranian officials did not surrender. Trump, by contrast,
      cannot say the same. By enabling its bombing campaign, parroting its deceptions,
      and now going to war against Iran on its behalf, Trump has already offered an
      unconditional surrender to Israel — a betrayal that grows more dangerous by the
      day.'
    one_sentence_summary: Since returning to the White House, Donald Trump has aligned
      himself with Israel's aggressive actions against Iran, undermining diplomatic
      efforts for a nuclear deal and confirming his critics' concerns about his dangerous
      foreign policy.
    paragraph_summary: Since his return to the White House in 2023, Donald Trump has
      intensified his controversial support for Israel, particularly following its June
      13 attack on Iran, which undermined ongoing nuclear negotiations. Contrary to
      accusations of collusion with Russia, Trump's actions have aligned with Israel's
      aggressive stance, as he acknowledged prior knowledge of the attack and authorized
      intelligence support for it. He has made provocative statements, including urging
      Iranian citizens to evacuate and suggesting the assassination of Iran's supreme
      leader, while imposing unrealistic deadlines for Iran's surrender. Trump's military
      response included a strike on Iranian nuclear sites, which he celebrated as a
      success, drawing parallels to the pre-Iraq War narrative of manipulating evidence
      to justify military action against perceived threats.

  - title: Trump’s pretend diplomacy enabled Israel’s war on Iran
    url: https://www.aaronmate.net/p/trumps-pretend-diplomacy-enabled
    text: '(Photo by Majid Saeedi/Getty Images) Shortly after Israel began a devastating
      attack on Iran -- which has so far killed top Iranian military leaders, nuclear
      scientists, scores of civilians, destroyed vital military assets, and damaged
      nuclear energy sites -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu delivered a
      speech filled with lies and distortions. Yet there was one notable acknowledgement
      of reality. “I want to thank President Trump for his leadership in confronting
      Iran''s nuclear weapons program,” Netanyahu said. Both Netanyahu and Trump are
      aware that there is no such program. As a US intelligence report noted in March,
      “Iran is not building a nuclear weapon and Supreme Leader Khamenei has not authorized
      the nuclear weapons program suspended in 2003.” At most, Iran has “undertaken
      activities that better position it to produce a nuclear device, if it chooses
      to do so,” a previous intelligence assessment found. While deceptively omitting
      the US government’s official stance, Netanyahu was correct to credit Trump’s “leadership”
      in confronting the non-existent Iranian threat. Although Secretary of State Marco
      Rubio claims that the Israeli strikes were a “unilateral action” in which the
      US was “not involved,” Israel could not have carried out these pulverizing strikes
      without the backing of its chief sponsor in Washington. This would be true under
      any circumstance but particularly on the eve of a new round of US-Iranian talks
      over a revised nuclear deal that Trump claimed he was committed to. Israel wanted
      to sabotage that diplomatic track, and Trump was in on it. According to Israeli
      officials , “Trump and his aides were only pretending to oppose an Israeli attack
      in public — and didn''t express opposition in private.” Earlier this week, Israeli
      officials told reporters that “Trump had tried to put the brakes on an Israeli
      strike in a call” with Netanyahu, when “in reality the call dealt with coordination
      ahead of the attack.” As one Israeli official put it: “We had a clear U.S. green
      light.” Said another : “There was full and complete coordination with the Americans.”
      The goal of the US-Israeli deception, Israeli media reports , was to “lull Iran
      into thinking an attack was not going to happen immediately.” A series of media
      reports about “rifts between Israel and Washington were false , but had not been
      denied as part of a media ruse to confuse Iran.” The Trump administration fed
      leaks to the media to make it falsely appear as if it was insisting on diplomacy
      over war. On April 16 th , for example, the New York Times published a story,
      sourced to administration officials, that Trump had “waved off” an Israeli plan
      to bomb Iran “in favor of negotiating a deal with Tehran.” In interviews and social
      media posts, Trump has made no secret of the fact that he participated in Israel’s
      campaign, and has warned of even “more brutal” attacks to come. Toward that end,
      he has ordered the deployment of US warships in the Middle East to shore up Israel’s
      assault and shield it from potential Iranian retaliation. “I always knew the date,”
      Trump told the New York Post. “Because I know everything.” Trump claimed that
      he had gave Iran “chance after chance” to reach an agreement, but “they just couldn’t
      get it done.” He added: “Certain Iranian hardliner’s spoke bravely, but they didn’t
      know what was about to happen. They are all DEAD now, and it will only get worse!”
      Trump also stressed that he gave Iran a 60-day deadline to make an agreement or
      face military action. “I gave them 60 days and they didn’t meet it,” Trump went
      on. “Today’s 61, you know. Today’s day 61.” This deadline, issued back in April
      , received little attention, but Trump and Israel both made good on it. Iran failed
      to take Trump’s threats seriously and, by all appearances, was lulled into complacency.
      According to Israeli media reports , Israel built a secret drone base inside Iranian
      territory and smuggled in advanced weaponry to take out Iranian defenses. If this
      account is accurate, and I believe it is, it represents one of the most successful
      covert operations, and security breaches, in modern history. With today’s launch
      of hypersonic missiles at Tel Aviv, Iran has begun its promised “severe” and “powerful
      response”, but it is possible that its military capabilities have been inflated
      by all sides. Another possibility is that Iran decides it has no choice but to
      pursue the nuclear weapons program that it has long sworn off. The US and Israel
      make they no secret that they seek a humiliating Iranian surrender. After initially
      showing flexibility, Trump’s top envoy for the Iran talks, Steven Witkoff, embraced
      Israeli demands that he knew Iran would reject, including zero uranium enrichment
      and restrictions on Iranian ballistic missiles. The former is a foundational issue
      for Iran, which developed its enrichment program in accordance with the nuclear
      nonproliferation treaty (NPT), and sees it as essential to its sovereignty. For
      Israel and the US, enrichment is a non-starter not because of the nuclear weapons
      but because of regime change: if Iran cannot meet domestic energy needs, then
      the government will be even more vulnerable. Israel and the US will now use the
      assault to press Iran into submission. On the eve of Israel’s assault, Witkoff
      appeared at a pro-Israel gala to tout Trump’s popularity in Israel, so much so
      that he “could be the first sitting president who could be prime minister of Israel
      at the same time.” Witkoff also declared that Iran “must never be permitted to
      enrich uranium,” and that even letting Iran retain “a large amount of missiles,”
      represents “as big an existential threat as the nuclear threat.” The US and its
      allies, he concluded to wide applause, “must stand resolute and united against
      this danger and ensure that Iran never obtains the means to achieve its deadly
      ambitions no matter what the cost.” What is Iran’s “existential threat”? Iran,
      unlike Israel, does not possess nuclear weapons. Iran, unlike the US, abided by
      the 2015 nuclear deal, which Trump withdrew from and then reimposed sanctions
      that crippled Iran’s economy and paved the way for Israel’s attack. The US has
      rebuffed repeated Iranian overtures. To illustrate, in May 2003, just weeks into
      the second Iraq war, Iran sent the Bush administration a two-page letter offering
      to address all outstanding matters, including Tehran’s support for Hezbollah.
      The Bush team initially pretended that it never received the message, and never
      bothered to respond. Perhaps most pivotally, Iran, unlike the US and Israel, has
      accepted the global consensus on how to resolve the core issue at the heart of
      all Middle East strife: Israel’s denial of Palestinian self-determination. In
      2017, Iran endorsed an offer from the Arab League to Israel that would offer regional
      peace in exchange for a “two-state solution with east Jerusalem as the capital
      of the State of Palestine.” Israel, with US support, rejects this compromise solution,
      in which Palestinians would accept just 22% of their stolen homeland, because
      it insists on denying Palestinians their freedom and stealing more of their territory.
      The US is committed to protecting this supremacist regime, no matter what the
      cost. In recent decades, that cost has included backing Israel’s West Bank settlement
      expansion spree under the guise of a “peace process”; heeding Netanyahu’s advice
      to invade Iraq; supporting Israel’s 2006 war on Lebanon; launching a dirty war
      to overthrow a key Iranian-Hezbollah ally in Syria (which Netanyahu has taken
      credit for, including in last night’s speech); and fueling Israel’s ongoing mass
      murder campaign in Gaza. In 2025, the Trump team can claim credit for a new cost
      of being Israel’s chief patron: war with Iran. Note: this article was updated
      after publication to reflect the fact that Iran has launched hypersonic missiles

      resulted in significant casualties and damage to military and nuclear sites, Prime
      Minister Benjamin Netanyahu delivered a speech that included misleading statements
      but acknowledged former President Trump's role in confronting Iran's nuclear program.
      Despite the US intelligence assessment stating that Iran is not actively pursuing
      nuclear weapons, Netanyahu's remarks suggested otherwise, reflecting a shared
      understanding between him and Trump about the non-existent threat. While Secretary
      of State Marco Rubio characterized the Israeli actions as unilateral, it was revealed
      that Israel's attacks were coordinated with the US, undermining ongoing diplomatic
      efforts for a revised nuclear deal with Iran. Israeli officials indicated that
      Trump's public opposition to the strikes was merely a facade, as he was actually
      supportive of the military action.

    text: '(Security Service of Ukraine / ssu.gov.ua) An audacious Ukrainian drone attack
      on four military bases across Russia, dubbed Operation Spider’s Web, handed Moscow
      one of its worst humiliations of the war. With a fleet of inexpensive drones hidden
      inside cargo trucks, Ukrainian intelligence penetrated deep inside Russian territory
      and caused significant damage to military aircraft, including long-range, nuclear-capable
      bombers. “The strike was a serious blow, and to suggest otherwise is self-delusion
      verging on sabotage,” wrote Rybar, a popular pro-Kremlin social media channel.
      For Ukraine and its Western backers, the strikes reinforce their ability to inflict
      significant costs on Russia more than three years into an invasion that Kyiv was
      expected to lose within days — and bolster the case for continued US support.
      For Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky, the images of smoldering Russian aircraft
      “help change the rhetoric in the US,” where it can no longer be said, as Donald
      Trump argued in their Oval Office showdown, that “Ukrainians are losing this war,
      and don’t have the cards.” Added former senior Zelensky aide Oleg Ustenko: “Trump
      said we don’t have the cards — this shows we do have the cards, and we can play
      them.” Powerful elements in Washington would undoubtedly agree. By targeting part
      of Russia’s nuclear triad, “[s]ome officials said Ukraine’s drone attacks could
      be viewed as a gift to the United States,” the New York Times reported. Days after
      visiting Kyiv to promote his push for harsh sanctions on Russia’s trading partners,
      Republican Senator Lindsey Graham hailed Ukraine’s “ever-resourceful” effort “to
      successfully attack Russian bombers and military assets.” As grateful proxy war
      sponsors like Graham illustrate, Ukraine had ample grounds to believe that it
      was handing the US a “gift.” Read more'

      three years, and a follow-up phone call between Trump and Putin on Monday, the
      US president is no longer talking tough against Moscow. Instead, the growing consensus
      is that Trump is set on walking away from a conflict that he has repeatedly stressed
      is “not my war.” According to European officials , “Trump never seemed invested
      in joining sanctions on Russia,” and his threats “appeared largely performative.”

      President Trump will visit the Middle East this week having failed to deliver
      on his pledge to end Israel’s annihilation of Gaza, which has resumed after a
      brief ceasefire that he helped secure. Yet he is not without opportunity. Events
      ahead of his departure underscore that Trump could achieve negotiated outcomes
      in the Middle East should he break from convention and use US leverage to promote
      diplomacy, rather than undermine it. Ahead of Trump’s four-day jaunt to Saudi
      Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, the US and Hamas brokered a deal to
      free Edan Alexander, an American-Israeli IDF soldier held in Gaza since Oct. 7,
      2023. Alexander was handed over to the Red Cross in Gaza earlier today. It is
      unclear if Trump offered any concessions, or if Hamas is undertaking a goodwill
      gesture in the hopes that he will reciprocate. In a statement, Hamas said that
      Alexander “will be released as part of the steps taken towards a ceasefire, reopen
      the crossings, and deliver aid and relief to our people in the Gaza Strip.” Israel
      has imposed a starvation siege on Gaza since March 2. To secure Alexander’s freedom,
      Trump had to defy Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who shattered the
      previous ceasefire agreement and resumed his assault on Gaza in March. Israel’s
      ongoing killing spree came after the US and Hamas came close to a side deal to
      free Alexander that same month, when Netanyahu also intervened to stop them. According
      to an account in the New York Times , US hostage envoy Adam Boehler held a series
      of productive meetings with Hamas representatives two months ago in Doha. On top
      of seeking an end to Israel’s Gaza rampage, Hamas relayed that it was “open to
      a five- to 10-year truce, in which the group would lay down its weapons.” In the
      immediate term, Hamas was willing to free Alexander in exchange for 250 Palestinian
      prisoners. But when Israel got word of their progress, Boehler “received an angry
      phone call” from Netanyahu aide Ron Dermer. This was followed by a leak to the
      media, which US officials “believed was orchestrated by Israeli officials to sabotage
      the talks.” Trump shut down Boehler’s engagement with Hamas after Israeli officials
      and their Washington allies complained. In addition to directly engaging with
      Hamas, Boehler had committed the cardinal sin of declaring that “we’re not an
      agent of Israel” – a taboo statement in Washington, where being an agent of Israel
      is a de facto prerequisite for state power. Israel’s hostility to a negotiated
      solution that would free the remaining captives is now impossible to conceal.
      “We want to bring the hostages home, but Israel is not willing to end the war,”
      Trump’s Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, reportedly told Israeli captive families,
      according to Israel’s Channel 12 . “Israel is prolonging it despite the fact that
      we don’t see where else we can go and that an agreement must be reached.” Witkoff’s
      observation, while accurate, is incomplete. Both Trump and his predecessor, Joe
      Biden, are aware that Israel has resisted a deal to free the remaining captives
      because that would take away its pretext to continue destroying and ethnically
      cleansing Gaza. Therefore, if Trump and Witkoff are serious about an agreement,
      he would have to stop bowing to Israeli dictates. Trump has shown mixed signals
      on that front. Some in the Trump camp voice disdain for Netanyahu, whose close
      ties to Trump’s first national security adviser, Mike Waltz, reportedly led to
      Waltz’s dismissal earlier this month. “In MAGA, we are not Bibi fans,” a Trump
      adviser tells the Washington Post . “Trump is adamant: He wants people to put
      the guns down.” Yet Trump has taken no concrete steps to force Israel into doing
      that. As US officials explained to the Wall Street Journal , “Trump has effectively
      given Israel the green light to advance throughout the whole of Gaza until Hamas
      changes course and lays down its arms.” In other words, Trump so far has continued
      the Biden policy of providing unrelenting cover for mass murder. As former Israeli
      ambassador Michael Herzog recently recalled, “God did the State of Israel a favor
      that Biden was the president during this period. We fought [in Gaza] for over
      a year and the administration never came to us and said, ‘ceasefire now.’ It never
      did. And that’s not to be taken for granted.” With the exception of his decision
      to engage directly with Hamas, Trump has been no different. When it comes to Israel’s
      complete blockade of Gaza, Trump has in fact surpassed his predecessor’s cruelty.
      Whereas Biden occasionally pressured Israel to allow in token amounts of aid,
      Trump has sat back for more than two months as Israel has cut off all food supplies.
      According to a new report from a global monitor, Israel has forced the “entire
      population” of Gaza into “high levels of acute food insecurity, with half a million
      people (one in five) facing starvation.” Witkoff has been logging additional miles
      holding talks with Iran, which wants the US to lift crippling sanctions in exchange
      for limitations on its nuclear program. True to form, Netanyahu and allied neoconservatives
      have pressured Trump to demand conditions that would yield either an Iranian surrender
      or US-led military strikes. After abandoning the previous Iran nuclear deal in
      2018, Trump has sent mixed messages on the current sticking point of uranium enrichment,
      which Tehran insists is a “non-negotiable” right. JD Vance has suggested that
      the US could agree so long as it is not “the kind of enrichment program that allows
      you to get to a nuclear weapon... that’s where we draw the line.” Yet Secretary
      of State Marco Rubio has claimed that if Iran wants to run a civilian nuclear
      energy program, it would have to “import enriched material” from other countries.
      If one is looking for any signs that a new Iran deal can be reached, US officials
      are claiming that Netanyahu is upset with Trump’s recent maneuvering. Trump just
      agreed to a truce with Yemen’s Iran-allied Ansar Allah, which the US had been
      bombing for weeks on Israel’s behalf. Ansar Allah, known widely as “the Houthis”,
      has agreed to stop disrupting shipping vessels in protest of Israel’s Gaza siege,
      yet Trump did not compel them to cease attacks on Israel. Trump’s chief intelligence
      official, Tulsi Gabbard, has also reaffirmed the longstanding US intelligence
      consensus that Iran does not have an active nuclear weapons program, which it
      formally barred in 2003. If Trump can break from his own record and reach a deal
      with Iran, that would be a major step forward. But ultimately, no US president
      will be able to usher in Middle East peace until the fundamental flashpoint is
      addressed: Israel’s decades-old suppression of Palestinian self-determination.
      In a recent interview , former Israeli defense minister Yoav Gallant acknowledged
      that Hamas, in launching the Oct. 7 th attack on Israel, was trying to end one
      of the world’s longest running military occupations. “[Hamas] were speaking about
      Israel withdrawing from [the West Bank]... about how to divide Jerusalem... in
      return for a [hostage] deal,” Gallant said. In other words, Hamas was seeking
      the internationally accepted solution in which Palestinians obtain a state in
      just 22% of their stolen homeland. Until a US president is willing to join Palestinian
      leaders in that historic compromise, any talk of Middle East peace will remain
      a smokescreen for perpetual US-backed Israeli aggression. Aaron Mate is a reader-supported
